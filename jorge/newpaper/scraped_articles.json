The battle continues and we must, but we are more prepared. We need to stay vigilant with social distancing, it remains an imperative. We are a resilient nation and I am confident that we will emerge from this pandemic stronger together.\u201d \u201cDo we have the coronavirus contained?\u201d \u201cRight now, it depends on what you mean by containment. If you think that we have it completely under control, we don\u2019t. I mean, if you look at the dynamics of the outbreak we are seeing a diminution of hospitalizations and infections in some places such as in New York City, which has plateaued and started to come down \u2014 New Orleans \u2014 but in other parts of the country, we are seeing spikes. So I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t do better on testing, on contact tracing and on social distancing, will deaths from coronavirus necessarily increase?\u201d Of course, if you do not do an adequate response we will have the deleterious consequence of more infections and more deaths. If we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes, given that it is without a doubt that there will be infections that will be in the community, then we run the risk of having a resurgence. I would hope by that point in time in the fall that we have more than enough to respond adequately. But if we don\u2019t, there will be problems.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re all noble public servants, but I worry that you\u2019re trying to have it both ways. You say the states shouldn\u2019t open too early, but then you don\u2019t give us the resources to succeed. You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance that you\u2019ve given us. And then the guidance that you have provided is criminally vague. Obviously the plan to reopen America was meant to be followed by more detailed, nuanced guidance. Why didn\u2019t this plan get released? And if it is just being reviewed, when is it going to be released?\u201d \u201cWe have generated a series of guidances as you know. And this outbreak response has evolved from the C.D.C. to an all of government response. As we work through the guidances, a number of them go for interagency review and get every agency input to make sure that these guidances are more broadly applicable for different parts of our society. The guidances that you\u2019ve talked about have gone through that interagency review, their comments that have come back to C.D.C., and I anticipate they\u2019ll go back up into the task force for final review.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re reopening in Connecticut in five days, in 10 days. This guidance isn\u2019t going to be useful to us in two weeks. So is it this week, is it next week, when are we going to get this expertise from the federal government?\u201d \u201cI do anticipate this broader guidance, though, to be posted on the C.D.C. website soon. I can\u2019t tell you \u2014 soon \u2014 but I can tell you your state can reach out to C.D.C., and we\u2019ll give guidance directly to anyone in your state on any circumstance that your state desires guidance from.\u201d \u201cSoon, isn\u2019t terribly helpful. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\u201d \u201cI think the one size fits all that we\u2019re going to do a national strategy, and nobody is going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district. So I think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what\u2019s best for the economy. And as much as I respect you Dr. Fauci, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the end all. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the one person that gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other side saying there\u2019s not going to be a surge.\u201d \u201cI have never made myself out to be the end all and only voice in this. I\u2019m a scientist, a physician and a public health official. I give advice according to the best scientific evidence. There are a number of other people who come into that, and give advice that are more related to the things that you spoke about \u2014 the need to get the country back open again and economically. I don\u2019t give advice about economic things. I don\u2019t give advice about anything other than public health. So I want to respond to that. The second thing is that you used the words, \u2018we should be humble about what we don\u2019t know.\u2019 And I think that falls under the fact that we don\u2019t know everything about this virus, and we really better be very careful, particularly when it comes to children because the more and more we learn, we\u2019re seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn\u2019t see from the studies in China or in Europe. For example, right now children presenting with Covid-16 \u2014 Covid-19 \u2014 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome, very similar to Kawasaki Syndrome. I think we\u2019ve got to be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects. So again, you\u2019re right in the numbers that children in general do much, much better than adults and the elderly, and particularly those with underlying conditions. But I am very careful, and hopefully humble, in knowing that I don\u2019t know everything about this disease.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nToday: As Europe begins to reopen, and countries like Germany send children back to school. Why the country that was the most skeptical of the virus may be the slowest to reopen. Mark Landler on the situation in Britain. It\u2019s Tuesday, May 12. Mark, how would you describe Boris Johnson\u2019s original approach to the coronavirus?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell I\u2019d say initially, he was really kind of out to lunch on it. You know, remember, the earliest days of the virus in late January, early February coincided with Britain formally leaving the European Union.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.\n\nmark landler\n\nIn those early days, Johnson was really very preoccupied and distracted by the milestone of Brexit.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success. And whatever the bumps in the road ahead, I know that we will succeed.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo there were several very key early meetings of his cabinet that he didn\u2019t attend, where the subject of the virus came up. And then even when you began to see the first cases in Britain, and it became clear that Britain also faced a major risk, he affected an air of nonchalance.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe even sort of made light of some of the caution of the scientists. There was a very early press conference on March 3 where he made a point of saying he\u2019d visited coronavirus patients at a hospital, and he went around and shook all their hands.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I was at a hospital the other night where \u2014 I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you\u2019ll be pleased to know. And I continue to shake hands and I think it\u2019s very important that we \u2014 people obviously can make up their own minds, I think \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then, as if seeking validation, he turned to the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, who was standing next to him \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I think the scientific evidence is \u2014 well, I\u2019ll hand it over to the experts.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd the scientific advisor was shaking his head with pursed lips.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But our judgement is wash. Washing your hands is the crucial thing.\n\nmark landler\n\nThis is a guy who has his own way of living, and very much a live-and-let-live philosophy, and I think he brought an element of that to the early days of this crisis.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, there are obvious ways in which the story you\u2019re describing echoes what we saw here in the U.S., and with President Trump\u2019s initial response to the coronavirus. Having covered both our White House and now Downing Street, are there notable differences in the way the two countries and the two governments responded to their leaders dismissing the severity of the situation?\n\nmark landler\n\nOh, yeah. I think there are stark differences. And I would group them in a couple of categories. First, in the United States, you obviously have independent minded governors who chose to respond to the crisis for their own states, regardless of what President Trump\u2019s decisions and signals were on the federal level. You don\u2019t have that here in Britain. Here, Downing Street, the rime minister, really sets the policy for the whole country. So that\u2019s one obvious difference. I think somewhat more subtly is the role of the scientific community. In the United States, you had the C.D.C., Dr. Anthony Fauci and others very quickly and urgently calling for a very rigorous response for lockdowns. Here, on the other hand, you had a scientific community that took a slightly maverick initial response to this virus. There were very prominent scientists who advised the government who were arguing that maybe the best way to deal with the virus is to let it rip through the population, to let the population develop what they call herd immunity. And that that would build up a natural immunity that would make Britain more resilient to subsequent potential waves of infection. So this was an idea that was circulating in the scientific community in those early weeks \u2014 late February, early March \u2014 and it, to some extent, also informed where Boris Johnson was coming down on these issues. Unlike in the United States, where Donald Trump has blown hot and cold on his scientific advisors, Boris Johnson has said from the very start, I will be guided by the science. The wrinkle is that in those early days, the science was also calling for a more casual reaction. And that\u2019s what you saw in the first two weeks of March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating. So given that, what ends up being the official approach to this in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, in the second week of March \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you very much for coming.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson has a daily news conference, very similar to what you saw in the White House with President Trump.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We\u2019ve done what can be done to contain this disease.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd at that news conference, he begins to urge a very mild form of social distancing.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We are considering the question of banning major public events, such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that this banning such events will have little effect on the spread.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut he\u2019s stopping well short of asking people to quarantine themselves in their houses, closing restaurants, closing bars. All of things, by the way, that are being done by France, by parts of Germany, by Spain, by Italy. So at that point, Britain is a clear outrider, and you\u2019re really seeing the British go off in a very different direction that is really very striking, and beginning to draw notice all over Europe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm hmm.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then on March 16, Imperial College, which is one of the leading institutions in Britain that studies infectious diseases, published a report that changed everything. The headline of the report was basically that if the British government allowed the virus to spread through the population unchecked, it risked anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 fatalities.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmark landler\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this report was written by an epidemiologist called Neil Ferguson. He\u2019s probably the leading figure on epidemics and infectious disease in this country, and his reports and his pronouncements have almost a sort of a holy writ quality to them. He\u2019s really viewed as something of an oracle in this area. And the report essentially terrified everyone inside the British government. And you could almost see the change in the thinking take shape over the subsequent days as Boris Johnson continued to appear on television, each day looking a little more rattled, a little more anxious. And then finally on Monday, March 23 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good evening. The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.\n\nmark landler\n\nJohnson addressed the nation at around 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction: You must stay at home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. If you don\u2019t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo you now finally had Britain in alignment with Italy, with Spain, with France, in a total lockdown.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut it was at least a week to 10 days later than those other countries had acted, so in essence, Britain lost some valuable days. And sure enough, events began to vindicate that very dark picture.\n\narchived recording Some breaking news coming into us from NHS England, and it is an update of some of the numbers of those who have sadly died.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe death toll begins mounting. The hospitals begin filling up. And in fact, and most dramatically, perhaps, the virus actually makes its way into the political establishment of the government.\n\narchived recording Now proof that the virus can affect anyone came earlier on Wednesday, when it was confirmed \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nThe first dramatic moment comes when Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, announces that he\u2019s tested positive.\n\narchived recording He has been displaying mild symptoms, but otherwise remains in good health, and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\n\nmark landler\n\nA few days later, you begin hearing that senior officials in the government are testing positive. The health secretary, the man most directly responsible for leading the response to the crisis, has to quarantine himself. He has symptoms. The chief medical officer is quarantining himself. He has symptoms. And then on March 27 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Hi, folks. I want to bring you up to speed with something that\u2019s happening today, which is that I\u2019ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That\u2019s to say, a temperature and a persistent cough.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson announces to the British public that he has tested positive for coronavirus and will be going into isolation.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight back against coronavirus. And I want to thank \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nSo what you see in that first week is Boris Johnson recording videos in which he says, I\u2019m still at the helm, I\u2019m still directing policy. He runs several crisis meetings from his apartment adjacent to 10 Downing Street. So he\u2019s isolated, but he\u2019s in command. That\u2019s the very reassuring message that he\u2019s trying to send. But then you arrive at an important weekend, the weekend of April 5, when Queen Elizabeth is going to address the nation on this national challenge of the pandemic. And she\u2019s delivered a handful of such addresses in her 68-year reign, so this is a very big, historic moment for the country.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) I\u2019m speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe addresses the nation early in the evening.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe finishes her address \u2014\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd about an hour later, Downing Street puts out a press release saying Boris Johnson has entered the hospital.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Mark, what happens once Boris Johnson enters the hospital?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, the first thing that happens is there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty over who would actually run the government were he to be incapacitated for a long time, or God forbid, not come back at all. Britain, unlike the United States, doesn\u2019t have a clear line of succession for the head of the government. But then you kind of enter this very unsettling period where the government is continuing to put out reassuring press releases. They invariably say the prime minister is in, quote, \u201cgood spirits.\u201d But his top aides acknowledge that no one\u2019s talked to him for several days. His doctors are not releasing any status reports on his condition. And there starts to be this undercurrent of worry in the country that things are actually maybe worse than we think. And then sure enough, a few days later comes the really alarming news \u2014\n\narchived recording (dominic raab) During the course of this afternoon, the prime minister\u2019s condition worsened, and on the advice of the medical team, he was moved into a critical care unit.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe\u2019s actually been admitted to the intensive care unit. Statistically, the odds of patients decline rapidly when they go into the I.C.U. And so there is a sense, a real sense, that Boris Johnson may not make it.\n\narchived recording 1 This is obviously an extremely serious situation. I mean, how worried should people be about his health and about who\u2019s in charge of the government? archived recording 2 Well, the government\u2019s business will continue. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure, the prime minister\u2019s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut then there\u2019s sort of good news.\n\narchived recording We got this statement from 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\n\nmark landler\n\nYou start to hear better things. He\u2019s beginning to walk around a bit, he\u2019s beginning to read some briefing papers. And then on Easter Sunday, of all days \u2014\n\narchived recording The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now been discharged from hospital as he continues his recovery from Covid-19.\n\nmark landler\n\nWe get the news that Boris Johnson has been discharged from the hospital. And of course, the timing occasions some classic British humor. Senior government officials are heard saying to each other, he has risen, and referring to Boris as the Messiah. And for the country, the moment of peak anxiety, the moment where they genuinely thought they might have lost their leader, has passed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, I\u2019m curious how Brits responded to all of this. I could see this being an obvious moment for the British people to turn on Boris Johnson. He was slow to act, he took risks, he was pretty dismissive of the coronavirus. It would be easy to see all of this as the actions of an irresponsible leader that almost cost him his own life, and deprived the country of its prime minister.\n\nmark landler\n\nThat\u2019s a very plausible assumption to make. But oddly, it isn\u2019t the way it played out. And I think the reason it is isn\u2019t has to do with the rather clever way that Boris Johnson handled his own illness.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon. I have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS has saved my life. No question.\n\nmark landler\n\nOn the day he was released from the hospital, he recorded this very heartfelt video, in which he thanked the doctors and nurses at the hospital for saving his life.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I\u2019m going to forget some names, so please forgive me. But I want to thank Po Ling and Shannon and Emily and Angel and Connie and Becky and Rachael and Nicky \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nHe singled out two of the nurses \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Jenny from New Zealand \u2014 Invercargill, on the South Island, to be exact \u2014 and Luis from Portugal near Porto.\n\nmark landler\n\n\u2014 who kept a vigil at his bedside all night long, giving him oxygen.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) For every second of the night, they were watching, and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe NHS in this country is a revered institution, and so Boris Johnson very much tied himself to that institution and made his own personal story part of a broader narrative. And in so doing, he kept the support of the public far from turning on him, far from telling him you got what you deserved. I think a lot of people in this country were sympathetic to him, and it\u2019s really all the more remarkable when you consider that in the days and weeks since he left the hospital, the death toll from coronavirus in this country has continued to spiral upward. And as of a week ago or so, Britain now has the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe, and the second largest number of deaths of any country in the world, after the United States. And yet, even with that tragic human cost of this virus, Boris Johnson and his government retain the support of something like 51 percent , 52 percent of the people who approve of the way that they\u2019ve handled this virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mark, where are we right now in Britain? I mean, we\u2019re watching the world \u2014 Europe in particular \u2014 start to figure out what reopening is supposed to look like. Given this up-and-down history that you just recounted, what are you seeing that look like in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, so Britain is facing this increasing pressure to restart its economy, to ease the lockdown, to try to bring society back to some level of normalcy. And you\u2019re beginning to see the Italians, the Spanish, the Germans lift their lockdown. Britain reaches that same moment, and Boris Johnson announces he\u2019s going to give a speech to the nation in which he\u2019s going to lay out a roadmap. And there\u2019s a tremendous burst of hope that we are at the end of this difficult period. Some of the tabloids talk about the end of the lockdown, and the happy days that lie ahead. And so on Sunday night \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2014 your freedom.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson does appear and he delivers this fairly detailed speech.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) So I want to provide, tonight, for you, the shape of a plan, both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a roadmap for reopening society.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe lays out all sorts of benchmarks and criterias.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance, those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. In step two, at the earliest, by June the first, after half term, we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut when you actually go back and read his words \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And step three, at the earliest by July, and subject to all these conditions and further the scientific advice \u2014 if and only if the numbers support it \u2014 we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they\u2019re safe and enforce social distancing.\n\nmark landler\n\nReally, nothing much has changed. He\u2019s given a very dramatic speech in which he has barely budged the policy.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And so, no. This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. So his speech about reopening is really about how Britain is not about to truly reopen.\n\nmark landler\n\nYes. This turns out to be a speech that, when you really analyze it, is about why we are going to continue to live under a lockdown \u2014 one that might be tweaked at the edges here and there, there might be slight shifts \u2014 but fundamentally, nothing is changing in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s kind of remarkable how everything is flipped. Meantime, neighboring, more progressive countries like Germany, which took the virus so seriously from the beginning, are now announcing relatively aggressive reopening plans, and here we have Britain taking this far more cautious approach. It all seems quite scrambled, and I wonder what you make of that.\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, it\u2019s interesting. Every country had to make a choice about how to deal with something that is fundamentally so mysterious and so unpredictable. And the choices these countries made played out in ways that were either fortunate and successful, or tragic and largely unsuccessful. And that in turn has very much driven the way that these countries have dealt with this moment \u2014 the moment where they lift the lockdown. And so you have in Germany a country that, as you say, took the threat extremely seriously at the beginning, was very conservative, was very cautious, went to a lockdown, took the science of it extremely seriously. In Germany, the caution paid off. The death tolls stayed low. And now, as we come to this moment of lifting the lockdown, the Germans have the confidence to be brave, to take some risks, to lift elements of the lockdown, even at the risk of kicking up the infection rate. And conversely, here in England, where they came into this crisis with such an air of self-confidence, they\u2019ve now been rattled to their core. They\u2019ve really had their confidence shaken. And far from being brave or bold at this moment, they\u2019re now the country that\u2019s reacting with extreme caution. This libertarian country is now ready to keep the heavy hand of government in place, as long as it takes. And so you really see a role reversal that reflects how this virus has struck different countries, how the experiences that they\u2019ve undergone have been so starkly different. And as a result, how they\u2019re going to emerge from this period is sometimes extremely unexpected. And in Britain, it\u2019s been perhaps the most unexpected of all. The country that took this pandemic the least seriously is arguably going to now take it more seriously than anybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, thank you very much.\n\nmark landler\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Monday, countries across the world took some of their biggest steps yet toward easing restrictions on their citizens\u2019 movements. Spain began permitting small gatherings of up to 10 people, and for small shops to reopen. France allowed residents to leave their homes without filling out release forms for the first time in eight weeks.\n\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Russia announced the end of nationwide stay at home restrictions, despite a recent rise in infections. And \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If you look at all of those people over there, every one of them, from what I see, these are White House staffers, they\u2019re White House representatives, they\u2019re White House executives, and everybody has a mask on. We\u2019ve had \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe White House has instituted a new rule, requiring that all employees wear masks inside the West Wing after two aides tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording Were you the one who required that, sir? archived recording (donald trump) Yeah, I did. I did. I required it, yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut the policy is not expected to apply to either the president or the vice president, who, for weeks have avoided wearing masks. An attitude that The Times reports have trickled down to staff members, creating a dangerous situation.\n\n[music]", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/world/europe/coronavirus-britain-boris-johnson.html", "published": "2020-05-10T20:57:49", "title": "Britain to Impose Quarantine on Air Travelers to Fight Coronavirus", "text": "It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom, your freedom, of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nToday: As Europe begins to reopen, and countries like Germany send children back to school. Why the country that was the most skeptical of the virus may be the slowest to reopen. Mark Landler on the situation in Britain. It\u2019s Tuesday, May 12. Mark, how would you describe Boris Johnson\u2019s original approach to the coronavirus?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell I\u2019d say initially, he was really kind of out to lunch on it. You know, remember, the earliest days of the virus in late January, early February coincided with Britain formally leaving the European Union.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.\n\nmark landler\n\nIn those early days, Johnson was really very preoccupied and distracted by the milestone of Brexit.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success. And whatever the bumps in the road ahead, I know that we will succeed.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo there were several very key early meetings of his cabinet that he didn\u2019t attend, where the subject of the virus came up. And then even when you began to see the first cases in Britain, and it became clear that Britain also faced a major risk, he affected an air of nonchalance.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe even sort of made light of some of the caution of the scientists. There was a very early press conference on March 3 where he made a point of saying he\u2019d visited coronavirus patients at a hospital, and he went around and shook all their hands.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I was at a hospital the other night where \u2014 I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you\u2019ll be pleased to know. And I continue to shake hands and I think it\u2019s very important that we \u2014 people obviously can make up their own minds, I think \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then, as if seeking validation, he turned to the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, who was standing next to him \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I think the scientific evidence is \u2014 well, I\u2019ll hand it over to the experts.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd the scientific advisor was shaking his head with pursed lips.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But our judgement is wash. Washing your hands is the crucial thing.\n\nmark landler\n\nThis is a guy who has his own way of living, and very much a live-and-let-live philosophy, and I think he brought an element of that to the early days of this crisis.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, there are obvious ways in which the story you\u2019re describing echoes what we saw here in the U.S., and with President Trump\u2019s initial response to the coronavirus. Having covered both our White House and now Downing Street, are there notable differences in the way the two countries and the two governments responded to their leaders dismissing the severity of the situation?\n\nmark landler\n\nOh, yeah. I think there are stark differences. And I would group them in a couple of categories. First, in the United States, you obviously have independent minded governors who chose to respond to the crisis for their own states, regardless of what President Trump\u2019s decisions and signals were on the federal level. You don\u2019t have that here in Britain. Here, Downing Street, the rime minister, really sets the policy for the whole country. So that\u2019s one obvious difference. I think somewhat more subtly is the role of the scientific community. In the United States, you had the C.D.C., Dr. Anthony Fauci and others very quickly and urgently calling for a very rigorous response for lockdowns. Here, on the other hand, you had a scientific community that took a slightly maverick initial response to this virus. There were very prominent scientists who advised the government who were arguing that maybe the best way to deal with the virus is to let it rip through the population, to let the population develop what they call herd immunity. And that that would build up a natural immunity that would make Britain more resilient to subsequent potential waves of infection. So this was an idea that was circulating in the scientific community in those early weeks \u2014 late February, early March \u2014 and it, to some extent, also informed where Boris Johnson was coming down on these issues. Unlike in the United States, where Donald Trump has blown hot and cold on his scientific advisors, Boris Johnson has said from the very start, I will be guided by the science. The wrinkle is that in those early days, the science was also calling for a more casual reaction. And that\u2019s what you saw in the first two weeks of March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating. So given that, what ends up being the official approach to this in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, in the second week of March \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you very much for coming.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson has a daily news conference, very similar to what you saw in the White House with President Trump.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We\u2019ve done what can be done to contain this disease.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd at that news conference, he begins to urge a very mild form of social distancing.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We are considering the question of banning major public events, such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that this banning such events will have little effect on the spread.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut he\u2019s stopping well short of asking people to quarantine themselves in their houses, closing restaurants, closing bars. All of things, by the way, that are being done by France, by parts of Germany, by Spain, by Italy. So at that point, Britain is a clear outrider, and you\u2019re really seeing the British go off in a very different direction that is really very striking, and beginning to draw notice all over Europe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm hmm.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then on March 16, Imperial College, which is one of the leading institutions in Britain that studies infectious diseases, published a report that changed everything. The headline of the report was basically that if the British government allowed the virus to spread through the population unchecked, it risked anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 fatalities.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmark landler\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this report was written by an epidemiologist called Neil Ferguson. He\u2019s probably the leading figure on epidemics and infectious disease in this country, and his reports and his pronouncements have almost a sort of a holy writ quality to them. He\u2019s really viewed as something of an oracle in this area. And the report essentially terrified everyone inside the British government. And you could almost see the change in the thinking take shape over the subsequent days as Boris Johnson continued to appear on television, each day looking a little more rattled, a little more anxious. And then finally on Monday, March 23 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good evening. The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.\n\nmark landler\n\nJohnson addressed the nation at around 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction: You must stay at home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. If you don\u2019t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo you now finally had Britain in alignment with Italy, with Spain, with France, in a total lockdown.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut it was at least a week to 10 days later than those other countries had acted, so in essence, Britain lost some valuable days. And sure enough, events began to vindicate that very dark picture.\n\narchived recording Some breaking news coming into us from NHS England, and it is an update of some of the numbers of those who have sadly died.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe death toll begins mounting. The hospitals begin filling up. And in fact, and most dramatically, perhaps, the virus actually makes its way into the political establishment of the government.\n\narchived recording Now proof that the virus can affect anyone came earlier on Wednesday, when it was confirmed \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nThe first dramatic moment comes when Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, announces that he\u2019s tested positive.\n\narchived recording He has been displaying mild symptoms, but otherwise remains in good health, and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\n\nmark landler\n\nA few days later, you begin hearing that senior officials in the government are testing positive. The health secretary, the man most directly responsible for leading the response to the crisis, has to quarantine himself. He has symptoms. The chief medical officer is quarantining himself. He has symptoms. And then on March 27 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Hi, folks. I want to bring you up to speed with something that\u2019s happening today, which is that I\u2019ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That\u2019s to say, a temperature and a persistent cough.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson announces to the British public that he has tested positive for coronavirus and will be going into isolation.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight back against coronavirus. And I want to thank \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nSo what you see in that first week is Boris Johnson recording videos in which he says, I\u2019m still at the helm, I\u2019m still directing policy. He runs several crisis meetings from his apartment adjacent to 10 Downing Street. So he\u2019s isolated, but he\u2019s in command. That\u2019s the very reassuring message that he\u2019s trying to send. But then you arrive at an important weekend, the weekend of April 5, when Queen Elizabeth is going to address the nation on this national challenge of the pandemic. And she\u2019s delivered a handful of such addresses in her 68-year reign, so this is a very big, historic moment for the country.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) I\u2019m speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe addresses the nation early in the evening.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe finishes her address \u2014\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd about an hour later, Downing Street puts out a press release saying Boris Johnson has entered the hospital.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Mark, what happens once Boris Johnson enters the hospital?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, the first thing that happens is there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty over who would actually run the government were he to be incapacitated for a long time, or God forbid, not come back at all. Britain, unlike the United States, doesn\u2019t have a clear line of succession for the head of the government. But then you kind of enter this very unsettling period where the government is continuing to put out reassuring press releases. They invariably say the prime minister is in, quote, \u201cgood spirits.\u201d But his top aides acknowledge that no one\u2019s talked to him for several days. His doctors are not releasing any status reports on his condition. And there starts to be this undercurrent of worry in the country that things are actually maybe worse than we think. And then sure enough, a few days later comes the really alarming news \u2014\n\narchived recording (dominic raab) During the course of this afternoon, the prime minister\u2019s condition worsened, and on the advice of the medical team, he was moved into a critical care unit.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe\u2019s actually been admitted to the intensive care unit. Statistically, the odds of patients decline rapidly when they go into the I.C.U. And so there is a sense, a real sense, that Boris Johnson may not make it.\n\narchived recording 1 This is obviously an extremely serious situation. I mean, how worried should people be about his health and about who\u2019s in charge of the government? archived recording 2 Well, the government\u2019s business will continue. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure, the prime minister\u2019s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut then there\u2019s sort of good news.\n\narchived recording We got this statement from 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\n\nmark landler\n\nYou start to hear better things. He\u2019s beginning to walk around a bit, he\u2019s beginning to read some briefing papers. And then on Easter Sunday, of all days \u2014\n\narchived recording The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now been discharged from hospital as he continues his recovery from Covid-19.\n\nmark landler\n\nWe get the news that Boris Johnson has been discharged from the hospital. And of course, the timing occasions some classic British humor. Senior government officials are heard saying to each other, he has risen, and referring to Boris as the Messiah. And for the country, the moment of peak anxiety, the moment where they genuinely thought they might have lost their leader, has passed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, I\u2019m curious how Brits responded to all of this. I could see this being an obvious moment for the British people to turn on Boris Johnson. He was slow to act, he took risks, he was pretty dismissive of the coronavirus. It would be easy to see all of this as the actions of an irresponsible leader that almost cost him his own life, and deprived the country of its prime minister.\n\nmark landler\n\nThat\u2019s a very plausible assumption to make. But oddly, it isn\u2019t the way it played out. And I think the reason it is isn\u2019t has to do with the rather clever way that Boris Johnson handled his own illness.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon. I have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS has saved my life. No question.\n\nmark landler\n\nOn the day he was released from the hospital, he recorded this very heartfelt video, in which he thanked the doctors and nurses at the hospital for saving his life.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I\u2019m going to forget some names, so please forgive me. But I want to thank Po Ling and Shannon and Emily and Angel and Connie and Becky and Rachael and Nicky \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nHe singled out two of the nurses \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Jenny from New Zealand \u2014 Invercargill, on the South Island, to be exact \u2014 and Luis from Portugal near Porto.\n\nmark landler\n\n\u2014 who kept a vigil at his bedside all night long, giving him oxygen.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) For every second of the night, they were watching, and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe NHS in this country is a revered institution, and so Boris Johnson very much tied himself to that institution and made his own personal story part of a broader narrative. And in so doing, he kept the support of the public far from turning on him, far from telling him you got what you deserved. I think a lot of people in this country were sympathetic to him, and it\u2019s really all the more remarkable when you consider that in the days and weeks since he left the hospital, the death toll from coronavirus in this country has continued to spiral upward. And as of a week ago or so, Britain now has the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe, and the second largest number of deaths of any country in the world, after the United States. And yet, even with that tragic human cost of this virus, Boris Johnson and his government retain the support of something like 51 percent , 52 percent of the people who approve of the way that they\u2019ve handled this virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mark, where are we right now in Britain? I mean, we\u2019re watching the world \u2014 Europe in particular \u2014 start to figure out what reopening is supposed to look like. Given this up-and-down history that you just recounted, what are you seeing that look like in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, so Britain is facing this increasing pressure to restart its economy, to ease the lockdown, to try to bring society back to some level of normalcy. And you\u2019re beginning to see the Italians, the Spanish, the Germans lift their lockdown. Britain reaches that same moment, and Boris Johnson announces he\u2019s going to give a speech to the nation in which he\u2019s going to lay out a roadmap. And there\u2019s a tremendous burst of hope that we are at the end of this difficult period. Some of the tabloids talk about the end of the lockdown, and the happy days that lie ahead. And so on Sunday night \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2014 your freedom.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson does appear and he delivers this fairly detailed speech.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) So I want to provide, tonight, for you, the shape of a plan, both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a roadmap for reopening society.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe lays out all sorts of benchmarks and criterias.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance, those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. In step two, at the earliest, by June the first, after half term, we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut when you actually go back and read his words \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And step three, at the earliest by July, and subject to all these conditions and further the scientific advice \u2014 if and only if the numbers support it \u2014 we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they\u2019re safe and enforce social distancing.\n\nmark landler\n\nReally, nothing much has changed. He\u2019s given a very dramatic speech in which he has barely budged the policy.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And so, no. This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. So his speech about reopening is really about how Britain is not about to truly reopen.\n\nmark landler\n\nYes. This turns out to be a speech that, when you really analyze it, is about why we are going to continue to live under a lockdown \u2014 one that might be tweaked at the edges here and there, there might be slight shifts \u2014 but fundamentally, nothing is changing in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s kind of remarkable how everything is flipped. Meantime, neighboring, more progressive countries like Germany, which took the virus so seriously from the beginning, are now announcing relatively aggressive reopening plans, and here we have Britain taking this far more cautious approach. It all seems quite scrambled, and I wonder what you make of that.\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, it\u2019s interesting. Every country had to make a choice about how to deal with something that is fundamentally so mysterious and so unpredictable. And the choices these countries made played out in ways that were either fortunate and successful, or tragic and largely unsuccessful. And that in turn has very much driven the way that these countries have dealt with this moment \u2014 the moment where they lift the lockdown. And so you have in Germany a country that, as you say, took the threat extremely seriously at the beginning, was very conservative, was very cautious, went to a lockdown, took the science of it extremely seriously. In Germany, the caution paid off. The death tolls stayed low. And now, as we come to this moment of lifting the lockdown, the Germans have the confidence to be brave, to take some risks, to lift elements of the lockdown, even at the risk of kicking up the infection rate. And conversely, here in England, where they came into this crisis with such an air of self-confidence, they\u2019ve now been rattled to their core. They\u2019ve really had their confidence shaken. And far from being brave or bold at this moment, they\u2019re now the country that\u2019s reacting with extreme caution. This libertarian country is now ready to keep the heavy hand of government in place, as long as it takes. And so you really see a role reversal that reflects how this virus has struck different countries, how the experiences that they\u2019ve undergone have been so starkly different. And as a result, how they\u2019re going to emerge from this period is sometimes extremely unexpected. And in Britain, it\u2019s been perhaps the most unexpected of all. The country that took this pandemic the least seriously is arguably going to now take it more seriously than anybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, thank you very much.\n\nmark landler\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Monday, countries across the world took some of their biggest steps yet toward easing restrictions on their citizens\u2019 movements. Spain began permitting small gatherings of up to 10 people, and for small shops to reopen. France allowed residents to leave their homes without filling out release forms for the first time in eight weeks.\n\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Russia announced the end of nationwide stay at home restrictions, despite a recent rise in infections. And \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If you look at all of those people over there, every one of them, from what I see, these are White House staffers, they\u2019re White House representatives, they\u2019re White House executives, and everybody has a mask on.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Nothing so well illustrates Wall Street\u2019s dangerously exuberant state of mind as its triple-digit rally in the wake of Larry Summers withdrawing from consideration to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nDo you really believe the outlook for corporate earnings suddenly became much brighter just because Summers is no longer in the running to succeed Ben Bernanke?\n\nIf so, I have a bridge I want to sell you.\n\nWall Street is now fully ensconced in that alternate reality in which all news is interpreted as a reason to rally. It\u2019s nice while it lasts, but it probably won\u2019t end well.\n\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It\u2019s more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\n\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. Their average recommended equity exposure right now stands at 56.6%, according to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI). That\u2019s 45 percentage points higher than the exposure level that prevailed just 12 trading sessions ago, in late August.\n\nThat\u2019s an awfully quick jump back on the bullish bandwagon by the typical market timer. In fact, the HSNSI is now higher than where it stood at the market\u2019s all-time high in early August \u2014 right before the stock market\u2019s August pullback (see chart).\n\nThis is a textbook illustration of what happens when Wall Street adopts a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d attitude.\n\nFormer Lehman employees rock out\n\nIf the market really thought it would be so awful if Larry Summers were Fed chairman, then it should have fallen as it looked increasingly likely that he would be appointed. That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle. Will it be paralysis in Washington over the debt ceiling that causes them to become less exuberant? A worsening of the Syria mess? Most likely, it will be something that comes out of left field that isn\u2019t even on our radar right now.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that, when that souring does happen, the market\u2019s lofty level will not be receiving much support from the fundamentals.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/ayrWz1FSrQE/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-12T19:28:34", "title": "Picking a perfect dividend portfolio", "text": "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +1.41% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nHidden gems from the '70s\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nThink before you grab those Ivy hunks\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +0.25% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, -0.94% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -0.36% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, -1.35% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +0.15% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, +1.07% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, -0.11% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -1.00% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +2.35% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +0.43% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +2.15% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, +2.36% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, -1.91% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-01T11:01:19", "title": "Car companies stuck in slow lane", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will \u201cmelt up\u201d as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\n\nI suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn\u2019t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks \u2014 or that they are about to increase that share.\n\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n\nPaper or plastic? Dollar bills, that is!\n\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash \u2014 the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history \u2014 occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors\u2019 opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, \u201cMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, \u201cSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months \u2014 and do just the reverse in summer.\n\nAs followers of the famous \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what\u2019s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn\u2019t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says \u2014 especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: \u201cFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-06T12:30:38", "title": "Insiders now aggressively bearish", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nMutual funds take big bite of Apple\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T12:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.39% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nWhy Dow may hit 15,000 in 2013\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T12:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Facebook Inc.\u2019s revenue is growing at a fast pace. But it isn\u2019t growing fast enough to support the social network\u2019s current stock price.\n\nFacebook FB, +1.96% released its latest quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday \u2014 reporting quarterly revenue of $1.59 billion. That brought revenue for all of last year to $5.1 billion. See: Facebook\u2019s results beat estimates\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, for sure, and certainly seems impressive.\n\nTo understand why I nevertheless believe that it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s helpful to review a back-of-the-envelope calculation of Facebook\u2019s valuation that I introduced in a column immediately after the company went public last May at $38 per share. Follow full coverage of Facebook\u2019s quarterly results and conference call.\n\nDoes Facebook have its mojo back?\n\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\n\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 \u2014 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\n\nFacebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in five years\u2019 time. I assumed it would be the same as Google\u2019s is today GOOG, +1.25% \u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s.\n\n\u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s. The rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market\u2019s long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty Images\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T16:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(Read blog post on the more than 5,000 mutual funds and ETFs that own Apple shares.)\n\nHowever, now that the stock is down nearly 40% since its peak of last September \u2014 including a more than 12% drop in Thursday\u2019s trading alone \u2014 perhaps they will be more open to considering the contrarian wisdom of investing in out-of-favor companies.\n\nThe stocks of such companies may be less exciting, but over the long term they usually provide a superior \u2014 and certainly less volatile \u2014 return.\n\nJust consider a spectacular bet that Robert Arnott, chairman and founder of Research Affiliates, made in the summer of 2010. To set the context of his bet, Apple that summer surpassed Microsoft MSFT, +1.45% to take the No. 2 spot in the market-cap rankings \u2014 and was fast closing in on ExxonMobil XOM, -0.70% as the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAs contrarian investors know, sometimes you need to kiss a frog to find your prince. Reuters\n\nBP BP, -1.44% , in contrast, was on life support as it struggled to cope with the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its stock price had plunged to its lowest in over a decade. Survival was by no means assured.\n\nLike the good contrarian he is, however, Arnott was willing to \u201ckiss the frog\u201d: He publicly bet that BP would outperform Apple over the longer term.\n\nThat was a gutsy bet indeed. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the vitriolic comments my column received for merely reporting Arnott\u2019s bet. Read August 2010 column in Barron\u2019s by Mark Hulbert: Is Apple\u2019s market value too big for comfort?\n\nTo be sure, Arnott\u2019s bet only recently became a winner. But he is today enjoying the last laugh: Since BP\u2019s low in the summer of 2010, it has produced a cumulative real return of 77%, in contrast to 71% for Apple.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time Arnott has kissed a frog. Another came a year after his BP-over-AAPL bet: In August 2011 he predicted that Bank of America BAC, -1.24% would outperform Apple over the long term.\n\nAt that time, it was hard to imagine Bank of America\u2019s reputation being more awful. It represented all that was dysfunctuional about bank and mortgage-company behavior that led to the credit crunch and liquidity crisis of 2008.\n\nEven today it is paying the price for its bad deeds: Its latest quarterly earnings, released last week, were hugely depressed by billions in charges related to the settlement of various legal disputes arising out of the subprime-mortgage fiasco. Read full report on BAC earnings.\n\nIs Apple a value investor's dream?\n\nYet on this BAC-over AAPL bet, Arnott is even further in the black than he is with his BP bet: Since my August 2011 column reporting it, Bank of America stock has produced an 18-month real return of 60%, versus 25% for Apple.\n\nTo be sure, contrarian bets like Arnott\u2019s don\u2019t always work out this nicely. But, more often than not, they do.\n\nWe know this because of the superior long-term performance of benchmarks like Arnott\u2019s so-called fundamental indices, which almost always end up underweighting the stocks with the largest market caps.\n\nConsider the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index, which weights stocks according to a number of fundamental criteria rather than market cap. In the summer of 2010, for example, when Arnott made his BP-over-AAPL bet, Apple was the 27th largest company in that index. It would have been the second-largest company in the index if its weight had been based on market cap.\n\nSince the inception of the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index in November 2005, its alternate weighting scheme has added 1.44 percentage points per year to its return. That\u2019s a lot of alpha to trace to changing each stock\u2019s weight in the index.\n\nKeep that in mind the next time you\u2019re tempted to invest in the latest fad on Wall Street.\n\nWhat frog might a contrarian be kissing right now?\n\nIn an email earlier this week, Chris Brightman, head of investment management at Research Affiliates, suggested betting on Wal-Mart WMT, +2.04% over Amazon AMZN, +0.87% . The latter company may not have the same pizzazz that Apple did in its heyday, but it still represents the allure and promise of the high-tech sector \u2014 especially in contrast to Wal-Mart.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 50% over the last year, triple Wal-Mart\u2019s stock gain of just 17%.\n\nBrightman\u2019s contrarian-based reasoning: \u201cToday, Amazon has a market capitalization of $124 billion, more than half of Wal-Mart\u2019s $233 billion market cap. Yet Wal-Mart is more than five times the size of Amazon measured by sales, cash flow, dividends, and book value. Wal-Mart has free cash flow ... of $11 billion per year to distribute to its shareholders \u2014 which is paid as $5 billion in dividends and $6 billion as share buybacks \u2014 providing a nearly 5% annual yield.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon [in contrast] has only $2 billion of free cash flow and pays nothing back to its shareholders. Amazon\u2019s sales and cash flow will need to more than quintuple relative to Wal-Mart to match Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to pay its shareholders. Anything less, and Wal-Mart is the better investment.\u201d\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}]}, "marketwatch_stories": {"rss": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/newsviewer/", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7BC31DEC60-955F-11EA-A1C7-E090B731C98D%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-16T18:47:09", "title": "What\u2019s happened to value stocks?", "text": "If you\u2019re an active value investor, or you\u2019re just holding retirement money in a \u201cvalue\u201d stock mutual fund, well\u2026. It sucks.\n\nYou\u2019ve lost about a fifth of your money so far this year, while competing \u201cgrowth\u201d funds are nearly even stevens. The market losses of 2020 are almost all on the \u201cvalue\u201d side of the ledger. Big headline growth stocks, like Amazon AMZN, +0.87% , Facebook FB, +1.96% , Netflix NFLX, +2.77% and Google GOOG, +1.25% , are either hitting new highs or nearing them.\n\nAnd that adds insults to a lot of injury. Value investing has been lagging growth investing since the financial crisis of 2008-9.\n\nLast decade the index of S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% growth stocks VUG, +0.87% beat its value VTV, -0.02% by about 70 full percentage points in total. Ouch.\n\nValue investing is now so out of fashion that Charles de Vaulx, one of the best value investors around, has opened his funds again to new clients. When he launched IVA Worldwide IVWAX, -0.07% and IVA International IVIOX, at the end of 2008 he was fighting them off with a stick.\n\nValue and Growth investing are the Montague and Capulets of the stock market. Value investors\u2014to oversimplify \u2014 like to buy things that are certain. They buy stocks that are cheap compared with today\u2019s fundamentals: Current cash value, present asset values, current dividends. Where possible they like to buy stocks that are so cheap that things can even go wrong and they\u2019ll get their money back in the end.\n\nThat typically means investing in boring but established companies.\n\nGrowth investors, on the other hand, are willing to gamble on the uncertainties of the future. They buy what they hope will be the companies of tomorrow, and the day after tomorrow. And they\u2019re willing to pay high\u2014sometimes sky high\u2014prices for the privilege.\n\nYou might reasonably argue that companies such as Amazon and Netflix are the companies of today as well as tomorrow, and have terrific fundamentals. But the risk \u201cgrowth\u201d investors take is that they pay a lot extra for that growth.\n\nAmazon stock currently sells for 112 times last year\u2019s per-share earnings: You\u2019re paying $112 for each dollar of after-tax profit the company made last year. So someone buying Amazon stock here isn\u2019t just betting that Amazon will be great today but that it will be even greater tomorrow.\n\nMeanwhile Verizon Communications VZ, -0.36% , one of the top \u201cvalue\u201d stocks in the market, sells for just 12 times last year\u2019s earnings, or barely one-tenth as much. Someone buying Verizon isn\u2019t taking a big gamble on future growth. They\u2019re happy with what they own right now. Verizon stock currently pays a 4.5% dividend yield.\n\nThe divide between value and growth is an old one. Benjamin Graham is generally thought of as the father of value investing: He got hosed in the crash of \u201929, and thereafter made it a rule only to buy stocks that were so cheap compared with fundamentals he had a wide \u201cmargin of safety\u201d in case things went wrong.\n\nPhilip Fisher, author of the 1950s classic Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits, is among the most famous apostles of growth investing. He argued that the key to making big money was to find great long-term growth companies, buy them and then pretty much hang on forever.\n\nWho is right? Well, both, presumably. It just depends on how much you pay for the stocks. Warren Buffett, notably, says he\u2019s been influenced by both Graham and Fisher (Although his investment company, Berkshire Hathaway BRK.B, -0.98% , is now a big component of the U.S. \u201cvalue\u201d index.)\n\nThe dismal performance of so-called \u201cvalue\u201d since the financial crisis has produced a new wave of soul-searching among investors and academics.\n\nFinance professors Eugene Fama and Kenneth French, who argued for a long time that value stocks tend to outperform the market over time, recently conceded that value\u2019s long-term superiority seems to have faded dramatically.\n\nBig value stocks beat the overall market index by an average of 0.36 percentage points a month from 1963 to 1991, they calculate. (That works out an average of about 4.4% a year).\n\nBut since 1991 that\u2019s collapsed to just 0.05 percentage points a month, they say. (That\u2019s about 0.6% a year). \u201cWe don\u2019t reject the hypothesis that out-of-sample expected monthly premiums are zero,\u201d which is how financial professors say that in future, value investing may get you bupkis.\n\nThe number crunchers at the Greenwich, Conn., global investment management firm AQR aren\u2019t so sure. They suspect value remains a viable investment strategy, although they think investors need to calculate \u201cvalue\u201d in more sophisticated ways in the way.\n\n\u201cWe think the medium-term odds are now, rather dramatically, on the side of value,\u201d writes AQR honcho Cliff Asness in a blog post. \u201cIt has certainly been excruciating getting here, but here we are, and it\u2019s never looked cheaper looking forward.\u201d\n\nValue\u2019s recent woes are nothing new, writes David Blitz, the head of Quantitative Research at money manager Robeco. For value investors the decade just past looks much like the 1990s\u2014another \u201clost decade\u201d when they were desperately out of fashion. That was followed by a period when the market swung away from growth and back to value.\n\nThe chart above is drawn from data published by MSCI, the market information company. It compares the total returns of the U.S. \u201cvalue\u201d and \u201cgrowth\u201d indexes during various periods since it began calculating them at the end of 1974. The returns are in so-called \u201creal\u201d terms, meaning they\u2019ve been adjusted to take account of general price inflation.\n\nMaybe this is data mining, but it looks there have been four clear regimes or periods over that time. For 14 years value beat growth into a cocked hat. For the next 11 years it was growth\u2019s turn. During the dismal years on the U.S. market from 2000 to 2006, value stocks eked out a small profit, while growth stocks lost nearly half their real value. And since the end of 2006, growth stocks have boomed again.\n\nWhat causes these changes? Nobody really knows. Fashion? Changing macroeconomic environments? Interest rates? New technology? Sunspots?\n\nMaybe it\u2019s just price. In early 2000, at the peak of the growth mania, big tech favorite Cisco CSCO, +0.95% was trading for 150 times last year\u2019s earnings. Many established, old-fashioned value companies were trading at less than 10 times earnings. Some reached as low as five times last year\u2019s earnings with dividend yields of 10%. Sheer madness.\n\nNo one can be certain if the tide will turn, and if so, when. But the massive relative outperformance of growth over the past year and a half or so looks eerily similar to that in 1998-9.\n\n\u201cGrowth\u2019s outperformance will end when it finally crumbles under its own weight, as it finally did in 2000, but I have no idea if it happens next week or in five years,\u201d says veteran value investor Josh Strauss of money manager Pekin Hardy Strauss.

(Before Coronavirus), President Donald Trump told us \u201cour economy is the best it has ever been.\u201d That line came in his Feb. 4 State of the Union address, in which he mentioned \u201cjobs\u201d 10 times and how great everything was.\n\n\u201cJobs are booming,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cWe have created seven million new jobs.\u201d\n\n\u201cLast year, women filled 72% of all new jobs added.\u201d\n\nAnd so on.\n\nLots of lousy jobs\n\nBut the underlying reality was never as lustrous as we were led to believe. In sheer numbers, job growth had indeed been solid for a decade \u2014 here is the month-by-month data going back 10 years\u2014 yet this obscured the fact that tens of millions of these jobs weren\u2019t very good to begin with.\n\nLast November, before anyone had heard of the coronavirus, a Brookings Institution study found that \u201c53 million Americans between the ages of 18 to 64 \u2014 accounting for 44% of all workers \u2014 qualify as \u2018low-wage.\u2019 Their median hourly wages are $10.22, and median annual earnings are about $18,000.\u201d Median means that half of these jobs \u2014 half \u2014 paid even less than that.\n\nRelated story: Coronavirus layoffs hitting the poorest hardest, Fed study says\n\nFurther evidence of this squalor is provided by Cornell University\u2019s private sector job quality Index (JQI), which \u201cassesses job quality in the United States by measuring desirable higher-wage/higher-hour jobs versus lower-wage/lower-hour jobs.\u201d It focuses on workers that are engaged in production and non-supervisory jobs \u2014 a universe of about 100 million workers, roughly 62% of the U.S. workforce.\n\n\u201cWhat you see from 1990 to just before the COVID crisis,\u201d says economist Jeffrey Ferry, one of the JQI\u2019s researchers, \u201cis that the U.S. created millions of jobs. But when you look at the quality of those jobs, you see a persistent shift towards lower-paying jobs.\u201d\n\nBipartisan failure\n\nIn fairness to President Trump, since we\u2019re talking about the bulk of the gargantuan U.S. labor force here, it\u2019s reasonable to say that this isn\u2019t so much a Trump problem as it is a long-term secular decline in job quality that spans both Republican and Democratic administrations, and Republican and Democratic-dominated Congresses.\n\nBoth parties always pay lip service to creating good-paying jobs, but based on this data, it\u2019s obvious that neither has done a very good job of doing so.\n\nAgain, all of this describes our situation pre-pandemic. It was bad then, and worse now. If there\u2019s a silver lining to be found today, I believe it is this: This terrible virus has swept away illusions, and whatever degree of false confidence and complacency we may have had just a few weeks ago.\n\nWhen President Trump crowed about \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs,\u201d he nailed it \u2014 because millions of Americans had to work several \u201cjobs jobs jobs\u201d just to keep afloat. For 33 million, God help them if they got sick, because their employer sure wouldn\u2019t: That\u2019s the number of workers in this country who, the Labor Department says, lacked paid sick leave. But now those \u201cjobs, jobs, jobs\u201d are gone.\n\nAnd when unemployment fell to 3.5% last year, we heard it was the \u201clowest since 1969.\u201d Statistically, that was true, but the implication that it meant security and prosperity? Nothing but an illusion.\n\nMissing pensions, health insurance\n\nWhen unemployment hit 3.5% in 1969\u2014the year we first landed on the moon\u2014the vast majority of Americans working in the private sector had a defined pension plan. Today, only about 15% do. Anyone who believes that Americans are more secure and better off than 1969, well, then perhaps you believe that the moon is made of green cheese.\n\nEven before the pandemic the number of Americans who were losing health insurance was growing by the millions. Even before this pandemic, one in nine American households were \u201cfood insecure,\u201d including one in seven children.\n\nEven before this pandemic, nearly half of American households over the age of 55 had no retirement savings. Golden years? I don\u2019t think so.\n\nIf the 20th Century was the American Century, the 21st \u2014 now one-fifth in the rear-view mirror \u2014 has been anything but. Two wars, two devastating recessions. A wealth gap, race gap, education gap.\n\nWe can\u2019t agree on basic facts and we keep sending politicians to Washington who can barely speak with each other, let alone fix our growing problems. This is our fault: We\u2019re the ones who elect them.\n\nThis is a clarifying moment.

He said he could see Okta following Twitter\u2019s path \u201cuntil there is a vaccine or a treatment.\u201d\n\nAs small businesses and nonessential services slowly begin to reopen, tech CEOs like Butterfield and McKinnon OKTA, +2.41% are in internal discussions about fundamental changes to their workforces with far-reaching social implications. Not only are they open to letting a majority of employees work remotely; they\u2019re vastly scaling back travel and attendance at conferences, hiring talent from all parts of the country, reducing office space and using the office as a place to socialize as much as work.\n\nThe financial impact on cities like San Francisco and Seattle, where tech is the chief economic engine, could be devastating. Use of commercial real estate and public transit are likely to decline. Restaurants, bars and other gathering spots could be endangered. And then there is the toll on workers, many of whom feel increasingly isolated and stressed, worried about the security of their jobs even as they log long shifts at home.\n\nBut that is the collateral damage from a new workforce that could also save companies billions of dollars in operational costs; greatly reduce traffic and liability related to sick employees; and enhance productivity from a workforce that eats, sleeps and lives at its diffuse, de facto offices. Tech is uniquely positioned to take advantage of working conditions turned upside down and sideways because it has the technical resources to support a decentralized workforce, and a significant slice of its employees already worked remotely.\n\nIn a free-wheeling \u201cvirtual dinner\u201d this week attended by five software CEOs \u2014 McKinnon, Box Inc.\u2019s BOX, +1.05% Aaron Levie, PagerDuty Inc.\u2019s PD, +1.78% Jennifer Tejada, Twilio Inc.\u2019s TWLO, -1.37% Jeff Lawson and Zuora Inc.\u2019s ZUO, +2.71% Tien Tzuo \u2014 the topic elicited the most animated conversation.\n\nSee also: Twitter employees can work from home as long as they wish\n\n\u201cTwitter will cause a snowball of other organizations going forward,\u201d said Levie, who has weaned on the management style of former Intel Corp. INTC, -1.35% CEO Andy Grove, who weaved through offices to get an up-close look at workers. \u201cWe may not go back to work the same way [at Box]. Things are faster, more action-oriented with remote workers. With videoconferencing, I can check in on customers in the U.S., Japan and Europe in one day.\u201d\n\n\u201cOur salespeople meet five to eight customers a day now [via videoconferencing] versus the one it took them three days [to see in the past] because of travel,\u201d he added.\n\nA major reason for improved productivity is that people have had little else to do during the shelter-at-home directive and felt pressure to produce to retain their jobs, countered Shane Metcalf, chief culture officer at 15Five, an enterprise technology company.\n\n\u201cOne of the shadow side effects is that employees are working longer hours, and feel as if they\u2019re always on call,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are stressed.\u201d\n\nSee also: Cisco profit continues to flow amid pandemic despite revenue slowdown\n\nTo be sure, not everyone will follow Twitter\u2019s lead. Some, like Apple Inc. AAPL, -0.59% , Nvidia Corp. NVDA, +5.73% and Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.87% , have devoted billions of dollars to sparkling new facilities that will always house thousands of employees. And some people want to return to an office, pointed out PagerDuty\u2019s Tejada.\n\nAdded Butterfield: \u201cSome employees are going insane [because they] are cooped up alone in an apartment or have kids and want to go back to work. The majority want to be in the office.\u201d\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t believe that \u2018office-less globally\u2019 is in our company\u2019s best interest to build strong company culture or long-term productivity. Like most things in life, the best answer is typically something that moderates between two extremes,\u201d Vonage Holdings Corp. VG, +3.04% CEO Alan Masarek told MarketWatch via email. None of the company\u2019s 2,400 employees will be required to come back to the office \u201cuntil they are comfortable doing so.\u201d\n\nRecord traffic usage of Zoom, Microsoft Corp.\u2019s MSFT, +1.45% Teams, Slack Technologies Inc.\u2019s WORK, -1.04% enterprise messaging, Cisco Systems Inc.\u2019s CSCO, +0.95% Webex and other services underscores the always-on workplace.\n\n\u201cSome elements of this work-from-home scenario will not go away,\u201d Cisco CEO Chuck Robbins said during a conference call with analysts Wednesday following the company\u2019s quarterly earnings announcement. For example, Webex hosted more than 20 billion meeting minutes in April, compared with 14 billion in March and 7 billion in February.\n\n\u201cThe pandemic has created a permanent shift in the way people are working, and while not every organization will go 100% work from home forever, there will certainly be more support for virtualized environments,\u201d Masarek said.\n\nOne company going all-in virtually is Dialpad because, quite simply, it can. CEO Craig Walker, who helped develop Google Voice technology, was leaning that way before the pandemic forced most of the economy to shut down. He wants the communications-software firm\u2019s 400 employees to work from home four or five days a week, he said, and he plans to halve office space to accommodate a staggered work schedule.\n\nNo matter what path companies take, they agree it will not be the same. Some employees will exclusively work from home, while others will opt for the office. And others may do both.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s back to a whole new way of work \u2014 like back to the future,\u201d says Quick Base CEO Ed Jennings, who took over the $1 billion, 500-person company this week, but has yet to visit headquarters.\n\nStill, he\u2019s already re-imagining what it will look like in the future \u2014 with more open space, partitions and collaboration spaces.\n\n\u201cIt is hard to create depth of relationship when you communicate strictly via virtual meeting,\u201d Jennings said. \u201cEmployees say these days they get things done so much faster at home.

Is it too late to qualify for the first stimulus payment? If so, what was the cut off date for filing your taxes?\n\nShantae\n\nDear Moneyist #2,\n\nI didn\u2019t file my 2018 taxes because I had to collect all my tax documents (which were misplaced when we moved). I did file my 2019 taxes in March, but my stimulus check is still showing as \u201cprocessing.\u201d Will I still get my stimulus check this year once the Internal Revenue Service has finished processing my 2019 taxes?\n\nJennifer\n\nDear Moneyist #3,\n\nI receive Social Security. It is my only income, so I did not file tax returns. I get my monthly payment via direct deposit. I have had the same bank-account information for 15 years. Yet I have not received my CARES Act benefit.\n\nEveryone I know has gotten their payment, including those on Social Security. I even know people who have received paper checks. I have never been able to access the IRS tool. It always says, \u201cNo information available.\u201d There doesn\u2019t seem to be any way to get help from either the IRS or SSA.\n\nWhere is my check?\n\nSandra\n\nDear Moneyist #4,\n\nI didn\u2019t file taxes for 2018 and I did it for the first time on April 6 for 2019. So far I haven\u2019t received my stimulus check. Do you think this happened because I filed my taxes too late? I meet all the requirements from the IRS.\n\nKimberly\n\nDear Moneyist #5,\n\nI filed my 2018 taxes two days ago, and I have yet to file my 2019 taxes. Is it too late to receive a stimulus check?\n\nN.C.\n\nDear Late Filers,\n\nFirst off, you need to make sure you qualify. The IRS is sending $1,200 to individuals with an annual adjusted gross income below $75,000 and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000, plus $500 per qualifying child.\n\nThe stimulus check is an advance payment of a refundable credit on your 2020 return, so the IRS will take into account 2018 tax returns, if you have not filed your 2019 return yet. If you have not filed your 2018 return, it\u2019s not too late to file now. You may, however, face a late-payment fee.\n\nThe agency has said it will continue to process stimulus checks throughout 2020 and, to help people, it has extended the deadline for people filing their 2019 income taxes from April 15 to July 15. More than 130 million stimulus checks have been cut thus far.\n\nHigh Noon last Wednesday was the deadline for Americans to submit their direct-deposit information to the Internal Revenue Service, the IRS said. Checks mailed out after Wednesday\u2019s deadline would arrive by late May at the earliest.\n\nDispatches from a pandemic:Letter from New York: \u2018New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags. When I hear an ambulance, I wonder if there\u2019s a coronavirus patient inside. Are there more 911 calls, or do I notice every distant siren?\u2019\n\nThose collecting Social Security and who are not working do not have to file a tax return. The IRS will have those details on file. People who are receiving checks by direct deposit will more than likely receive their payments before those getting paper checks through the mail.\n\nObviously, this is another reminder to stay current with your taxes to avoid fees and any other legal issues that may occur further down the line. It\u2019s unlikely the IRS will have the manpower to audit people who have not filed, but no one wants the IRS on their case.\n\nPeople working at state tax offices are working hard to process these payments. New jobless claims have topped 36 million in recent weeks due to the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. They are working hard to ensure that people get their stimulus money.\n\nThe Democratic-run House of Representatives approved a $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill on Friday night; analysts are saying it\u2019s likely that President Donald Trump will end up signing a new aid package into law next month or later following extensive negotiations.\n\nThe bottom line: If you do not receive your stimulus check this year, you will receive it next year.

Investors who employ an ESG strategy examine criteria such as environmental, social, and governance factors.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re demanding more from defensive companies in terms of cash flow and quality of the balance sheet, but also we\u2019re seeing technology stocks as a defensive play because tech products are now a staple purchase that people will carry on buying whatever,\u201d she said.\n\nIndeed, many software companies now provide services that are essential to businesses and consumers, where they were a luxury 10 or 15 years ago. The recent performance of some of the largest companies in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.39% in 2020, like Microsoft Corp. MSFT, +1.45% or Amazon.com Inc. AMZN, +0.87% are a testament to demand for services like cloud computing that have held up remarkably well during the sharp economic downturn.\n\nChesworth said that investors might do well to focus on factors including momentum, growth and quality, which have all performed well since the market bottom on March 23, given investor interest in companies that can grow earnings even in a poor economic environment and those with strong balance sheets.\n\nSince the market bottom March 23, the iShares Edge MSCI USA Quality Factor ETF QUAL, +0.75% has outperformed the S&P 500 by 2.1%, the iShares Edge MSCI USA Momentum Factor ETF MTUM, +1.19% has outperformed by 6.4% and the SPDR Portfolio S&P 500 Growth ETF SPYG, +0.66% has beaten the broad index by 4.1%.\n\nMeanwhile, even though companies in the utilities, consumer and real estate sectors still dominate lists of the highest-yielding dividend stocks, a growing number of firms in the technology and communication services sectors have rocketed up those lists, as these companies have become mature, steady producers of cash.\n\nOver the past ten years, the two highest yielding dividend stocks have been CenturyLink Inc. CTL, +0.87% and AT&T Inc. T, -0.94% , both housed in the communication services sector. Altria Group Inc. MO, +0.93% and Philip Morris International Inc. PM, -0.26% are the only consumer staples stocks that rank among the 40 highest yielding in the S&P 500 over that time.\n\nJulien Emmanuel, chief equity and derivatives strategist at BTIG told MarketWatch that the speed of the coronavirus stock-market crash, the government response, and subsequent recovery has also helped to create a unique environment for investors which can neither be described as a bear nor bull market.\n\n\u201cThe market was rescued by a truly staggering degree of stimulus and that plus the price action off the lows proves we\u2019re no longer in a bear market,\u201d he said. \u201cAt the same time the abject pessimism that we\u2019ve been hearing from clients about the uncertainty surrounding what the economy is going to look like, what the risks are, and the inability to answer the question of whether you\u2019re going to feel comfortable sending your kid to college this fall, or eating in a restaurant or flying in an airplane means it\u2019s not a bull market either.\u201d\n\nTherefore its no surprise to him that sectors are not behaving like they typically do during bear markets and that investors should approach the coronavirus recession as the unique event it is, one that has so far boosted the technology sector dominated by names that have benefitted as more Americans have worked, shopped and entertained themselves at home via Microsoft, Amazon and Netflix Inc. NFLX, +2.77%\n\nAnd while sectors like utilities and real estate have typically held up well during bear markets, benefitting from the slow decline in interest rates that make them appealing alternatives to bonds, the Federal Reserve was already lowering rates before the current crisis and cut them to zero in a matter of weeks after the COVID-19 pandemic hit the United States, blunting their appeal in today\u2019s market.\n\nSeveral analysts pointed to health care as one typically defensive sector that has performed well in recent weeks and will likely continue to do so as the economy finds its way to a more sustained recovery. \u201cWe view Heath Care as our favorite longer-term secular growth opportunity,\u201d wrote Lori Calvasina, head of U.S. equity strategy at RBC Capital Markets, in a Friday research note, pointing to attractive valuations, relatively small recent downward earnings revisions, and the potential for stocks in the sector to benefit from coronavirus treatments and vaccines.\n\nInvestors will have plenty of time to contemplate the impact of the coronavirus pandemic and the potential for a game-changing cure in the weeks ahead, now that first-quarter corporate earnings reporting season is largely in the rearview mirror. Still left to report, however, are many big-name retailers whose results may disappoint given recent data on April retail sales.\n\nChinese Internet giant Baidu Inc.

Callaghan O'Hare | Reuters\n\nCoronavirus cases are rising in Texas as the state plans more steps to restart its devastated economy during the pandemic. After new reported cases rose by about 1,000 per day in mid-April, they started to climb in May, reaching a new single-day high of about 1,450 on Thursday. While Texans moved more freely around the state after it allowed stores and restaurants to reopen on May 1 with capacity restrictions, the figures could reflect improving testing capacity. Cases are \"definitely increasing but it's not to the point where it's overwhelming our health care system,\" said Dr. Brian Reed, professor and chair of the department of clinical sciences at the University of Houston College of Medicine.\n\nWhen Texas partially rebooted its economy at the start of the month, it became the most populous state to do so up to that point. Along with the other largely Republican-led states that lifted restrictions designed to slow the pandemic in late April and early May, Texas looked to buoy a state economy wrecked after most businesses closed their doors. Texas will next allow businesses such as gyms to open on Monday with capacity limits.\n\nThe decision comes with immense risk. Experts say more freedom of movement leads to expectations of increased infections \u2014 though people's decisions to continue distancing and wear face coverings in public could limit the spread. This week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Congress that states could see \"little spikes that might turn into outbreaks\" if they restart their economies too soon.

Johannes Eisele | AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe prevailing mood in the markets right now is neither bullish nor bearish but rather befuddled. For investors, trying to gauge sentiment among other investors and traders is a constant undertaking, a way to sort out what bets are popular, which themes are played out and where lies the index direction that would cause the greatest surprise. Collecting all the readings together leads to a sense that the consensus is experiencing more confusion than conviction. And who can blame the crowd here. The S&P 500 experienced the fastest 30% drop from a record high in history, on a literally unprecedented intentional stoppage of most global commerce. From rarely seen panic levels and profoundly extreme oversold conditions, stocks snapped back in the fastest 35% rally in more than 80 years, regaining 60% of the decline but still without much support from improving real-time economic indicators.\n\nThe market has made a head-spinning round-trip, but in other ways has gone nowhere: The S&P has been sideways in a range for about a month near levels first reached in early 2018. About half of all large stocks are down more than 30% from their high, and yet in aggregate the S&P carries its highest valuation based on forecast one-year earnings since 2002. Those wishing to make a contrarian bullish case for stocks on the premise that most investors are too cautious can point to retail investor surveys and fund flows. The weekly American Association of Individual Investors poll last week showed bearish respondents numbered more than 50%, twice those saying they were bullish on stocks over the next six months. Bears have exceeded 50% for three of the last four weeks, quite unusual, especially when the S&P is pretty distant from its lows both in price and time. Source: AAII Investors pulled another $6 billion from equity funds in the latest week, according to fund tracker EPFR, taking the year-to-date net outflow to $40 billion. Meantime, an enormous $1.2 trillion has been moved out of risk assets and into money-market funds. This clearly shows longer-term public investors in a defensive posture.\n\nBut what about the pros?\n\nYet it's more a mixed picture when professional investors, tactical traders and market-based behavioral indicators are pulled into the frame. Strategists looking to make the case that the hot money has become a bit too greedy in the short term have cited a steep drop in the CBOE put/call ratio, which indicates declining demand for downside protection. While not at extreme lows \u2013 and this ratio popped higher during Thursday's choppy market sell-off \u2013 it certainly implies traders letting their guard down. Then there is the surge in new online-brokerage account openings among younger investors seizing on the big market drop, and those stuck at home and looking for action, described here last week. Many of the most popular stocks among clients of the beginner-focused investing app Robinhood are low-share-price name-brand stocks that have been hammered, along with speculative New Economy names such as Tesla. An influx of less-experienced investors is more a sign of frothiness than fearfulness, of course. And David Tepper, the billionaire investor and founder of Appaloosa Management, last week on CNBC noted \"pockets\" of excess in the market, including special-purpose acquisition vehicles (public companies that raise cash first and then search for a business to buy). Stocks that started this way include Virgin Galactic and DraftKings. Then there are the sentiment readings that are neutral, ambiguous or offsetting. The equity-exposure of the discretionary money managers in the National Association of Active Investment Management survey is around neutral, at 57% and in fact has receded from its rebound-rally highs.\n\nNational Association of Active Investment Management survey\n\nSource: NAAIM And the gauges constructed to capture risk appetites and investor positioning more broadly are in some disagreement.\n\nEuphoria?", "author": ["Michael Santoli"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/as-jc-penney-goes-bankrupt-some-question-if-it-should-emerge.html", "published": "2020-05-16T14:58:44", "title": "As JC Penney goes bankrupt, some question if it should continue to operate", "text": "Does the world of retail really need J.C. Penney?\n\nAs the department store chain filed for bankruptcy protection Friday evening, some question if the company still has a place in American retail. Or if it could ever bounce back from the fatal blow it has been dealt during the coronavirus pandemic, which forced its roughly 850 stores shut temporarily.\n\n\"You have this issue of the middle collapsing,\" said Steve Dennis, founder of retail group SageBerry Consulting and a Neiman Marcus strategy executive from 2004 to 2008. \"I think conceptually there is only a place for one department store in the mall.\"\n\nPenney, which was born in 1913 catering to farmers in rural America, built an iconic brand name for itself, serving as a staple shop in many homes, especially catering to women with families. But Walmart and Target grew, stealing market share outside of the mall. Then, the internet exploded, with Amazon at the helm. Penney was late to adapt and invest in its stores.\n\nThe Covid-19 crisis only exacerbated many of the challenges it was already facing, including an overhang of debt.\n\nPenney's annual net sales contracted 8.1% to $10.7 billion in 2019. That followed a 7.1% drop in 2018, a sales decline of 0.1% in 2017, and a drop of 0.4% in 2016, according to annual filings.\n\nSome thought Penney would reap the rewards of Sears' demise. Sears, another American retail icon, has been shuttering stores for years and filed for bankruptcy in October 2018. But still, Penney finds itself in a sales slump, battling TJ Maxx, Target, Macy's and others \u2014 in apparel, appliances and home goods.\n\n\"I don't think there is a place for J.C. Penney anymore,\" said Robin Lewis, founder and CEO of The Robin Report and a consultant to retail companies. \"Even if we didn't have this virus ... we have been over-stored for half a century in this country.\"\n\nThis past holiday season, sales online and at Penney stores open for at least 12 months were down 7.5%. Overall department store sales decreased 1.8% from Nov. 1 through Dec. 24, according to Mastercard Spending Pulse. The drop happened even as holiday retail sales overall grew 4.1%, the National Retail Federation said.\n\nAnd as retail sales tumbled 16.4% last month, their worst month-over-month drop ever recorded, department stores were down 28.9%, according to fresh data from the U.S. Census Bureau. Year-over-year, department store sales were down 47%, amounting to $6.1 billion, compared with $11.5 billion in April 2019.\n\nA look back in time shows just how much department stores' dominance in retail has waned.\n\nIn 1992, department store operators accounted for 14.3% of overall retail sales, excluding gas and car dealer sales, according to data from the Commerce Department. That share was a paltry 3.7% as of the end of last year.\n\nAmerica will emerge from the coronavirus pandemic with fewer department stores, as Nordstrom has already said it plans to close 16 of them. Additional closings by other chains are expected. But it could also mean entire companies, such as Penney, vanish.\n\n\"There's way too much space chasing too few dollars,\" Dennis said. \"Nobody can consistently make money.\"\n\nPenney said in its Chapter 11 filing that it has commitments for $900 million in financing from its existing first-lien lenders to fund its bankruptcy, which includes $450 million of new money. It had approximately $500 million in cash on hand as of the Chapter 11 filing date.\n\nPenney added that in bankruptcy proceedings it will \"reduce its store footprint\" in phases. It said it plans to disclose specific store details and timing in the coming weeks.\n\n\"Until this pandemic struck, we had made significant progress rebuilding our company,\" Chief Executive Jill Soltau said in a statement.\n\nAnother former department store executive sees a scenario where Penney dissolves \u2014 along with others including Lord & Taylor, Neiman Marcus and Dillard's \u2014 and only Macy's, Nordstrom and Kohl's are left standing.\n\n\"They are just like Sears, there is no path forward,\" Jan Kniffen, a consultant to investors in retail companies and a former executive at The May Department Stores, parts of which were folded into Macy's, said about Penney. \"I think a lot of stores will reopen long enough to go broke again.\"\n\nCNBC previously reported that Penney has been working on a plan that would contemplate closing 180 to 200 stores while in bankruptcy.\n\nPenney is not alone in this scenario, either.\n\nHigh-end department store chain Neiman Marcus, the rural chain Stage Stores and apparel maker J.Crew have each filed for bankruptcy protection during the pandemic. Stage plans to liquidate its more than 700 stores if it can't find a buyer. It operates under brand names such as Gordmans, Bealls and Goody's.\n\nHome-goods company Pier 1 Imports and sporting-goods retailer Modell's had filed for Chapter 11 protection before the Covid-19 virus slammed the U.S. economy and forced nonessential retailers' stores shut, subsequently putting their going-out-of-business sales on hold. Modell's has been in the process of liquidating its entire store base. Pier 1 was planning to emerge with a smaller footprint.\n\n\"Anything that has any chance of working would take many years and a lot of investment,\" Dennis said. \"In these bankruptcies, I think a lot of them aren't going to make it because investors are saying ... this is too much of a long shot.\"\n\n\u2014CNBC's Lauren Hirsch contributed to this reporting.", "author": ["Lauren Thomas"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/coronavirus-live-updates-us-house-passes-historic-relief-package.html", "published": "2020-05-16T18:15:58", "title": "Coronavirus live updates: Grocery shopping is evolving; NY race tracks reopening", "text": "As states continue to test various reopening strategies, the efforts range from crowded, mask-free bars in Wisconsin to curbside retail deliveries in New Jersey.

Whether it's sneeze-shields and contactless payment at cashier stations or more online shopping and increased purchases of locally sourced goods, how we stock our refrigerators, freezers and pantries looks a lot different than it did just a few months ago. Food shopping stands ready to change even more, as grocers turn to ever more contact-free automation to get jobs done. Robots are restocking shelves and patrolling store aisles, for example, while newfangled \"dark stores\" are open only for pick-up of online orders. Some of the changes may fade as the coronavirus does, but others will remain. CNBC's Melissa Repko talks to those in the know. \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nA grocery store worker wears a mask while working in the meat department of a grocery store as the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in the Brooklyn borough of New York U.S., May 5, 2020. Lucas Jackson | Reuters\n\nNew York enters early stages of contact tracing\n\n12:48 pm ET \u2014 New York's contact tracing program is now underway with hundreds of tracers in the state's regions that have begun reopening. \"Those five regions that reopened \u2014 they had to have a certain number of tracers in proportion to their population,\" New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said at a press briefing Saturday. Contact tracers are required to complete a multi-hour training from Johns Hopkins University. The Cuomo administration wants the contact tracing program to provide important information regarding how the virus is spread, especially regarding at-home transmission. \u2014 Hannah Miller\n\nKroger to provide \"thank you\" bonuses after ending hazard pay\n\n12:30 pm ET \u2014 Kroger said it will give $130 million in new \"thank you\" bonuses to store workers through mid-June, The Cincinnati Enquirer reports. The one-time payments will be provided in two installments on May 30 and June 18, according to the report. Eligible full-time workers will receive $400 in total, while part-time employees will receive $200. The grocery retailer's announcement comes days after it said it was ending hazard pay for employees, a decision that garnered criticism from Kroger's union. \u2014 Hannah Miller\n\nNY reopening horse racing tracks\n\n12: 25 pm ET \u2014 New York is opening up horse racing tracks and the Watkins Glen International racetrack without spectators as of June 1, Gov. Andrew Cuomo said Saturday. The state will issue guidance in the upcoming weeks on how the tracks will open safely to avoid the spread of the virus. The reopening is the latest piece of guidance from the governor allowing economic activity to restart without public gatherings. \"You want to increase economic activity as much as you can without spiking the infection rate,\" Cuomo said at a press conference. \u2014 Emma Newburger\n\nJury's still out on summer camps\n\n12:20 pm ET \u2014 The Centers for Disease Control said Thursday that summer camps for kids should not reopen without coronavirus screening and control protocols, but at least one health expert says some types of camps could help contain the spread of Covid-19. Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb says that he'd send his kids to a sleepaway camp because \"have the potential to create a protective bubble that is easier to do than at day camps,\" where kids and workers come and go. Others disagree. Helene Drobenare, a social worker and the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camps in New York, says \"nowhere in the world could give that coverage\" amid a pandemic. CNBC's Barbara Booth looks at what experts are saying and camp directors are doing as the summer camping season kicks off. \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nCases in Texas rise as state continues reopening progress\n\n11:35 am ET \u2014 Texas has seen an uptick in coronavirus cases as it continues its reopening efforts. Back in mid-April, cases rose by about 1,000 per day, but started to increase at a faster pace in May, reaching a new single-day high of about 1,450 on Thursday, CNBC's Jacob Pramuk and John W. Schoen report. Texas started lifting major restrictions on May 1 when it allowed stores and restaurants to reopen with capacity limitations. \u2014 Hannah Miller\n\nOp-Ed: Amazon needs to come clean about its infection statistics\n\n11: 15 am ET \u2014 It's past time for Amazon to disclose the number of its employees who have been infected or killed by coronavirus, and declining to share that information disrespects the very workers who are putting their lives on the line to keep the retail giant's warehouses running, CNBC's Steve Kovach writes in a new op-ed. At least seven Amazon employees have died from Covid-19. Today, Amazon should make its workforce's infection and death data public and allow its employees to make informed decisions about their own risk. \"Over the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. \u2026 They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day. \u2026 We're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is.\" \u2014 Elisabeth Butler Cordova\n\nA man wearing a face mask holds a box of the American electronic commerce company Amazon in Central district, Hong Kong.

Sunniva Sorby, 59, and Hilde F\u00e5lulm Str\u00f8m, 52, co-founders of the Hearts in the Ice polar education campaign, told NBC that their several decades of research experience is \"reassuring\" and allows them to \"navigate the challenges of storms, aggressive polar bears and endless hours of darkness.\" The virus has postponed vital climate research and data collection worldwide, and scientists fear a long-term hit to their research budgets. The Arctic explorers, who have been collecting weather and wildlife data as well as motoring clouds and sea ice, said the silver lining of being stranded is that they can continue working even as other research is on hold. \u2014 Emma Newburger\n\nLaid off thanks to Covid-19? How to get help with rent, utilities and more\n\n10:40 am ET \u2014 Unemployed thanks to Covid-19, whether you're sick or not? Worried about how you're going to make ends meet? You've probably already gotten a federal stimulus check, or soon will, but you should know that there are other types of economic help out there. CNBC's Jill Cornfield takes a look at the range of aid available, from two weeks of paid leave \u2014 at full pay \u2014 to help with utility bills and rent and some extra time to file your 2019 tax return. \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nNew downturn gives a one-two punch for older Americans\n\n10:30 am ET \u2014 Coronavirus has sparked a new recession that, like previous downturns, will probably hit older Americans hardest. The Great Recession had already made retirement more difficult, forcing many seniors to stay in the workforce long after they reached 65. Now that Granny's likely been laid off from her shift at the bookstore, what's she supposed to do? CNBC's Annie Nova spoke with labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci, who leads the Retirement Equity Lab at The New School in New York, about why older Americans are particularly vulnerable in the current recession. They also talk about how the pandemic has exposed the real risks inherent in our current retirement paradigm. \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nTrump plans to restore a bit of WHO's funding\n\n9:50 am ET \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday said that the U.S. intends to restore 10% of its funding to the World Health Organization, though he noted that no official decision has been made. Trump suspended funding to the WHO on April 14 after criticizing the agency's response to the coronavirus outbreak and accusing it of promoting China's \"disinformation\" about the virus. WHO officials have denied those claims. \u2014 Emma Newburger\n\nDidn't get that stimulus check yet? This could be why\u2026\n\n9:38 am ET \u2014 Still waiting for that stimulus check? While more and more Americans \u2014 some 130 million, according to the latest IRS tally \u2014 are finally getting federal relief aid promised under the CARES Act by direct deposit or in the mail, others haven't seen a dime, or have gotten a lot less than they expected. Sure, Uncle Sam might have made a mistake. But it's more likely there's a good reason you haven't been paid yet \u2014 or were written a check for a lot less than you hoped. CNBC's Lorie Konish answers the most common questions readers have sent in about federal stimulus checks, from \"Why didn't I get a payment?\" to \"Will there be another round of stimulus?\" \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nHouse passes historic relief package\n\n8:42 am ET \u2014 The U.S. House of Representatives passed a coronavirus relief package worth $3 trillion on Friday night as lawmakers struggle to find common ground about how to respond to the pandemic that's ravaged the American economy. The Republican-led Senate opposes the Democrat-led House's legislation, and the White House has pledged to veto it in any case. The historic spending proposal includes nearly $1 trillion for state and local governments; a second distribution of direct payments worth $1,200 per person and up to $6,000 per household; hazard pay of $200 billion for essential workers; and $75 billion in virus testing efforts, among other things.

Instead, customers are getting used to new grocery store fixtures: Mask-wearing employees, plexiglass barriers at cash registers, one-way aisles and antibacterial wipe dispensers. Some of those will become the norm. Others will fade away as coronavirus cases decline. But many analysts predict the pandemic will change how customers stock their fridges and pantries and shape their expectations in the months or years ahead. Here's a round-up of five changes sparked by the pandemic:\n\nNo touching, please\n\nGetty Images\n\nCustomers are more squeamish about germs \u2014 and that could linger. Grocers and other retailers have touted new and expanded contactless approaches to shop or check out. Walmart, for example, added a new feature to its smartphone app that allows customers to scan a QR code instead of touching a screen at the cash register. Other apps, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, also allow customers to skip the credit card reader. With curbside pickup, customers can pop the trunk instead of going into stores. Some retailers have waived the need for a signature when people pick up groceries or get a delivery to their home. Some customers are opting for prepackaged goods, as they skip the deli counter and other parts of the store with additional food handling, said Jill Standish, Accenture's global head of retail. She said the grab-and-go items also shorten shoppers' time in stores, another common preference. Those approaches may stick because of their convenience, along with heightened safety.\n\n'Go local' trend on steroids\n\nProduce at an Arkansas farmer's market dlewis33 | iStock | Getty Images\n\nLong before the pandemic, customers bought fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and supported local businesses, such as cheese shops. The pandemic is accelerating that trend, said Scott McKenzie, Nielsen's head of global intelligence. Now, he said, people gravitate even more to products grown or made closer to home. They're thinking about the long distances that produce, meat and other foods may travel and the borders they may cross before arriving to their kitchen table \u2014 and the many people who may touch them along the way. That's driving more interest in subscriptions to farm boxes and items with \"a shorter supply chain,\" McKenzie said. \"I call this the phenomenon of buying milk from cows you can see,\" he said.\n\nShift to online shopping accelerates\n\nGetty Images\n\nGrocery shoppers have downloaded new grocery apps and tried new online services. Those discoveries have shaken up habits and could lead to a meaningful shift in an industry that's been slow to go digital. Customers have used third-party delivery services, such as Instacart, FreshDirect and Target-owned Shipt, to get groceries. They've also ordered online and used curbside or in-store pickup at Walmart and Target. Only about 3% or 4% of grocery spending in the U.S. was online before the coronavirus outbreak, according to research by consulting firm Bain & Company. That could increase to between 5% and 10% after it, said Steve Caine, a retail expert and partner for the firm.\n\nA personal touch by 'pickers'\n\nInstacart employee Monica Ortega checks her cellphone for orders while picking up groceries from a supermarket for delivery on March 19, 2020 in North Hollywood, California.

Brown | AFP via Getty Images\n\nGrocers will look for creative ways to strengthen relationships with customers and entice them to add more to their virtual baskets, as more customers shop online in addition to in-store. Employees who fulfill and bag online orders at stores \u2014 often called pickers or shoppers \u2014 will become increasingly important and could become a competitive advantage for retailers, said Eiko Kawano, a group experience director for digital consulting firm, Publicis Sapient. Grocers may use the employees as brand ambassadors and suggestive sellers, she said. Stores could ask pickers to upload a photo or a brief profile and allow customers to rate the pickers like Uber and Lyft drivers. Through a combination of personal relationships and algorithms, the shopper or picker could personalize customers' orders by recommending an item. And they could nudge customers towards higher margin items and discretionary purchases, too.\n\nThe rise of the robot\n\nHumanoid robot \"Prepper\" stands on April 2, 2020 at the cash desk of a supermarket of the Edeka retail chain in Lindlar, Germany, to explain protective measures and to promote solidarity with each other, amid the novel coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic.

It would be built around scientifically novel but increasingly available means to prevent future pandemics through constructing a \"global immune system.\"\n\nDavid Bray, the director of the Atlantic Council's GeoTech Center, launched this year to help harness emerging technologies for good, has been pioneering the concept of a \"Pandemic Prevention Board\" as a significant first step. He likens the system to a previous time when the public \"had to be convinced there was a need to install smoke detectors in large buildings linked to the fire department and automatic sprinkler systems to put out the fire.\"\n\nThe PPB initially would be an industry-driven answer to the now-obvious need, in the words of Bill Gates, for world leaders to \"take what has been learned from this tragedy and invest in systems to prevent future outbreaks.\" Gates, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, laid it out this way: \"We need to save lives now while also improving the way we respond to outbreaks in general. The first point is more pressing, but the second has crucial long-term consequences.\"\n\nThe involvement of global governments would be essential, in the best case by planting seeds as early as the U.S.-hosted G7 summit on June 10 or the Saudi-hosted G20 meeting on July 18 or at the United Nations General Assembly in September. The dream outcome would be that public and private sectors worldwide would join hands urgently in a multi-faceted and coordinated effort that would produce a truly \"new world order\" out of our existing Covid-19 chaos.\n\nDon't hold your breath for that kumbaya moment.\n\nIf this period has taught us anything it is that our political leaders of 2020 mostly were ill-prepared for the virus. Their responses thus far haven't been sufficiently cooperative, coordinated or pro-active to meet the historic challenge. With China and the United States on a collision course that's only likely to accelerate ahead of November's US elections, an industry-initiated approach could kick-start some tension-reducing collaboration, also among political leaders.\n\nThe PPB would represent an alliance of technology companies focused on advancing solutions to safeguard against future low probability, high consequence pandemics \u2013 either naturally occurring or manually designed. Though experts are afraid to say this out loud and thus tempt fate, the Covid-19 impact has also impressed terrorist and extremist groups about the low-cost, high-impact destructive power of pathogens.\n\nIn Bray's plan, the board's flagship initiative would center around the concept of building an \"immune system for the planet\" that could detect a novel pathogen in the air, water or soil and rapidly sequence its DNA or RNA. This detection would then trigger rapid sequencing to fully characterize the pathogen. Once sequenced, high performance computers would strive to identify both the three-dimensional protein surfaces of either the virus or bacteria and then search through an index of known molecular therapies that might be able to neutralize the pathogen.\n\nThe exponential reduction of the time required to take on a biothreat agent would save lives, property and national economies. With advances in biosensors, the Internet of Things and high-performance computing, it's not so far-fetched to imagine real-time data collection to identify problems early and guide responses.\n\nHowever, before getting too lost in the technologies that could make such a system work, it's worth reflecting on the cruel lessons of history that should shift even the harshest critics of multilateral collaboration into a more collaborative spirit to advance global resilience against future waves of the Covid-19 virus and future pandemics.\n\nIt is essential we do this, finding a way to collaborate across nations and business sectors, while we still have the chance.\n\nI've been rereading two books in the past days that richly relate history's lessons, must-reading for today's leaders.\n\nMargaret Macmillan's \"Paris 1919\" illustrates how the United States and its European partners failed the test after World War I; Dean Acheson's \"Present at the Creation\" chronicles in great detail how, chastened by that experience, President Harry Truman and others used the post-World War II years to construct an international order that has delivered more than seven decades of growing prosperity and relative peace among major powers.\n\nParis 1919 \"is a study of flawed decisions with terrible consequences, many of which haunt us to this day,\" writes the late Richard Holbrooke in the book's foreword. A single paragraph can't settle the debate over President Woodrow Wilson's degree of blame for that failure. He had plenty of accomplices among the U.S. and international leaders of those times. However, what followed is undeniable: nationalism, fascism, the Holocaust and World War II.\n\n\"Present at the Creation\" is about a post-war challenge, writes Acheson, that was \"just a bit less formidable than that described in the first chapter of Genesis. That was to create a world out of chaos; ours, to create half a world, a free half, out of the same material without blowing the whole to pieces in the process. The wonder of it is how much was done.\"\n\nThat leaves today's leaders to either watch the existing, rules-based global order \u2013 with all its flaws and dysfunctions \u2013 tear apart under the coronavirus strain. Or they can search for ways to finish Acheson's half-complete job by creating something more inclusive, drawing upon public health as an indisputable common cause.\n\nThat could advance the concept of a world where the U.S. and China continue to compete fiercely in large number of other areas, but where at the same time they show they can collaborate as well. That would begin with collaborative efforts to keep their citizens healthy from future novel pathogens, but they at the same time could establish habits that serve other concerns ranging from climate and trade to avoiding a modern-age superpower war with devastating consequences.\n\n\"Washington's sins of omission and Beijing's sins of commission have conspired to sideline international institutions, helping frustrate their common goal of ending the pandemic,\" write Thomas R. Pickering and Atman M. Trivedi this week in Foreign Affairs.\n\nThey point to previous times when the U.S. and China engaged in cooperative research and shared information to combat SARS and the avian flu in 2003, the swine flu in 2009, and the Ebola virus in 2014. During the Cold War, they write, Moscow and Washington \"quietly collaborated on polio and smallpox vaccines.\"\n\nIt may seem hopelessly na\u00efve to expect an even more ambitious degree of global collaboration now, but history's lesson is that the alternatives are horrifying.\n\nFrederick Kempe is a best-selling author, prize-winning journalist and president & CEO of the Atlantic Council, one of the United States' most influential think tanks on global affairs.

Unofficial tallies, mostly tracked by concerned Amazon employees who receive text message alerts whenever one of their colleagues catches the coronavirus, peg the total number of cases at 900 or more.\n\nThere could easily be more deaths and infections within Amazon's walls, but the company has declined to disclose the impact the pandemic has had on its employees. Instead, Amazon has only verified deaths when they're dug up by members of the media, leaving us with a fuzzy picture at best as to how dangerous this work actually is.\n\nAmazon disagrees. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" on May 10, Amazon's operations boss David Clark said disclosing the number of \"isn't particularly useful,\" and instead said the focus should be on the rate of cases relative to the number of workers in a warehouse and the communities in which they live. Amazon hasn't disclosed that rate either.\n\nAmazon should release the number of infections and deaths among its workforce, or, at the very least, figures that show the rate of the infections inside its warehouses.\n\nOur notion of an \"essential worker\" has dramatically changed since the start of the pandemic. It's not just doctors, nurses, police officers, firefighters and members of the military. In the time of the coronavirus, the definition has expanded to include sanitation workers, grocery store clerks, food-delivery workers and warehouse workers who ship goods ordered online.\n\nOver the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. We've asked them to show up to work amid a deadly pandemic that has already killed at least 86,000 people and affected at least 1.4 million in the U.S. They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day.\n\nWe're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is. We're asking them to choose between no paycheck and putting their lives at risk. We're asking them to do all this just to keep the basic standard of living we've become accustomed to humming as a virus ravages the country.\n\nIf Amazon disclosed its infection and death data, it would provide valuable insight not just to workers who need to make decisions about their paychecks and health, but also to employers grappling with the same issues as Amazon.\n\nAs other businesses slowly begin to open again across the country, they'll need all the help they can get to make sure they're protecting their workers and customers, just like the essential businesses who have been operating through the pandemic have done. There are lessons to learn, but those lessons become more difficult without the data.\n\nAmazon's biggest rival in retail, Walmart, also has a slew of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, but has routinely declined to disclose its own data and faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of one of its employees who died from the coronavirus. Other horror stories have cropped up in essential businesses from Tyson meat plants to grocery store chains like Costco and Kroger that are grappling with long lines and customers angry over social distancing rules.\n\nAmazon has proven it can be a leader. For example, in October 2018, Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. But Amazon went further than just raising wages. It also said it would advocate to bring the federal minimum wage up to the same standard, and CEO Jeff Bezos dared other large employers to do the same.\n\n\"We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,\" Bezos said in a statement at the time. \"We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\"\n\nNow it's time for Amazon to lead again. It's an icon of American industry, like General Electric and General Motors were decades ago. It's the company many businesses admire and look to for guidance. Through its innovation and relentless drive, Amazon has earned the burden of setting the standard for how business works in this country.\n\nSo far, Amazon has done a great job talking about the safety measures it has taken to protect its warehouse workers. It provides regular updates on its dedicated Covid-19 blog, which reads like a template for just about any large business grappling with how to safely operate during the pandemic. Face masks. Temperature checks. Social distancing. Hand sanitzer. Gloves. And so on. Amazon should be commended for moving as rapidly as it could to implement these changes throughout its sprawling logistics network. That's no small feat.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon said it plans to reinvest all of its profits this quarter -- an estimated $4 billion -- into its Covid-19 response. Hundreds of millions of dollars of that will go towards its own development of Covid-19 tests, a key to getting all of its employees safely back to work. It said it could spend $1 billion on testing alone this year. Compare that to the White House's response to the testing shortage.\n\nWorkers are scared, even as they do important work for pay that doesn't match up to the risk they're taking. Amazon has the opportunity to shine light on just how dangerous this work is by being the first major important to disclose its worker death and infection counts.\n\nHopefully others would then follow Amazon's lead.", "author": ["Steve Kovach"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/coronavirus-nearly-killed-this-young-bronx-man.html", "published": "2020-05-16T18:26:53", "title": "Coronavirus nearly took this young Bronx man's life, now the shutdown threatens his livelihood", "text": "Amaurys Grullon (L), founder of Bronx Native, and Josue Caceres (R), brand manager. Caceres caught coronavirus and was in a coma for 11 days. Spencer Kimball | CNBC\n\nJosue Caceres remembers waking up in a hospital bed. He tried to get up and go to the bathroom, but he was so weak he fell and hit his head.\n\n\n\nWhen he woke up from the fall, the doctor told him he had caught Covid-19, had gone into a coma for 11 days and was placed on a ventilator. Although his family has a history of high blood pressure, the 25-year-old Caceres is otherwise healthy. He still doesn't know how he caught the virus.\n\n\n\n\"I hardly went outside \u2014 I was taking this quarantine very serious,\" Caceres said. \"The few times I went out I had masks and gloves.\"\n\n\n\nIt started in late March when Caceres started to feel ill. He thought it was the flu and he just needed rest. But his mother, Dorka, became concerned when he started to complain of chest pain. She thought something might be wrong with his heart and decided to call 911. The EMT checked Caceres, said his heart was fine and decided against taking him to the hospital because he didn't display symptoms of the virus. But his condition quickly deteriorated after the EMT visit as he started experiencing severe shortness of breath. \"I couldn't breathe \u2014 I was literally just gasping for air,\" Caceres said. \" I would just take a few steps and it felt like I ran a marathon.\" His mother and brother saw how ill he suddenly looked and called the ambulance again. That's around the time Caceres went unconscious. His family wasn't able to visit him while he was hospitalized and intubated due to protocols to prevent the virus from spreading. Caceres' lungs and kidneys weren't functioning properly. During those 11 days, his mother Dorka feared for his life and would call the hospital constantly to check on his condition.\n\n\n\n\"I truly feel like if I was alone I probably would have died because I wasn't aware of anything \u2014 I couldn't do anything,\" Caceres said.\n\n'It just hit home'\n\nCaceres lives in the Bronx, one of the hardest-hit boroughs in the hardest-hit city in the U.S. More than 42,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the Bronx and at least 3,293 have died from Covid-19 as of Friday. Every day brings more death and infections.\n\n\n\nPeople are fighting for their lives and their livelihoods as the virus rips through the borough and businesses deemed nonessential by the state have remained closed for eight weeks now in an effort to contain the epidemic. The Bronx is particularly vulnerable to the public health and economic crises triggered by the virus. The borough has the lowest health outcomes in New York state and has high rates of asthma and diabetes. The number of people living in poverty is the highest in New York City at 27%. Amaurys Grullon, 27, was tired of the stereotypes he always heard about his home when growing up. In 2016, Grullon founded a business called Bronx Native to showcase the borough's culture and creativity. He asked Caceres, his childhood friend, to join the business as brand manager and help manage the store.\n\nA man walks past a wall mural in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. May, 14 2020. Spencer Kimball | CNBC\n\n\"For me the Bronx is the most beautiful place on Earth \u2014 I wanted to change the narrative,\" Grullon said. The store, located in Mott Haven, sells apparel, accessories and acts as community space to the neighborhood, hosting everything from comedy to financial literacy classes. Business was good until the pandemic, Grullon said. They had to close the shop's doors when the state declared their business nonessential, and sales fell 50% even as the store has ramped up its online business to compensate, Grullon said. Then, as the business was in turmoil, Caceres caught the virus.\n\n\n\nGrullon knew something was wrong when Caceres wasn't responding to his messages. He contacted Caceres' mother, who told him his friend had fallen into a coma.\n\n\n\n\"When I heard that news \u2014 it's when I really realized this is serious,\" Grullon said. \"Josue is a young kid, 25 \u2014 younger than me. It just hit home, and when things hit home they hit differently.\"\n\n'We're in a very difficult position'\n\nCaceres' lungs started responding, his condition started to improve and he was taken off intubation. He survived the virus and is healthy now, but it's unclear if Bronx Native will survive the shutdown. Grullon has applied for a small business loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program to help keep the store afloat. Grullon originally tried to apply through Chase, but he heard from other business owners he might have a better shot with a smaller community bank. He applied at Ponce Bank and also through PayPal when it started accepting loan applications. Unlike Chase, neither Ponce nor Paypal require applicants to have existing accounts, which has made it easier for many small businesses to apply.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the program and its rules, navigating the application and getting the right documents together in such a short time was frustrating. Grullon said he was totally in the dark when he first started looking into applying for funding a month ago. Bronx Native has since been approved for a $25,000 loan through Paypal. Small businesses like Bronx Native initially struggled to get their applications processed amid the confusion and technical problems that plagued the rollout of the program, while a number of publicly traded companies who were clients of big banks were approved for loans before the first round of money ran out.\n\n\n\nWhen the program reopened with more funding, $30 billion was set aside for smaller lenders. The idea was to get money to underserved communities and minority business owners. The $30 billion ran out in less than two days, according to Kenneth Kelly, chairman of the National Bankers Association, which represents minority-owned banks.\n\nThe Bronx Chamber of Commerce is worried the retail vacancy rate will skyrocket due to the shutdown caused by the pandemic. Spencer Kimball | US\n\nA government watchdog report found minority and women-owned businesses may not have received loans because the Small Business Administration did not instruct lenders to prioritize underserved communities as called for under the law.\n\n\n\nLisa Sorin, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, said few businesses in the borough received money during the first round of lending. The problem, Sorin said, is the Paycheck Protection Program defines a small business as 500 or fewer employees. But in the Bronx most businesses have fewer than 10 employees, which means they are competing with much larger and better equipped companies for money.\n\n\n\nMore businesses in the Bronx started to get funding when the program set aside money for smaller banks, Sorin said, but it's still not enough to meet the needs of the 23,000 businesses in the borough. Sorin is concerned the pandemic will force scores of businesses to close for good, ending a period of progress in which unemployment had fallen to historic lows and the number of businesses reached a four-decade high.\n\n\n\nMany business districts in the Bronx are projecting retail vacancy rates as high as 50% by August, according to Michael Brady, executive director of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District. \"That's taking us back to the mid-'90s when the vacancy rate was out of control,\" Sorin said, \"and that's a very scary position to be in when we were in an upward curve for the borough.\" As he waited for funding, Grullon started a GoFundMe campaign with a goal to raise $20,000 to help pay rent, utilities and vendors. He said the community has been supportive.\n\n\n\n\"We are in a very difficult position right now because it's a very uncertain time,\" Grullon said. \"Everyday we're trying to figure out ways to adapt.\"\n\n'This was an older person's disease'\n\nThe crisis hit home for Noelle Santos when she heard that Caceres, her friend, was in a coma. Santos owns The Lit. Bar, a bookstore and bar, around the corner from Bronx Native.\n\n\n\n\"We were told this was an older person's disease and the younger people were just keeping the older safe,\" Santos said. \"Once our friend in his mid-20s got sick and he was in a coma for 11 days fighting for his life \u2014 that really shook us up.\" Santos knew the situation was getting serious before Caceres fell ill. She voluntarily closed The Lit. Bar a few days before the state ordered nonessential businesses to do so. Santos was worried about the health and safety of her customers after the state first told businesses to operate at reduced capacity to help control the outbreak.\n\n\n\n\"They were leaving it up to me to protect people and I didn't feel confident in my ability to do that,\" she said.\n\nNoelle Santos opened Lit. Bar in April of 2019 after the closing of Barnes & Noble left the Bronx without a general interest bookstore.

Alexi Rosenfeld | Getty Images\n\nSanitation workers across the country are trying to adjust to unusually high waste levels in residential areas as the coronavirus pandemic shuts in much of the workforce at home. Waste in residential areas has spiked by as much as 40% in some parts of the country, according to one company's tally. To facilitate curbside pickup services, waste management companies are urging both their workers and clients to follow proper disposal protocols. To deal with the onslaught, some sanitation workers, who pick up and haul garbage and other waste, have begun to double or triple the number of trips they would make to residential neighborhoods under more normal circumstances. Often taken for granted, sanitation workers have become part of the frontline workforce keeping the country going even as the pandemic persists. And though they largely operate in the background of everyday life, they provide services that bolster comfortable living and cleanliness across the country. \"You can go your whole life without ever calling upon a firefighter or a police officer, but you can't go more than a couple days without having a sanitation worker in your life,\" said Belinda Mager, the director of communications at New York's sanitation department. \"They visit your block at least a couple days a week, and you may not even know it! But you'd know it if they were not there!\" Data collected in December from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that people who gather and dispose of waste and recyclable materials work the fifth most dangerous job in the United States. The coronavirus has heightened that risk factor. The pandemic adds to the inherent dangers of the job the risk of contracting the disease while handling waste with contaminated materials such as used tissues or face masks. This story is based on conversations with people linked to six waste removal groups in New York, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, five states that represent some of the greatest risk zones for sanitation workers.\n\nThe risks\n\nIn an effort to minimize employees' risk of contracting the disease, several waste removal groups have been urging the public to dispose of their waste safely by \"putting all trash in closed bags, carts or containers,\" said David Biderman, executive director and CEO of Solid Waste Association of North America, or SWANA, a nonprofit that advocates for efficient solid waste management. \"We don't want sanitation collection workers touching discarded tissues or other material from a home in which someone has tested positive to coronavirus,\" Biderman said. Some companies, such as Florida-based Waste Pro USA, have issued guidance on how to handle waste. The company created a flyer that educates \"customers on how to properly dispose of their trash and recycling to protect themselves and our crews that is available to download on our website\" said Ron Pecora, senior vice president of Waste Pro USA, which operates in 11 states. Increased safety protocols have also extended to the companies themselves. Sanitation workers have received gloves, masks, and disinfecting products from their employers to maximize their own safety. And they're encouraged to practice social distancing while collecting trash. \"Traditionally everyone always wore gloves. But now everyone wears a thinner latex glove on the inside, in addition to a thick glove on the outside,\" said Josh Eisenstein, director of community outreach at Filco Carting, a Brooklyn, New York, waste management company.\n\nSanitation workers clean and disinfect the streets of Skidrow during the coronavirus pandemic on April 20, 2020 in Los Angeles, California. Tommaso Boddi | Getty Images\n\nTrucks are cleaned and disinfected frequently, said a spokesperson from Republic Services, an Arizona-based waste collection company operating in 41 states and Puerto Rico. \"All of our facilities and equipment are on an enhanced cleaning schedule, with cleanings scheduled multiple times per day,\" the spokesperson said. In Arizona, the new safety protocols have extended into processing centers, too, where employees are separated by \"plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe.\" SWANA estimates that nearly 1,000 sanitation workers have tested positive for the coronavirus around the country, \"the majority of them in the New York City metropolitan area,\" Biderman said. But it's likely that these workers contracted the virus because of \"community spread, not contact with the trash,\" he added.\n\nSpikes in residential waste\n\nWaste among residential homes has increased as most Americans stay at home under shelter-in-place orders. \"Residential waste volume has increased between 5% to 35%, depending on the location, as Americans have been staying home and generating more trash and recyclables,\" Biderman said. At Waste Management, headquartered in Texas, residential waste went up by 25%, according to Janette Micelli, director of external affairs. To keep up with the unexpected volume of waste, several sanitation companies have suspended bulk pick-up services, meaning that sanitation workers temporarily avoid picking up large materials like tossed-out furniture. About 80 communities nationwide have reported temporary suspensions in curbside recycling or yard waste collection, according to estimates from SWANA. \"This was because these communities' sanitation departments have limited bandwidth and resources, and need to use their assets (trucks, people) to collect trash,\" Biderman explained. Some communities have begun to resume these services. In Southern California, sanitation workers have shut down some recycling facilities due to inability to keep adequate distance between workers, causing some curbside recyclables to end up in the landfill. Meanwhile, some companies have altered their schedules to keep up with the increased need for waste removal. Shelter-in-place guidelines have caused Americans to be \"thrown off their routine,\" said Pecora of Waste Pro USA, which has seen a 40% increase in residential waste in some areas. \"Rather than placing their materials out before going to work, they have been placing their materials out after our trucks have serviced their streets, resulting in a spike in calls concerning missed pickups,\" Pecora said. Additionally, Waste Pro USA workers have been reporting higher numbers of \"bulk items,\" including old televisions and mattresses, in Florida. It is an indication that many Americans are using the time at home to do some heavy-duty spring cleaning. \"This huge volume has resulted in significant increased expense as trucks are filling up and have to dispose, and then go back to same routes to complete,\" Pecora said.\n\nCommercial waste falls\n\nAs residential waste rises, commercial waste is in a state of free fall, tumbling because of closures of nonessential businesses and stay-at-home guidelines. The biggest blow to commercial waste occurred \"in major cities,\" according to SWANA's Biderman. Filco Carting in Brooklyn has seen commercial waste drop by 50% since the pandemic hit. Commercial waste removal from places like restaurants and small businesses can only be handled by privately owned waste removal companies in New York. Once New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued orders of statewide shutdowns, business at New York waste removal companies began to drop off. \"Most private carters are operating with less trucks, as many customers are not operating, not producing waste and therefore less trucks are needed to collect the reduced waste,\" said Eisenstein of Filco. And businesses that have stayed open to offer essential services, like supermarkets, have reduced their waste, Eisenstein said, likely because fewer customers have been entering. Some of these businesses \"requested reduction in their frequency of pickups. Weeks ago when businesses were forced to close, many reached out to us to suspend service,\" he said.\n\nGoing forward", "author": ["Yelena Dzhanova"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/chinese-rocket-falls-to-earth-space-debris-problem-worsens.html", "published": "2020-05-16T15:30:01", "title": "A Chinese rocket weighing 18 tons falls to Earth as space junk crisis hits a tipping point", "text": "In this May 5, 2020, file photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's new large carrier rocket Long March 5B blasts off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in southern China's Hainan Province. Tu Haichao | Xinhua | AP\n\nSince humans first went up in space in 1961, we've done a poor job of keeping it clean. NASA currently estimates that there are some 21,000 pieces of space junk larger than a softball orbiting the Earth and 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger. Since the debris travels at speeds of up to 17,500 mph, they could damage a satellite or spacecraft. Just last week an 18-ton Chinese rocket passed over Los Angeles and New York City's Central Park before falling into the Atlantic Ocean. The estimated 8,800 tons of objects that humans have left in space are becoming a danger. Near misses are common these days. Last September there was one between Elon Musk's SpaceX satellite and one from the European Space Agency. But so far, there has been just one major collision: In 2009 American satellite Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251, a Russian satellite, crashed, destroying both over northern Siberia. In January a satellite run by AT&T's DirecTV was found to be in danger of exploding and needed to be moved or else it could harm other satellites. Since that time, no action has been taken. Meanwhile, in late April the FCC voted to require more disclosures from satellite operators seeking licenses but declined to introduce any new laws governing the removal of orbital debris.\n\nCompanies rush to address the problem\n\nAccording to experts, the problem is projected to get worse. By 2025 as many as 1,100 satellites could be launching each year. The number of satellites orbiting Earth is projected to quadruple over the next decade. Astroscale, one of the few companies whose mission is to clean up such space debris, is leading the charge to clean up our space pathways and avoid collisions among the objects that humans recently have left in space. The Japanese company is currently working with Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to carry out the agency's Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration (CRD2) project.\n\nKanae Kobori, an engineer with Japanese space start-up company Astroscale, demonstrates pulling a magnet off of a piece of steel during the 35th Space Symposium at The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, Colorado on April 9, 2019. Jason Connolly | AFP | Getty Images\n\nThe JAXA mission plans to complete its first phase by the end of 2022. The goal of the mission is to launch a satellite that will observe and acquire data on the rocket upper stage that the second phase will seek to deorbit. The idea is to find out how the debris moves in space and set up a safe and successful removal. Astroscale is not alone in seeking to clean up space debris. Northrop Grumman last year launched its first Mission Extension Vehicle spacecraft (MEV-1) to prove it could intercept falling satellites, repair them, remove them from traffic and put them back in orbit. Swiss start-up ClearSpace, meanwhile, has a more specific goal: to remove a 100kg Vega Secondary Payload Adapter (Vespa) upper-stage rocket orbiting around 400 miles above Earth. It plans to do that in 2025.\n\nPetrovich9 | Getty Images\n\nA NASA spokesperson noted that solving the issue will take cooperation between nations. \"The remediation of the near-Earth space environment will necessarily involve not only a multi-agency approach but an international effort,\" said J.D. Harrington, public affairs officer at NASA. Harrington estimated that the U.S. was responsible for less than a third of all the detritus. Tom Wilson, vice president of Northrop Grumman space systems, said the company is pioneering the market for in-space satellite servicing and logistics services with its Mission Extension Vehicle. \"Our efforts are driven by our customers' needs to protect their space assets,\" he said. \"MEV provides a roadmap for a broader range of servicing,\" he said.

With summer just a little more than a month away, camp directors are still deciding if it's safe for camps to operate amid the coronavirus pandemic. And parents are equally concerned. On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said camps should not reopen unless they are able to implement coronavirus screening protocols, evaluating employees and children daily for symptoms and potential past exposures to Covid-19. But compliance with the CDC direction will depend on whether states adopt the decision tools into their own local policies \u2014 and whether the Trump administration supports and promotes the agency's guidelines. State and local guidance is expected to be provided as early as next week. According to Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, we are \"still in the early innings\" of the coronavirus crisis, but if it were up to him, he would choose to send his kids to a sleepaway camp over a day camp. At CNBC's Healthy Returns virtual conference on Tuesday, Gottlieb expressed that \"sleepaway camps have the potential to create a protective bubble that is easier to do than at day camps.\" That's because at day camps the campers and staff are constantly coming and going, which could increase the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.\n\nBut Helene Drobenare, a social worker and the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camps in New York, said it's a misnomer that any camp can provide a bubble against Covid-19. \"A bubble is to assume that when you close the gate, that means you can't get mail, you can't get a milk delivery, you can't send anybody in or out to get any kind of food or supplies, and it means you won't have any day workers,\" she said. \"We probably could do a bubble for a very short time period, maybe a few days. I think a bubble is what we want to believe and it's what our hearts want and that's what we want for our children \u2014 a place that will be 100% safe and the disease won't find them there. But in my opinion, I don't think overnight camp can give that coverage. Nowhere in the world today could give that coverage. If it could, we wouldn't be where we are.\" Camp Young Judaea has two day camps \u2014 one in Brooklyn and one in Croton-on-Hudson \u2014 as well as an overnight camp in the Hudson Valley. Collectively, about 750 campers attend the camps, which are considered to be in the coronavirus epicenter.\n\nHelene Drobenare, surrounded by campers at Young Judaea Sprout Camp in 2019 Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camp\n\nJay Jacobs, executive director of Timber Lake Camps, told CNBC's John Fortt on \"Squawk Alley\" last week that he is hopeful his camps will run as planned this summer, claiming that there are ways to ensure a protected environment, especially in sleepaway, or residential, camps. TLC Camps is comprised of seven camps located in Long Island, the Catskill region of New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. His camps serve about 3,000 children. \"You can test your staff before they come to camp. You can test your campers before they come to camp and only accept those with negative tests, so you've already locked out Covid-19, at least initially,\" he said. \"Remember, many resident camps are in rural communities where the prevalence of the virus is not as great as down in the cities or suburbs.\"\n\nQuarantine's effect on kids' mental health\n\nSome mental health experts believe that the harmful effect of kids in indefinite quarantine outweigh the risk of coronavirus exposure at camp. \"The need for connection is as fundamental a need as our need for food, oxygen and shelter, says humanistic psychologist Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman, author of \"Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization.\" \"Of course, we must make sure that all children are protected from exposure to the coronavirus, but this protection shouldn't come at the expense of opportunities for shared play, connection and friendship. The right balance of our needs is necessary to become a fully functioning human being.\"\n\nSwimmers at Young Judaea Sprout Camp enjoying the pool last season\n\nBut Denise Daniels, a pediatric oncology nurse and child development expert, says that while she has empathy for the kids hoping to attend summer camp, she has trepidation about them sleeping in bunk beds, sharing showers, making crafts and having meals together on those long wooden tables in the food pavilion. \"I understand what a critical time this is for the mental health and well-being of families after being on lockdown, adhering to social distancing and upholding the endless health rituals of washing hands, coughing and sneezing in elbows, wearing masks and staying six feet apart,\" she says. \"Lots of kids will be attending virtual summer camps this year, and unbelievably, there are tons of fun activities kids can do outside on Zoom or Skype.\" Camp Young Judaea's Drobenare agrees. \"For the first time, they are creating relationships through a screen and not through touch or eye contact, but I believe that we have to deal the cards that are in front of us right now,\" she said. \"If you are asking me to choose between a disease that I'm not sure if it will cause death, or to help these kids somehow build relationships and find hope through a screen, then I think we have to do that and be as creative as we can until we can get through this. It's not the optimal situation, but I think life outweighs anything else in this type of risk.\"\n\nThe American Camp Association, a community of camp professionals that has been in existence for over 100 years, is weighing the guidance from the CDC, along with rules and guidance from the state boards of health and other experts, to help individual camps make the decision as to whether they think they should operate camp this summer and if they could do so subject to the CDC's and state's rules. The ACA's mission is to ensure the quality of its 3,100 member camps across the U.S., which serves more than 10 million of the 20 million children who attend camps every summer across America. \"There's two words in social distance,\" ACA CEO Tom Rosenberg told CNBC's Scott Wapner on \"The Path Forward\" last week. \"First, as parents, we had to help our kids learn to distance themselves from their friends, and now as parents we are watching our kids starve themselves socially and emotionally from their own identity.\" Rosenberg is a leading voice for young people today, advancing the public's understanding of the value of camp for everyone as an essential developmental and educational experience.\n\nHeading off to Camp Virtual\n\nWhile the ACA CEO said he is hopeful camps will be open this summer \u2014 not only for the survival of the camp industry but also so kids can begin to reconnect \u2014 he understands there is a very real possibility that camp may look very different in 2020. \"I expect to see all kinds of summer experiences. Like a continuum of camp. So this summer, camp will look different. It may even be virtual for some. But those connections are going to happen, and children will have joyful experiences that help them learn and grow with each other,\" said Rosenberg. \"Before the pandemic even began, Gen Z kids really had skyrocketing depression and anxiety. And then comes Covid 19. ... We are trying to create connections to help them reconnect with each other, to reconnect with adults and to themselves.\"\n\nAmerican Camp Association CEO Tom Rosenberg says camp may be very different this year, and even virtual for some. Alina Solovyova-Vincent | E+ | Getty Images\n\nAs soon as shelter-in-place orders went into effect in the New York area, Drobenare says she closed Camp Young Judaea and in under two weeks pivoted to create Sprout@Home, a menu of activities including book clubs, yoga classes and online bunk meetups with a counselor. \"We may not be able to be together physically today, but we could be together emotionally and spiritually still,\" said Drobenare, who added that a final decision will be made by the end of the month as to whether or not they will run the camps this summer.\n\nCoronavirus-related cases in youth\n\nHeadlines swirling the last several weeks about coronavirus-related cases rising among youth is also top of mind for parents and camp directors. To date at least 110 cases have been reported in New York, and three young people \u2014 ages 5, 7 and 18 \u2014 have died. Doctors believe the illness \u2014 which the CDC now calls multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C \u2014 has been reported in at least 19 states and Washington, D.C. It was previously referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\nThe condition appears to be a post-viral syndrome caused by a delayed immune system response to the coronavirus that can lead to blood vessel inflammation. The inflammatory disease is similar to Kawasaki disease, an illness most common in young children that causes high fever and swelling in blood vessels. Children may also develop a rash and experience abdominal pain and vomiting. Most of the kids who have developed the condition are between 5 and 9 years old and have either tested positive for coronavirus or were found to have antibodies, suggesting that they'd previously been infected.\n\nA hopeful decline in late summer\n\nGottlieb is more optimistic about easing lockdown guidelines in late summer months. When the former FDA commissioner was asked by CNBC's Tyler Mathisen at the virtual conference if he would let his children swim at a public swimming pool or swim club this summer, he did not commit to an answer but said, \"Hopefully there's going to be a seasonal effect here and we are going to see cases decline in July or August and we can all take a little breather in the summer.\" Nevertheless, he is still very concerned about the fall as the virus settles into a more \"seasonal pattern.\" \"If you want to be optimistic, last week we had an average of around 27,000 new cases a day and 1,700 deaths. That's down from about 30,000 cases and 2,000 deaths. But it's still too early to tell.\" To date the U.S. has nearly 1.46 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and at least 87,603 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

By her calculations, the pandemic will force another 3.1 million older workers into poverty in their retirement, with many forced to choose between their health and their need for a paycheck.\n\nCNBC spoke with Ghilarducci about why older Americans are particularly vulnerable to this recession, and what the pandemic's fallout has revealed to us about the risks of our current retirement system.\n\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nCNBC: How do you see this recession impacting older workers and retirement differently than previous recessions?\n\nTeresa Ghilarducci: The unemployment rate. It's going up among older workers faster than any other group, except for the very young. They probably won't get back into the labor force, or it'll take them a long time to get another job. That means they'll draw down on their retirement savings, they may go into debt and they'll also apply for Social Security earlier, forgoing increased benefits. As a result, people who are middle-class workers now will be poor or near-poor retirees for the rest of their lives.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nHere's where people are turning for cash\n\nPayment apps may pose a coronavirus scam threat\n\nMillennials double down on emergency savings\n\nCNBC: Why are so many older Americans being thrown out of work during the pandemic?\n\nTG: It has to do with the jobs they were in. Education and health care, health care that wasn't involved with Covid care: dentist offices, optometrist offices, home health care, these are jobs that were all lost in the last couple of months and were disproportionately filled by older workers, and older women, by the way. Women have been harder hit than men in the Covid recession, and older women especially.\n\nCNBC: Why is it harder for older workers who've lost their jobs to get re-hired than it is for younger workers? And how could the pandemic exacerbate the problem?\n\nTG: There's the sense that older workers don't have the skills or potential that younger workers have and, in most cases, that's an irrational, discriminatory prejudice. But in this recession, caused by the pandemic, there may be a rational basis for the age discrimination. Older workers coming back to work may face much worse health hazards, and they will need special accommodations by their employers. The employer of an older worker may be concerned about their health and the liability associated with not providing a safe working place.", "author": ["Annie Nova"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/coronavirus-how-to-sell-your-home-during-pandemic.html", "published": "2020-05-16T15:00:02", "title": "How to sell your home in the age of coronavirus", "text": "Not a lot of homeowners want to put their homes on the market in the midst of a pandemic, but some do need to move, and it's not the worst time to sell.

Economists polled by Dow Jones expected U.S. consumer sentiment to drop to 65 in May. \u2013Li\n\n9:56 am: New York manufacturing slumps but beats estimates\n\nBusiness activity continues to contract in New York, though not as bad as economists had feared. The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey saw a reading of -48.5%, which signified a sharp contraction but not as bad as Dow Jones estimates of -60. The index measures companies reporting expansion against those seeing contraction, which in the May survey was 14.5% vs. 63.% respectively. Both new orders (-42.4%) and shipments (-39%) showed a continuing downturn but were significantly better than the April gauges. Notably, the employment reading was -6.1%, as 14.7% of employers reported increasing staff while 20.8% said they are seeing decreases. That net measure, though, was far better than the -55.3% reported in April. \u2013 Cox\n\n9:50 am: Cramer on signs of US-China trade escalation: 'Are we crazy?'\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday that now is not the time for the U.S. and China to escalate trade tensions as the world already faces unprecedented economic calamity from the coronavirus pandemic. \"What are we crazy?\" Cramer asked, adding the prospect of retaliation from China is \"scary.\" The \"Mad Money\" host's comments come after the Trump administration's move to block semiconductor shipments to Huawei. \u2013Li, Belvedere\n\n9:36 am: Retail store sales by category, clothing stores took biggest hit\n\nAll but one of 13 major retail categories experienced declines in sales in April. Clothing stores took the biggest hit with a 78.8% drop, while electronics and appliance stores saw a 60.6% decline. Non-store sales, which includes online sellers, is the only category with gains. \u2013Li\n\n9:30 am: Stocks open lower, Dow down 200 points\n\nMajor U.S. equity averages traded lower at the open as a record drop in retail sales dented sentiment as signs of increased trade tensions with China added to investors' anxiety. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 200 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1% at the open. \u2014 Li\n\n8:30 am: Retail sales plunge a record 16.4% in April\n\nConsumer spending sank by a record 16.4% in April as a main component of the U.S. economy contracted amid the Covid-19 outbreak, according to a government report Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected the advanced retail sales number to fall 12.3%. Some 68% of the U.S.'s $21.5 trillion economy is derived from personal consumption expenditures, which tumbled 7.6% in the first quarter as social distancing measures began to take effect. \u2014 Cox, Franck\n\n8:10 am: Barclays raises oil target\n\nBarclays raised its target on West Texas Intermediate and Brent on Friday, saying that while prices will likely remain volatile in the short term as the market re-balances, the worst is now over. \"Market forces have aligned producers around the world to support fundamentals and demand is increasingly showing signs of having troughed,\" the firm said. Barclays sees WTI and Brent averaging $33 and $37 this year, respectively, before rebounding to $50 and $53 in 2021. WTI traded around $28.23 per barrel on Friday, with Brent at $31.70. \u2014 Stevens\n\n8 am: China insider says the country could activate 'unreliable entity list' to retaliate\n\nHu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Chinese state-run publication Global Times, said in a tweet Friday that if the U.S. takes further action to block supply to Huawei, China will activate the \"unreliable entity list\", \"restrict or investigate\" U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple, and suspend the purchase of Boeing airplanes. His comment came after the White House moved to prevent shipments of semiconductors to the Chinese telecom giant as tensions between the two nations flared up again amid the coronavirus pandemic. The companies Hu mentioned came under pressure in premarket trading Friday with shares of Qualcomm and Cisco dropping 5.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Apple also fell 2.4% in premarket, while Boeing dipping 3.5%. Hu's Twitter account was closely followed by many Wall Street traders for insight on the trade war last year. His commentary appeared to have inside knowledge about the U.S.-China trade relationship and has sometimes been market-moving. The Global Times is a tabloid under the People's Daily which is the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China. \u2014 Li\n\n7:55 am: Consumer purchases probably hit a new record low in April\n\nRetail sales are expected to hit new depths in April as wary consumers stayed home and bought mainly essentials online. The advance reading, to be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a plunge of 12.3%, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones. That comes a month after a record 8.7% drop for data that goes back to 1992. The previous low was a 3.8% decline in November 2008 during the financial crisis. Consumers account for about 68% of all U.S. economic activity, so the retail figures are critical. \u2014 Cox\n\n7:50 am: Chip stocks fall amid Huawei worries\n\nSemiconductor stocks fell in premarket trading after the Commerce Department said it would move to block the sale of chips to Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Shares of Micron were trading 3.4% lower, while Nvidia fell roughly 2%. Broadcom and Intel both slipped 1.8%. \u2014 Pound\n\n7:43 am: White House moves to block chips to China's Huawei\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday took action to prevent shipments of semiconductors to China's telecom giant Huawei Technologies. The Commerce Department said it was changing an export rule to \"strategically target Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S. software and technology.\" The company has for months been in the crosshairs of a broader U.S.-China trade battle and the latest announcement is likely to take a toll on the globe's second-largest smartphone maker. \u2014 Franck\n\n7:30 am: Stock futures point to Friday losses", "author": ["Thomas Franck Yun Li Jesse Pound", "Thomas Franck", "Yun Li", "Jesse Pound"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/when-will-we-get-haircuts-again.html", "published": "2020-05-15T22:43:29", "title": "When will we get haircuts again? Beauty experts weigh in on the future of self care", "text": "Rachel Ford Hutman is embracing a more natural style a few months into the pandemic Source: Rachel Ford Hutman\n\nRachel Ford Hutman, a California blonde for years, is now embracing a more natural look. After shelter-in-place was declared in San Diego to stem the spread of Covid-19, she tried to use a coloring spray to cover her roots but it was an unmitigated disaster. Now, she's liking the lived-in ombr\u00e9 look with natural-colored roots, which she hopes will save her money and frequent trips to a hair salon. \"With the last financial crisis, the first thing I cut was Starbucks,\" said Ford Hutman, who works in public relations. \"I'm thinking that any way to save now is a good thing.\" Across the U.S., people are taking creative approaches to their beauty regimens. Couples are watching YouTube videos before cutting each other's hair. Kids are trimming their parents' bangs so they don't cover their faces on Zoom videos. And a so-called \"black market\" for beauty has emerged in some states that are still hunkering down. Beauty workers, many of whom are still unemployed, are doing their best to adapt. Many say they are fielding messages from their former clients about how to manage their hair on their own, and are sending self-care packages in the mail. San Francisco-based stylist Tylor Johnson is taking advantage of the time at home to work on a new product line for blondes, as well as a blog with tips and tricks for hair maintenance. She's also taking online education classes that will help her with her new business. San Diego's Betsy Smith is providing beauty advice through Instagram and YouTube. Some of her clients, like Ford Hutman, are purchasing gift cards for future use, and Smith will donate some of the proceeds to a local charity. She's making ends meet by saving as best she can, and she feels fortunate that she still has some money coming in from a cosmetology school where she worked as an instructor (the school is shut down, but continues to pay her in the short-term). She feels fortunate, as some of her colleagues in the industry are struggling far more than she is. Many stylists, she says, are financially strapped but are nervous about going back to work once their state reopens as there's a lot of fear that they could be exposed to the virus. \"Half are ready to go back to work and the other half are very cautious,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHair stylist Betsy Smith at home Source: Zach J Smith\n\nHow salons will change\n\nJohnson, who works at the Culture of Hair salon in San Francisco's Financial District, specializes in coloring for blondes. She is just one of thousands in the beauty industry who are unable to work until the state starts to reopen. Even once that happens, Johnson expects that she'll take on a reduced client load to maintain social distancing. She expects that many salons will avoid blowouts altogether, or styles that involve super close contact, to reduce the risk of transmission. Clients will also likely sit more than six feet apart in the waiting rooms, and there might not be magazines to sift through. Large salons like Supercuts say they have consulted with public health professionals, and are now requiring their stylists to wear CDC-recommended face masks during their entire shift. They are also expected to wash their hands frequently and sanitize anything that touches a client, including the gowns. In some states where salons are already starting to reopen, including Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana, these precautions and more are in place. In other states, such as California, New York and Michigan, personal care services providers are still awaiting instructions on when they can reopen for business. Once they do, customers might expect longer wait times, as salons will have to take in clients at much lower volumes. Salons might also try to raise prices to recoup some of their lost revenues.\n\nThe rise of self grooming\n\nSelf-administering a haircut is no easy feat, and social media is filled with horror stories. But some say they've had success turning to instructional videos for guidance. YouTube is now filled with videos featuring beauty experts talking through how to embrace roots, cut bangs or to trim split ends with a steady hand. Some are even coloring their significant others' hair in the sink, or taking turns giving each other haircuts. Kids are also proving to be uniquely gifted helpers, and some parents say it's a great way to bond. Venture investor Lisa Suennen said her 24-year-old daughter Maddy helped her dye her roots after her hairdresser mixed her color and delivered a DIY package. \"We laughed like crazy during the process, which was the best part,\" she said. Buzzcuts and shaves are also seeing a resurgence. After a few months at home, Brooklyn-based health-tech entrepreneur Nikhil Krishnan decided it was the right moment to give himself a mohawk. \"I needed to shave because my hair was getting really long,\" he told me. Once he got started, he thought it would fun to document the experience with his friends. That quickly escalated, as he figured his parents might get a kick out of his edgy new style (they \"cracked up,\" he said). \"I had always want to change my hair up into something, and this seemed like the best time to try something new.\"\n\nNew styles\n\nSmith, the stylist in San Diego, is preparing for a resurgence of styles that \"free women from their highlights,\" alleviating the need for frequent root touch-ups. One of her favorite looks is \"grombre\" or \"grey ombr\u00e9,\" where women grow out their natural silver but leave in their lighter ends. Johnson, who's in San Francisco, also expects to see a resurgence of styles like the dip dye ombr\u00e9 look, which involves blending color into the ends with no harsh lines. It's no coincidence, she says, that ombr\u00e9 came into fashion with the great recession of the late 2000s. When consumers are feeling money-conscious and concerned about their financial prospects, they'll often opt for styles that require less upkeep. \"I think a lot of people after this will be happy with how healthy their hair feels,\" said Johnson, noting that many of her clients haven't had a touch up in three to four months. \"So it'll bring back a natural looking hair color.\"\n\nA tough year ahead for salons\n\nHair stylist Tyler Johnson Source: Samantha Lapidus", "author": ["Christina Farr"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/weekend-reads.html", "published": "2020-05-16T14:35:18", "title": "Health officials issue dire warnings; FBI scrutinizes senators' stock sales: This week's recap and best reads", "text": "Jackie Guarneri of Hudson enjoyed beers with friends at Jonesy's Local Bar on the first day of the bar reopening in Hudson. Bars, restaurants and everything else is reopening in Wisconsin after the state Supreme Court struck down the state's stay-at-home order Thursday May 14, 2020 in Hudson, Wisconsin.\n\nTop health officials spent the week issuing dire warnings about the threat the coronavirus pandemic still poses to the United States, even as states continued to ease stay-at-home orders.\n\n\n\nWhite House health advisor Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Tuesday that reopening too soon without widespread testing and contact tracing could result in new outbreaks that cause needless suffering and death.\n\nFauci had to testify for the Senate hearing via videoconference from quarantine after he was exposed to a White House aide who tested positive for the virus, raising questions about social-distancing protocols in the West Wing.\n\nThe following day, President Donald Trump dismissed Fauci's warnings as unacceptable. That evening, the Wisconsin Supreme Court brushed aside health officials concerns and overturned the state's stay-at-home order as unlawful, ruling in favor of a lawsuit filed by the Republican lawmakers. Hours later, crowds were drinking at bars without face masks.\n\nOusted federal vaccine scientist Dr. Rick Bright used more even dire language than Fauci when he warned Congress that the coronavirus pandemic could prove more devastating than the 1918 flu, which killed at least 50 million people globally, and said the U.S. risked \"the darkest winter in modern history\" if the nation's leaders didn't mount a better response.\n\nTesla also reopened its car plant in Fremont in defiance health orders by local authorities and faced a police inspection.

Economists were expecting closer to a 12% decline.\n\nThe figure put into focus the virus' ongoing impact on U.S. economic data, market analysts said following the report.\n\nHere's what three of them, including CNBC's Jim Cramer, are watching now:\n\nJan Kniffen, CEO of J Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the pandemic has simply accelerated trends that were already changing the face of retail:\n\n\"The point is it was really bad, we knew it would be bad, and we know what wasn't selling. What wasn't selling was all of those stores that were closed because the government said, 'You have to be closed,' and people didn't want to really go to them anyway \u2026 and they didn't really want to go to restaurants even if the restaurants had been open. What we've just seen, though, is the worst month. It's going to be better in May because everything's starting to reopen in some parts of the country. The numbers will get better. Most of those stores are opening at about 55% of what they would've done the same time last year. So, that's a real number. And that tells you just how tough it is that you can't get them back in the store yet. That number will gradually rise and will be at 70%, 65% before we get to holiday, and then, if we're lucky, we'll be in the 90% range by the time we get into the holiday selling season. So, ... this number we just saw was terrible, but nobody thought it could be anything but terrible. However, we do know that pajama sales were up 150%. What does that tell you? \u2026 We've had a lot of retailers already file [for bankruptcy], and we're going to have thousands and thousands of stores that only reopen long enough to go out of business. So, that was already happening. We knew there was going to be shakeout in this industry. This started way back when. Gee, [in] 2014 I was on your show saying we're going to see 50% of non-bar, non-retail sales online by 2030. Now, it's going to be by 2025. I was saying we'll see 10,000 stores a year close for the next 10 years. Now, we're going to see 50,000 stores close this year. It's all just being accelerated by Covid. But there's no surprising things going on here. The retailers that were struggling are continuing to struggle, and they're just struggling harder now because cash flow went to zero for a lot of them. That's never happened before in the history of retailing. If you were down 10% in a recession, it was a big deal. Now it's gone to zero for some long period of time \u2013 six weeks, eight weeks, whatever \u2013 and even when you come back, your cash flow's going to 50, 60% of what it normally was. You can't make a living there, so, you continue to see people fail even once we start to put the stores back together. This is just an acceleration of the trend. We're going to go online; We already knew that. We're going to go digital; We already knew that. We're going to go to cashless payments; We already knew that. It's just going to come a lot faster since Covid is pushing that so hard with the consumer because now the consumer also doesn't feel safe. They don't just want convenience now, they want convenience and safety, and that's harder to deliver and it's expensive to deliver. So, the cost structure's also going to get worse for all these retailers as they have to do all of these things to make the consumer feel more comfortable.\"\n\nCramer, the host of \"Mad Money,\" said the government's distinction between essential and nonessential businesses has unfairly weighed on some consumer-facing companies:\n\n\"What can I say? There is just a really horrible distinction between essential and nonessential. \u2026 We were talking with Planet Fitness last night. When they made liquor essential and gyms nonessential, it wiped out a lot of gyms. And so what's going to happen is there'll only [be] one strong gym. All these numbers just point to the same stocks doing well: Costco, Home Depot and Lowe's, recommended this morning, obviously Amazon and, yes, Walmart. Target's doing well. But everybody else is doing poorly. There was an amazing article today about how FedEx is cutting back hours of the ones that are most hurt. \u2026 There's only going to be a couple places for us to go.\"\n\nJeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Capital Wealth Planning, said this downturn may not end up being \"that big a deal.\"\n\n\"I do think there's huge, pent-up demand out there. I mean, we haven't been able to go out to restaurants for five or six weeks. \u2026 I said on CNBC and I've written in my letter the past two weeks that the market's in for a rough spot right here. My models don't tell me how low it's going to go, but, again, I don't think the lows that we made a couple months ago are going to be retested because I think you're going to get a pretty strong pickup in earnings in the back half of this year and I think you're going to get a pretty strong pickup in economic activity in the back half of this year. And there's a ton of cash on the sidelines, and if you talk to the retail investors, they're still scared to death. And that's not the way market blow-off highs are made. So, I think we're still in a secular bull market. Secular bull markets last 15 to 20 years. I think we've got five to 10 years left in this one, and very few people believe that.\"\n\nDisclaimer", "author": ["Lizzy Gurdus"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/china-asks-united-states-to-stop-unreasonable-suppression-of-huawei.html", "published": "2020-05-16T10:20:07", "title": "China asks United States to stop 'unreasonable suppression' of Huawei", "text": "A logo is pictured on a Huawei NetEngine 8000 Intelligent Metro Router during a 5G event in London, on February 20, 2020.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said on Saturday the United States needed to stop the \"unreasonable suppression\" of Chinese companies like Huawei.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday moved to block global chip supplies to blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, spurring fears of Chinese retaliation and hammering shares of U.S. producers of chipmaking equipment.\n\nChina will firmly defend its companies' legal rights, the foreign ministry said in a statement in response to Reuters' questions on whether Beijing would take retaliatory measures against the United States.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/saudi-sovereign-fund-discloses-stakes-in-citi-boeing-facebook.html", "published": "2020-05-16T09:29:31", "title": "Saudi sovereign fund discloses stakes in Citi, Boeing, Facebook", "text": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C.\n\nSaudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has purchased minority stakes in major U.S. companies including Boeing, Facebook and Citigroup, according to a U.S. regulatory filing.\n\nPIF disclosed a $713.7 million stake in Boeing, around $522 million in Citigroup, a $522 million stake in Facebook, a $495.8 million stake in Disney and a $487.6 million stake in Bank of America, the Securities and Exchange filing on Friday showed.

Covid-19 Cases Still On Rise!\" at the entrance of the Atlanta Beltline near Piedmont Park as the coronavirus pandemic continues on May 11, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nCertainty is always more abundant than accuracy on Wall Street. Well argued, data laden hypotheses support opinions that drive buyers and sellers.\n\nA high-profile money manager and fellow talking head, Mr. I. M. Sureofmyself, was describing his view of how the economic and health care crisis would develop and unfold over the next six to 12 months. He offered an articulate, rational, clear vision of the path ahead.\n\nHe argued that cash and bonds are unattractive asset classes in today's environment. He says that in response to Covid-19, the Federal Reserve and federal government have so dramatically suppressed interest rates and ballooned the money supply that inflation will soon return with a vengeance. When that happens, he says, investors will be better off owning growth stocks, for instance, that can at least somewhat protect against the expected surge in inflation.\n\nIt sounds an awful lot like he is advocating that we pile into the very same stocks that massively outperformed 1) throughout the longest bull market in history from March 2009, through early this year; 2) during this year's Covid-19 sell-off (S&P 500 fell 34% from peak to trough); and 3) during the rebound from that sell-off (+26% from the low).\n\nTo me, he doesn't really sound like he is advocating a strategy of \"buy low.\" And in stark contrast to another legend by the name of Warren Buffett, whose company is currently carrying well in excess of $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet, I.M. seems to be largely ignoring the significant risks associated with this severe recession as well as the lofty valuations associated with said \"growth stocks.\"\n\nNow, you may have also heard other professional money managers talk about the risk of a deflationary spiral. They may have said that notwithstanding the massive job losses and business shutdowns, Covid-19 is likely to have a far bigger impact on aggregate demand than aggregate supply. In other words, the economy will be running at significant excess capacity (i.e., the economy is producing more than it can sell). And as we all know from Econ 101, if demand falls faster than supply then prices will not rise, as Mr. Sureofmyself suggests, they will fall.\n\nThat great minds can so disagree is unsettling. Who is right? Either of these outcomes seems plausible. And it's possible we could have deflationary pressures in the near- to intermediate term, followed by inflationary pressures thereafter. The point is that the path of our economic evolution is not preordained and is difficult to predict with much precision. As such, it is tempting but perilous to embrace a path with such conviction at a time when the future is inherently unknowable. Economists John Kay and Mervyn King describe this in their eponymous new book, \"Radical Uncertainty.\" Author Brene Brown suggests that vulnerability is an uncomfortable, unwelcome constant and should be recognized and incorporated into healthy psyches.\n\n\n\nHonest investors need to invest for a future that may have any number of outcomes. Investing weighs risk and reward and is a constantly evolving process. Designing portfolios for a prescribed path is straightforward; for example if interest rates are headed higher, sell dividend payers and bonds. If they are headed lower, buy them. But designing portfolios for any number of inherently unknowable outcomes is not straightforward. It requires a flexible process that can change based on changes in the investment backdrop. By definition, it will almost certainly be imperfect (unless you get crazy lucky). My goal as the steward for many families and institutions is an investment allocation that will endure market struggles, enjoy market gains and should produce solid, long-term results.\n\nStrong balance sheets with limited debt, lots of cash, low dependence on the capital markets, good cash flow and the ability to operate and earn are the core of my pandemic portfolio.\n\nBecause investors must also be opportunistic, I also seek stocks that are selling at significant discounts to intrinsic value because of an unfairly perceived vulnerability. Because I'm conservative and risk-averse, the airlines and hospitality sectors, for example, are outside of my comfort zone right now. There are investors that will place wagers on which airlines will survive, and some will have stellar returns. Yet there are others that will lose bitterly as businesses fail to continue as going concerns. We do not venture into the thin branches of risk. Will there come a time when there is more clarity in the airline and hospitality sectors and an investment opportunity arises that meets our criteria? Perhaps, but we are far too early in this crisis to make that sort of determination.\n\nRecognizing and accepting the \"radical uncertainty\" of the unknown is much harder than following a specific prescription or dogma. But it is often the only honest response.\n\nUnderstanding that outcomes are unknowable helps set reasonable expectations and avoids surprised, panicked disappointment. Keep your wits. Have a plan. Know that we are all vulnerable, but history argues that the long-term expansion in the U.S. economy drives stock prices higher. Longer periods mitigate and buffer short-term volatility. Invest with a disciplined, dispassionate plan and have confidence that the republic and U.S. economy will survive and thrive again.\n\nMichael Farr is the founder, president, and CEO of Farr, Miller & Washington Investment Counsel.", "author": ["Michael K.

Google Earth\n\nThe largest public companies that tapped the government's emergency relief fund for small businesses nearly all had ready access to other forms of capital, according to a CNBC analysis of filings. Even amid the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic, these companies raised millions of dollars by selling stock or had idle credit lines they could've used, factors that likely should've prompted them to return loans they got from the federal Paycheck Protection Program. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned of \"severe consequences\" for companies that shouldn't have participated in the program. But just hours before a May 14 deadline to return PPP loans with amnesty, most public companies made no mention of giving back the funds, which become grants if used for approved expenses like payroll. Of the $1.32 billion tapped by public companies across 407 loans, only 61 loans making up a combined $411 million are being returned, according to data analytics firm FactSquared.\n\nOne example: Cutera, a California-based maker of devices like laser-powered hair removers, raised more than $26 million last month by selling shares on the open market, according to filings. It had also applied for a PPP loan days before the Treasury Department had explicitly discouraged public companies with access to the capital markets from doing so. Cutera received the money from stock sales on April 21, the very same day that its application for a $7.1 million PPP loan came through. On top of that, the company had $19.5 million in cash and liquid investments as of March 30, and an untouched $25 million credit line from Wells Fargo to fund its operations. Cutera, run in part by San Francisco-based hedge fund manager Daniel Plants, is just one example of dozens of PPP applicants found by CNBC that were large and established enough to have relationships with bankers and sophisticated investors.\n\nAfter the initial $350 billion round of the small business relief fund was quickly disbursed, a backlash grew against companies including Shake Shack and Ruth's Hospitality Group that had tapped the fund despite having other options. Those two companies returned the money, and were eventually followed by other firms with well-known consumer brands like AutoNation. But many public companies have so far escaped scrutiny because they aren't household names. CNBC found 49 companies with a market capitalization of at least $100 million that took PPP loans and hadn't disclosed plans to return the money as of May 12. Of those firms, 13 sold shares this year, and many of the rest had unused credit lines good for tens of millions of dollars in borrowing power, according to filings. Last month, the Small Business Administration issued guidance in response to the public uproar over the loans, saying that it was unlikely that a \"a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets\" could make a good-faith certification that it needed the PPP funds. The agency gave companies two weeks to return the money if they suspected they may no longer qualify, and later extended the deadline to May 14. On May 13, Treasury issued an updated FAQ saying that PPP loans under $2 million would likely not be examined and that the deadline to return funds was moved yet again to May 18. \"The purpose of this program was not social welfare for big business,\" Mnuchin told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on April 28, adding that the government would audit PPP loans over $2 million to make sure they were valid. \"The purpose of this program was to help small businesses.\" Many of the companies found by CNBC are in the technology, health tech and pharmaceutical sectors, which are often the types of businesses that need to regularly sell stock to fund operations while developing new products.\n\nOne example is OncoCyte, which develops early detection cancer tests. The California-based company secured a $1.14 million PPP loan through Silicon Valley Bank on April 23. The next day, it filed a prospectus to issue shares, and ultimately raised $10.75 million last month from stock sales. Another is Xeris Pharmaceuticals, a maker of diabetes medication, which reaped $39.9 million from share sales in February. The Chicago-based company got $5.1 million from the PPP on April 22, and later decided to return $900,000 of that, keeping the rest for payroll and other expenses, the firm said. Applied Optoelectronics, a Texas-based maker of fiber-optic networking products, is another company that has ready access to capital markets. The company had $28.8 million in unused borrowing lines and $62.5 million in cash and liquid securities as of March 31, as well as a deal with Raymond James to sell $55 million in shares. Despite its solid financial footing, the firm applied for a $6.2 million PPP loan through Truist Bank, which it got April 17. In a May filing, the company said that despite the latest SBA guidelines, it still believed it met \"all the requirements\" for the program but that the loan could subject it to \"additional scrutiny which could adversely affect our financial condition.\"\n\nSteven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury secretary, center, walks through the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Sunday, March 22, 2020.

Charles Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in an earnings release the broker saw \"monumental volumes\" of trading from the 609,000 new broker accounts added in the first quarter, with over 280,000 in March alone. The quarter included 27 of the 30 highest volume days in Schwab's history.\n\nTD Ameritrade \u2014 which is set to be acquired by Schwab \u2014 said last month that retail clients opened a record 608,000 new funded accounts in the first quarter, with more than two-thirds of those opened in March. The e-broker's new accounts proved to \"skew younger\" over the last quarter,\" TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan told CNBC. \"Perhaps because they're home or perhaps because of furloughs, they also have time to dedicate to their investments that they didn't necessarily have before,\" Kinahan added. ETrade, which is set to be acquired by Morgan Stanley, saw a gain of 363,000 accounts in the quarter, a company record. \"I think a lot of the innovation around trading commissions has really driven the accessibility of the markets for everyone and clearly that cohort, the younger ones, are seeing it for the first time in the headlines everyday, 'massive market drop,' so the combination of current events, innovation of trading and technology have really driven this whole movement,\" Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC.\n\nRobinhood users soar\n\nRobinhood \u2014 millennial favored stock trading app \u2014 saw a mind-blowing 3 million new accounts in the first quarter, despite glitches and crashes on heavy trading volume days. \"The access to trading, there are no barriers to entry anymore, its on your phone, you can buy whatever you want, fractional shares are available so if you can't pony up $1,400 to buy one shares of Google you can still own the FANG stocks,\" Welsh added.\n\nStock positions at the Silicon Valley start-up have nearly tripled since the end of last year. With the major inflow of new market participants, the market chugged higher, led by the companies young people know and love.\n\nNarrow, tech-led rally\n\nAll three major averages have joined the marker comeback, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is in the green for the year. The technology darlings that have carried the market over much of the last decade \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet \u2014 are leading stocks out of the coronavirus trenches. Shares of Netflix are up 36% and Amazon is up 30% this year.\n\nWall Street is skeptical if this rebound is the real start to the next bull market, given its narrowness. Some analysts are confident stocks will retest their lows when the full economic picture is realized. TD Ameritrade investors \"have been doing a pretty good job choosing technology stocks,\" said Kinahan. \"In this last month, Apple was one of the stocks that stood out in terms of millennial clients compared to our overall client base and Apple performed pretty well in that time frame.\" \"You saw Microsoft, some of the banks, Disney, as the big ones in that time frame. These companies that tend to sit on cash, said Kinahan. TD Ameritrade clients also picked some beaten down oil stocks. Investor newbies are also piling into the beaten down airlines and cruise lines, according to Robintracker, which tracks Robinhood account activity but is not affiliated with the company. Market participants have increased positions in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Air lines, Carnival Cruises and Norwegian Cruise lines the most of any stocks in the past month. \"In the height in March of things that were going very poorly, our millennial clients led the way buying Carnival cruise lines and at the time people are like 'oh my God, how can they do that?' Yet, they went and saw the opportunity where many of perhaps our older clients did not necessarily see that opportunity when the stock was trading sub $8,\" Kinahan added. Michael Krause, chief investment officer at Counterpoint Mutual Funds, said this strategy may not be a safe long term bet. \"Traders here are 'buying the dip' in a lot of names with questionable fundamentals now, i.e. airlines, highly volatile stocks, low in recent price momentum, and ones with that have recently (in the last 3 months) had lottery ticket like upside payoffs occur,\" added Krause. \"Robinhood investors are making all the classic mistakes in the short term.

The Los Angeles-based space start-up conducted a series of tests in December using a 3D-printed tank, which the company increasingly pressurized until it burst. \"It's a pretty big deal to show that the materials actually work and the manufacturing process actually works,\" Relativity CEO Tim Ellis told CNBC on Monday. Ellis explained that \"the point is to figure out what pressure the vessel actually holds.\" While the tank was a fifth the size of the one that will be used for Relativity's Terran 1 rocket, it was structurally representative of the pressures and stress that it would undergo during a launch.\n\nRelativity co-founder and CTO Jordan Noone stands next to one of the company's Stargate 3D printers. Relativity\n\nThe burst pressurization tests helped the company verify its ambitious 3D-printing approach to building rockets, as well as the materials it's using. Ellis said the tank burst at about \"10% more than the requirements with the safety factor\" needed for a launch. \"It's definitely sufficient for the whole launch vehicle,\" Ellis said, adding that \"we've got two years to keep making it better.\"\n\nRelativity growing despite coronavirus crisis\n\nRelativity's rocket development is still on track for its first launch in 2021, Ellis noted, despite the coronavirus pandemic that's begun causing delays within the space industry. While the company's rocket engine test program has been \"delayed the most,\" due to NASA's Stennis center largely shutting down, Ellis said that overall Relativity has been able to continue moving forward. That's in large part because of Relativity's unique approach to manufacturing. \"There's just fewer processes and way fewer supply chain steps, because almost everything is made from very limited raw materials, like our whole rocket structure. All of the engine and the other auxiliary structure components are made from just two raw materials, so it's a very simple supply chain,\" Ellis said. Additionally, Ellis said Relativity is \"in a really good cash position\" to weather the crisis, given that it raised $140 million in October. Relativity's investors include Social Capital, Playground Global, Y Combinator, Bond Capital, Jared Leto and Mark Cuban. \"We are not planning any layoffs and are actually accelerating our hiring,\" Ellis said. \"We've actually done well over a dozen either new hires or on boarding people remotely via Zoom during this time.\" His company began telling the majority of its workforce of more than 150 employees to stay home the first week of March. But the company has been able to keep development moving forward, as Ellis said Relativity has had all four its \"Stargate\" printers running during this time. \"We have one person per building operating printers right now,\" Ellis said. Relativity in February secured a new headquarters in Long Beach, California, which Ellis said most of the company will be moved into by the end of July, with \"the whole facility operational by the end of this year.\"\n\nRelativity co-founder and CEO Tim Ellis stands next to a 3D printed part of the company's Terran 1 rocket, with two of the Stargate printers visible in the foreground.

This seems paradoxical given the economic toll \u2014 to say nothing of the emotional toll \u2014 on millions of people across the country without a job. While some say this is further indication that the stock market has become decoupled from reality, others say there are clear reasons why stocks have rebounded, and can continue to move higher. For one, the jobs data in and of itself is backward-looking. The April figures \u2014 which saw a record 20.5 million Americans lose their job \u2014 is from the height of the crisis. Since then, economies have begun to reopen. There is still a long way to go, of course, but the market is discounting what's going to happen six months from now, when most states will be getting back to business.\n\nStrategists also point out that the losses have been somewhat concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sector, whose underperformance has overshadowed strength in other areas of the market. And with the government and federal reserve providing record stimulus measures, some argue that once businesses do get back up and running, the recovery will be swift.\n\nThe S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all opened higher on Friday, with the Dow surging more than 300 points. Since the March 23 low, all three averages have bounced more than 30%.\n\nWorst over?\n\nWhile the debate among health experts about how and when economies should reopen is ongoing, some states have already started easing shelter-in-place measures. A number of states including Florida began phase one reopenings on Monday. California became the latest state to lift some of its precautionary measures, with certain low-risk retailers allowed to open beginning Friday. \"The market knows that the job losses are self-inflicted due to the widespread shutdowns,\" Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar told CNBC. \"Thus, now that we are beginning the reopening process the market assumes many of these people will hopefully get hired back over the coming months and quarters.\"\n\nAdditionally, 78% of those who lost their job in April said they were furloughed, meaning the unemployment in theory will be temporary. Goldman strategist Jan Hatzius said this is an important distinction to make, given that it suggests the recovery will be swifter. \"If job losses are concentrated in this segment [furlough], it would increase the scope for a more rapid labor market recovery when the economy eventually rebounds (because employees can be recalled to their previous jobs, as in several past recessions),\" he wrote in a note to clients ahead of the report.\n\nPockets of strength?\n\nAt first the market sell-off was broad in nature as the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus sent the major averages tumbling into a bear market at the fastest pace on record. But since then, the divide between the winners and losers widened. Unsurprisingly stocks most exposed to the coronavirus threat \u2014 including hotels and airlines \u2014 have continued to trade lower. But other names are showing strength. On Thursday the Nasdaq went positive for the year, as names like Netflix and Amazon surged to all-time highs. \"Large companies have fallen much less than smaller companies. It is likely that as a result of this crisis the strong will get stronger ... and so the stock market is reflecting that in its relative valuation,\" Peter Orszag, Financial Advisory CEO at Lazard and former OMB director under Obama, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"The US consumer has proven to be the economic engine over the last decade, and investors who are buying heavily into this market believe that behavioral changes are unlikely to create a dislocation in demand longer than a couple of quarters,\" added Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth. That said, Saccocia said a more cautious tone is warranted, since she believes it's a \"misconception\" that demand for consumer services will return quickly once government edicts lift.\n\nOngoing stimulus?\n\nAs the coronavirus wreaked havoc on markets, governments and central banks around the world stepped in in an effort to prop up prices. In March, President Donald Trump signed into law a record $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act, while the Federal Reserve announced that it would engage in unlimited asset purchases. \"While the collapse in economic activity is historic, so too is the global policy response to cushion the impact and support a recovery as containment measures are relaxed,\" JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a recent note to clients. \"We estimate the impact of Fed easing in both rates and credit more than compensate for the temporary hit to corporate earnings when valuing the US market via discounted earnings,\" he added.\n\nZero rates?\n\nAs part of its stimulus measures, the Federal Reserve in March slashed interest rates to near zero. At the central bank's most recent meeting at the end of April, it pledged to keep rates at historic lows until the economy recovers. This supports economic activity since it makes borrowing money cheaper. \"Interest rates are going to be extremely low -- barely positive -- for a very long period of time, so that does provide some support to equity prices,\" noted Orszag.\n\nLooking forward", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/bitcoin-btc-cryptocurrency-prices-rise-as-halving-approaches.html", "published": "2020-05-08T06:45:03", "title": "Cryptocurrency market jumps by over $13 billion driven by bitcoin as major technical event approaches", "text": "Mehmet Ali Ozcan | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nA rally in bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report an increased interest from institutional investors. Bitcoin crossed $10,000 on Friday morning Singapore time, the first time it has hit that price since February, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency had pared some of those gains and was trading around $9,900.75 as of 1:39 p.m. Singapore time, still representing a more than 6.4% rise from the day before. The entire market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market had jumped by more than $13 billion from the day before, as of around 1:39 p.m. Singapore time. That move had been largely driven by bitcoin which makes up most of that figure. The value of the entire market stood at $268.07 billion.\n\nIndustry participants said that a number of factors \u2014 from supportive central bank monetary policy to increased interest from institutional investors \u2014 has factored into the bitcoin rally. Bitcoin suffered two bouts of intense selling in March sending it to a low of around $3,867, a price not seen since March 2019. Since then, the price has rallied over 150%. Meanwhile, stock markets, which also saw sharp drops in March, have recovered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March low. \"Overall markets have been bullish since the March lows and this is across asset classes, including crypto,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Money printing by the Fed and other central banks globally have given a lot of confidence to investors that the economy will be supported no matter what.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe 'halving'\n\nPart of the rise in bitcoin's price since the March low has been anticipation of a technical event known as \"halving.\" Bitcoin is not issued by a centralized authority like fiat currencies are. That is why it is often called a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency. Instead it is governed by code and is underpinned by a technology known as blockchain. In the world of bitcoin, so-called miners with specialized high-powered computers compete with each other to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever \"wins\" this race gets rewarded in newly minted bitcoin. This \"mining\" activity happens in blocks, which is essentially a group of transactions joined into one. Currently, these miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per block mined. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. On May 12, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoin. The effect is that the supply of bitcoin coming onto the market is reduced. Previous halving events, which happen every four years, have preceded big price increases in bitcoin.\n\n\"For the past few weeks, we have seen additional players enter the BTC market as prices have trended upward in anticipation of the halving event as bulls saw this as an opportunity to buy BTC ahead of a price pop and what many expect will be significant price appreciation,\" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a bitcoin index fund provider, told CNBC. BTC refers to bitcoin's currency code like USD for the U.S. dollar. \"This has undoubtedly continued into this week and may even carry over the weekend as the halving draws closer.\"\n\nInstitutional buying?\n\nDibb said there are other factors at play as well, including more institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, a high-profile Wall Street hedge fund manager, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. \"The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin\u2014publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC's sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone,\" Dibb said. \"With monetary easing policies and 'unlimited' economic stimuli being recently unveiled across the world, fiat currencies seem set to weaken substantially. This has, in turn, led to bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' to gain added traction amongst investors who are seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets.\" Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a so-called safe haven asset during turbulent times for other risky assets like stock markets. However, recently, bitcoin has fallen and risen when stock markets have.\n\nFlashbacks to 2017?", "author": ["Arjun Kharpal"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/bubble-stocks-like-beyond-meat-and-peloton-were-supposed-to-blow-up-but-the-opposite-happened.html", "published": "2020-05-08T12:37:07", "title": "'Bubble' stocks like Beyond Meat and Peloton were supposed to blow up, but the opposite happened", "text": "Peloton machine Source: Peloton\n\nMany on Wall Street were convinced the usual playbook would occur when this market and economic downturn hit.

In fact, Beyond Meat, Tesla and Peloton all fell more severely than the S&P 500 during the rapid plunge. \"Several of these stocks did get hit hard initially,\" said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \"It was only after the worst was over that people came running back into those names.\" \"Once investors saw that the Fed was going to provide a strong safety net, they came back into the market, but they still wanted to weight their holdings towards those that would actually benefit from the lockdown,\" Maley said.\n\n'Cult of personality'\n\nTesla is a different story. The stock had a massive run earlier this year, driven by analysts upping price targets and short covering by those who bet against Elon Musk's automaker. Many were worried Tesla might be a speculative bubble that sometimes occurs near the end of bull markets. \"Tesla is its own cult of personality,\" said Dan Nathan, principal of RiskReversal Advisors. \"When the history books are written on this period of the stock market, this is going to be a big asterisk.\" Shares of Tesla surged more than 40% in the past month, boosted by strong quarterly results with better-than-expected deliveries even amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGetting crowded again", "author": ["Yun Li"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/cargo-carriers-are-reaping-the-rewards-of-the-coronavirus-slowdown-in-air-travel.html", "published": "2020-05-07T22:01:11", "title": "Cargo carriers reap rewards of coronavirus chaos", "text": "A Boeing 747 cargo freighter belonging to the Atlas Air flies into the clouds after lifting off from Hong Kong International Airport, on 23 October 2017, in Hong Kong, Hong Kong.\n\nNot all airlines are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic. Cargo carriers are cashing in on the rush for medical supplies and other goods, marking a reversal of fortunes for the sector on the heels of its worst year in a decade.\n\nAs passenger demand plunged while Covid-19 spread around the globe, airlines have stored about two-thirds of the world's fleet of about 26,000 planes through mid-April, according to U.K.-based aviation consulting firm Ascend by Cirium.\n\nThat meant a crunch for space because passenger planes routinely carry everything from mail to fresh food to pharmaceuticals in aircraft bellies.\n\nAir freight volumes worldwide dropped by more than 15% in March from a year earlier, but capacity dropped 23%, the International Air Transport Association said.\n\nSome cargo carriers are reaping the benefits.\n\nAtlas Air Worldwide Holdings on Thursday said it swung to a $23.4 million profit in the first quarter from a loss of nearly $30 million in the same period a year ago. Executives were upbeat about strong demand in the second quarter. Shares of the cargo airline that flies for Amazon and others gained 8.6% and have gained 50% in the second quarter.\n\nThe company said in a statement that it expects adjusted net income in the second quarter to rise as much as 50% from the first quarter. It also announced an agreement with its pilots for 10% interim pay increases, after a protracted battle with their labor union.\n\nAir Transport Services Group, another Amazon contractor that also offers passenger charters, on Tuesday reported a nearly 12% increase in revenue in the first quarter from a year earlier. ATSG posted net income of $133.7 million for the first quarter, compared with $22.6 million in the first three months of 2019, according to FactSet. Its stock fell slightly Thursday but is up more than 17% in the second quarter so far.\n\nThe results are a stark contrast to the four biggest U.S. passenger airlines, which last month posted their first quarterly losses in years as U.S. travel demand dropped more than 90%, a result of the virus and measures to keep it at bay, like shelter-in-place orders.\n\nUnited's stock is down by 28% since the end of March, Delta is off 24%, Southwest has fallen 28% and American is down 22%.\n\nThose airlines, however, have quickly moved to operate cargo-only flights facing a dearth of passengers.

Jeena Moon | Reuters\n\nWith one-third of S&P 500 companies declining to provide guidance, picking winners and losers has become a delicate business. How can anyone possibly figure out what's going to happen to earnings when the companies themselves have admitted they don't know? Regardless, one of the defining characteristics of stock investors is that ignorance of the future has never stopped them from making bets \u2014 big bets, in some cases. The last few weeks have seen many unusual flows into exchange-traded funds that offer an insight into what those bets look like. Here are some broader themes:\n\nIs this the bottom?\n\nHow many times have you heard this story? Despite the worst possible outlook, some investors are trying to call bottoms in beaten-up industries like energy and airlines Shares outstanding in the S&P 500 Energy ETF, for example, have increased 45% since the beginning of April. It's even wilder for U.S. Global JETS ETF, a basket of mostly American airlines. Shares outstanding have gone from 1.5 million at the end of March to north of 40 million shares.\n\nThe winners will keep winning\n\nGold diggers\n\nA smaller but equally enthusiastic groupis continuing to pour money into gold ETFs. Call them the doom-and-gloomers: those who believe gold is a haven in uncertain times. Investment demand for gold is way up even as jewelry demand in China and India, the two largest jewelry markets in the world, is down. Shares outstanding in the largest ETF that holds gold directly, SPDR Gold Trust, are at their highest level since 2013, even as gold prices also hit a seven-year high, swelling the value of the fund to over $50 billion. Shares in competitor iShares Gold Trust have also skyrocketed.\n\nInto the US, out of everywhere else\n\nAnother noticeable trend: into America, out of Europe and Asia. There have been outflows in the largest European ETFs, including Vanguard FTSE Europe, SPDR EuroSTOXX 50, iShares MSCI Eurozone and iShares Core MSCI EAFE. The picture in emerging markets is a bit more nuanced, but in general there have been outflows from the larger funds as well, including Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, said it was no surprise investors were reducing exposure to areas with significant China influence. \"With expectations that China and other historically fast growing markets experiencing the same pain as the US, investors have chosen to reduce their risk profile,\" he wrote to me.\n\nWhat's it all mean?", "author": ["Bob Pisani"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/this-breakdown-of-retail-sales-data-shows-why-amazon-is-leading-the-stock-market.html", "published": "2020-05-15T20:12:19", "title": "This breakdown of retail sales data shows why Amazon is leading the stock market", "text": "\"In typical Internet fashion, a winner-take-most model played out with Amazon now accounting for 40% of US [gross merchandise volume],\" Bernstein analysts said Friday in a note to clients. Benstein pointed to Amazon's large production selection, lower prices, and reliable delivery as factors that will make it a \"clear beneficiary of eCommerce acceleration.\"\n\nOther retailers are also seeing a bounce in online orders, but Amazon's market share, as well as the one-stop-shop nature of the site, means it's often the first choice for consumers.\n\nIncluded in this category, which saw an 8.4% month-over-month increase, is online shopping. With much of the country under shelter-in-place orders during April, consumers increasingly turned towards e-commerce giants like Amazon for their shopping needs.\n\nAs the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March, shares of the Seattle-based company initially moved lower, but since then the stock has recovered \u2014 and then some. Amazon hit an all-time intraday high of $2,475 on April 30, and shares have gained nearly 30% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 11.7% decline.\n\nIn the first quarter, Amazon said that net sales jumped 26% year over year to $75.5 billion as people flocked to its site. The volume was so high that the company temporarily halted delivery for non-essential items while hiring 175,000 additional workers to keep up with the heightened demand.\n\n\"Amazon loyalists leaned so heavily into this channel that they broke it \u2013 with the company pivoting away from non-essential deliveries and hiring 175K more workers to keep up. Walmart and Target loyalists did the same thing to those retailers' nascent digital channels,\" Bernstein added.\n\nAmazon is not the only retailer seeing a spike in online sales. On April 23 Target said digital sales were up 275% month-to-date, while Best Buy said in an April business update that domestic online sales jumped 250%. Wayfair, Shopify and Overstock.com are among the other online retails that have reported rising sales.\n\nLooking to capitalize on the digital sales surge, Walmart announced on April 30 that it was rolling out its Express Delivery service. The company accelerated the development of the service in an effort to meet growing demand for delivery, while also announcing plans to hire an additional 200,000 people.\n\nWhile all of these companies have seen a jump in sales, their market share of the digital shopping sphere lags Amazon by a significant amount. Amazon makes up roughly 40% of the market while Walmart, the second largest player, occupies around 5% of the market, according to eMarketer.\n\nShares of Walmart are up about 4% for the year while Target has slid 5%. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), which tracks the sector, has dropped more than 20%.\n\nAmazon expects the jump in sales during the pandemic to lead to longer-term gains. For the second quarter, the company said it expects net sales to come in between $75 billion and $81 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 18% and 28%.\n\n\"We believe that the long term steepening of Amazon's growth curve driven by the acceleration of consumer adoption of ecommerce and enterprise adoption in cloud computing, enabled by the company's investments in fulfillment and infrastructure, and the associated high returns are likely to drive significant share price outperformance well beyond the current crisis,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said following the company's first quarter results.", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/jim-cramer-plant-based-meat-is-a-trend-investors-should-not-ignore.html", "published": "2020-05-06T16:35:17", "title": "Cramer says the plant-based meat 'movement is happening' and investors better 'get on the bus'", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday that investors cannot ignore the rising popularity of plant-based meat products.\n\n\"This movement is happening.

This is not blockbuster drug, but watch this trend,\" Cramer said. \"I think it's very exciting for investors.\"\n\nShares of Beyond Meat were up about 17% on Wednesday morning to around $118 each.\n\nBeyond Meat, at a $7.2 billion market value, has been at times one of Wall Street's hottest stocks but also one of the most volatile since its May 2019 initial public offering. Priced at $25 per share, the stock saw a meteoric rise to nearly $240 by last July. But come December, it had lost about 70% of its value. In the early part of this year, the stock rebounded before falling off a cliff, bottoming at about $48 in mid-March. Since then, the stock has more than doubled.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, in addition to strong revenue, Beyond Meat posted quarterly net income of $1.8 million, up from a net loss of more than $6 million last year. It did warn of a hit to its restaurant business due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, the \"Mad Money\" host said he believes the plant-based meat industry may ultimately be beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nMeatpacking plants across the U.S. have seen significant virus outbreaks, forcing some to slow down production or temporarily close as workers became sick. The developments ignited concerns about the country's food supply, although President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week requiring the plants to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I think there are people who are getting appalled by what's happened at the meat packers. ... I think these stories make you become not necessarily vegetarian but to think twice about beef,\" Cramer said. \"If you think twice about beef and then you try to Beyond, you kind of realize it's very, very similar.\"\n\nWhile plant-based meat options have typically been more expensive than traditional meat, Cramer said the rising costs of beef, in particular, due to the coronavirus represents an opportunity for alternative producers.\n\nOne of Beyond Meat's chief rivals in the plant-based meat category, Impossible Foods, is not publicly traded. But it is widely available as well. Grocery store chain Kroger also has launched private-label beef options.\n\nCramer noted that food giant such as Nestle have entered the plant-based burger market.

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.\n\nIt raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below 1.\u201d\n\nThe slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.\n\nA likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.\n\nThe figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.\n\nIt comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply.\n\nSome epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.\n\nThere is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as \u201cfrankly, madness\u201d.\n\nThe leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to \u201cstay at home\u201d would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough.\n\nHow do models calculate the R value?\n\nThe R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially; below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there.\n\nSome models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off.\n\nDeaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are.\n\nPolicy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.\n\nSome models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more \u201cnoisy\u201d and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.\n\nHow sure are we about regional differences?\n\nAlmost all available data and models suggest there are strong regional differences in terms of the number of infections and current transmission rates. Serology surveys suggest that more than 10% of people in London have been infected with Covid-19, compared with around 4% in the rest of the country. In general, urban centres have had more infections than rural areas.\n\nThe data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.\n\nThis is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily.\n\nMatt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHE/Cambridge estimate for London as \u201cextremely low\u201d. His own team\u2019s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.\n\n\u201cThis still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic \u2026 The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat are the reasons for regional differences?\n\nInitially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.\n\nThere are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that there\u2019s loads of immunity in the community, then that\u2019s brilliant, but I don\u2019t think we should plan for that scenario,\u201d said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know yet.\u201d\n\nThere are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to 1.\n\nDifferences in living arrangements \u2013 for instance, larger family groups living together outside London \u2013 could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.\n\nIs there evidence that people in some regions have complied less with the lockdown?\n\nThere isn\u2019t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.\n\n\u201cThe uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,\u201d said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. \u201cI thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.\u201d\n\nDo the models suggest restrictions should be eased regionally?\n\nThis is an emerging view among scientists. \u201cBased on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,\u201d said House. \u201cThere\u2019s no point locking down if there\u2019s no cases to prevent.\u201d However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,\u201d said Riley. \u201cI suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.\u201d", "author": ["Hannah Devlin"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/how-coronavirus-spreads-in-restaurant-video", "published": "2020-05-15T18:22:34", "title": "Dying to go out to eat?

However, the regional governments of Madrid and Catalonia have been publishing their own figures on people who have died in care homes from the virus, or while exhibiting symptoms consistent with it.\n\nIn Madrid, the total for Covid, or suspected Covid, deaths since 8 March stood at 5,886 on Thursday. In Catalonia, it was 3,375. Between them, care home deaths in the two regions account for more than a third of all the coronavirus deaths in the country.\n\nItaly\n\nDeaths from coronavirus in Italy\u2019s care homes came to light only when newspapers started to report on the issue in early April.\n\nThe prime focus was on a care home in Milan, which had more than 1,000 residents and where there was an unusual increase in deaths in March. An investigation began, and care home officials found that 300 residents had died between January and April.\n\nOf the 900 residents still in the home, 34% were positive for Covid-19. Italy\u2019s higher health institute found that between 1 February and 17 April there had been 6,773 deaths across all care homes, 40% of which were due to Covid-19.\n\nUnited States\n\nOne of the first US coronavirus cases was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Washington state in late January. By late March, the US outbreak was centred around one care home, the Life Care Centre of Kirkland in King County, where more than three-quarters of residents fell ill and 40 people died. Staff who worked multiple jobs unwittingly carried the virus to other care homes in the area.\n\n\n\nFor a variety of reasons \u2013 including the US\u2019s privatised healthcare system, pre-existing problems with infection-control in America\u2019s care homes, a lack of federal leadership on the pandemic and the varying rate of spread of the virus across other states \u2013 lessons from King County have not been learned.\n\nResidents of nursing homes have accounted for a staggering proportion of Covid-19 deaths in the US, where more than 85,000 people have died.

The findings show women from a BAME background were four times more likely to be hospitalised with coronavirus than white women.\n\nThe study suggests that for pregnant women, being from a BAME background is a stronger predictor of the likelihood of being hospitalised with coronavirus than age and obesity.\n\nThe \u201ctroubling\u201d data prompted the Royal College of Midwives (RCM) to develop new guidance for midwives and maternity support workers to ensure that they are aware of the increased risks for BAME women and that there is a lower threshold for investigating symptoms and advising them on whether they need to be seen by a medical professional.\n\nThe impact of the coronavirus has shone a light on longstanding maternal health disparities, experts said. The study follows findings from an inquiry published last year, which showed that black women were five times more likely to die from complications surrounding pregnancy and childbirth than white women, while Asian women were twice as likely to die.\n\nThe RCM has also launched a targeted campaign to raise awareness of the increased risk to BAME women and reassure pregnant mothers that help is available.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ve known for some time that there are big disparities in maternal health according to ethnicity,\u201d Prof Marian Knight, the lead researcher of the study at Oxford University, said, \u201cbut what is surprising is the extent of the imbalance. More than half of the women who were admitted with Covid-19 in pregnancy were from BAME group, which is very different from the whole birth population as whole.\u201d\n\nKnight explained that when the study took into account whether women had other medical problems, were older, or overweight, the racial disparities remained. The racial difference still showed up when researchers excluded data from women who were from London, the West Midlands, and the north-west, where rates of coronavirus are higher.\n\nThe study analysed data of 427 pregnant women and has not yet been peer-reviewed.\n\nThe findings showed that about one in 10 pregnant women admitted to hospital in the UK with coronavirus required respiratory support in a critical care setting, a figure reflective of the general population. One in 20 of the babies born to mothers admitted to hospital subsequently had a positive test for Covid-19; of these, half had infection diagnosed on samples taken less than 12 hours after birth.\n\nOverall, five women who were admitted and had a positive test for coronavirus had died.

During two years of social distancing on a farm he came up with important new mathematical insights and started formulating his theory of gravity.\n\nMy own quarantine experience has largely consisted of attempting to complete Netflix. However, last week I decided to channel Newton and conduct some scientific experiments of my own. I stood in my local New York park counting passers-by to see if there were any gender differences in mask-wearing. Please don\u2019t judge me: at least I didn\u2019t spend my spare time starting a podcast.\n\nThe results of my study, A Sociological Park-Based Meta-Analysis of Gendered Mask Habits (due to be published in the Journal of Arwa\u2019s Thoughts) were unequivocal. Men were just as likely to wear masks as women. In face-coverings, at least, we had achieved gender equality!\n\nIt is with a great deal of disappointment, then, that I must announce that my findings have been refuted by a rather more robust study. A new survey of 2,459 people living in the US has found that men are less likely to don face masks because they believe wearing one is \u201cshameful,\u201d \u201ca sign of weakness,\u201d and \u201cnot cool.\u201d\n\nThe survey, conducted by American and British researchers, also found that men are less likely to believe they\u2019ll be significantly impacted by Covid-19 than women. Which is ironic, because there is a huge amount of evidence showing that men are much more likely to die from coronavirus. Researchers are still trying to figure out whether this is due to biology or behaviour.\n\nInterestingly, the study found gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering basically disappeared in places were masks were made mandatory. In other words: men need to be forced to wear masks more than women do. You\u2019re obliged to wear face coverings whenever you can\u2019t socially distance in New York, which explains why I didn\u2019t notice any gender differences in my own study. So I won\u2019t give up hope of a Nobel prize for science quite yet.\n\nThe fact that a significant number of men (including Donald Trump) think masks make them look weak is yet another reminder of how damaging gender stereotypes are. The pressure to seem tough doesn\u2019t just prevent men from wearing masks, it prevents them from expressing their emotions and seeking help for mental health problems. It\u2019s one reason that men are 3.5 times more likely to die from suicide than women. Reluctance to show any sign of weakness also factors into why men don\u2019t go to the doctor as much as women do and why they\u2019re less likely to adopt preventative health measures. Toxic masculinity kills.\n\nMasks aren\u2019t particularly fun to wear, but they work. One recent research paper found that if 80% of Americans wore masks, Covid-19 infections rates would drop to approximately one twelfth the number of infections. So if you\u2019re a dude who is still fretting about face coverings I encourage you to think: What Would Newton Do? I\u2019m pretty sure he would wear a mask.\n\nAfghan hospital attackers \u2018came to kill the mothers\u2019\n\nA group of barbaric cowards entered a maternity hospital in Kabul \u201cwith the purpose of killing mothers in cold blood,\u201d the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has said. 24 people, mainly new mothers, died in the attack. 18 babies were left motherless. It\u2019s still not clear who is responsible but it is tragically apparent that two decades of war in Afghanistan has not done much for women\u2019s rights. As a CNN op-ed by Anushay Hossain notes, the US government has long exploited the plight of Afghan women to win the PR battle for the war. Thanks to US intervention, Laura Bush said in 2001, Afghan women were \u201cno longer imprisoned in their homes.\u201d But, says Hossain: \u201cHere we are, almost two decades later, with Afghan women and their babies being slaughtered. If they\u2019re not safe in maternity wards, how safe are they in their homes, or anywhere in the country?\u201d\n\nTrailblazing woman at center of US trans rights case dies aged 59\n\nAimee Stephens died at home on Tuesday after suffering complications of kidney disease; her wife was by her side.

Ancient world, that sort of thing? It\u2019s so difficult to tell with a man who wears his learning as lightly as the prime minister does. But we must ask after a distressing \u2013 and distressingly well-sourced \u2013 report in the Financial Times suggesting that the reason senior Tories want all MPs to return to sitting in parliament like, yesterday, is because they feel their man does better when he\u2019s backed up at the dispatch box by the only set of cheerleaders in the world you wouldn\u2019t want to have sex with (I\u2019m very slightly paraphrasing their comments). Poor prime minister. I believe the same thing happened in the Athenian agora to Socrates, who came across as a stuttering haystack unless he was supported by serried ranks of inadequates screaming \u201cno, YOU are!\u201d at his debating opponents.\n\nAnyway, given that Johnson is our Churchill \u2013 the insurance dog version \u2013 perhaps it was inevitable that he would need a few nodding dogs on the frontbench next to him. All governments seek to disguise their own shortcomings, which is also why this one refuses to countenance a Brexit extension despite the vast economic shock of the coronavirus. Far from taking pause, the Conservatives are embracing the timing with the sweaty gratitude of a guy who knows that the unfortunate fire at a storage unit facility will take care of the corpse he\u2019s been storing there.\n\nFor now, Johnson\u2019s chief danger zone seems to be his weekly encounters with Labour leader Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions. Like me, you probably don\u2019t watch this show on the regular, but I was stuck with it this Wednesday, having exhausted almost all other forms of TV content during the lockdown. First impressions \u2013 and no spoilers please, if you\u2019re ahead of me on the boxset \u2013 is that the House of Commons now has all the atmosphere of the Emirates, but in a good way. It leaves those at the dispatch box with nowhere to hide, which will reflexively discomfit a prime minister who has never entered a bedroom without first checking if there\u2019s a wardrobe.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s only right to include the opposing view from the senior No 10 adviser whose judgment was \u201cKeir Starmer is the one who was rattled.\u201d There is, of course, no objective reality, so by all means feel free to get behind this version, where forensic answerer Johnson made light work of the former director of public prosecutions. It does, however, seem more likely that the opposite version is believed by some, given that not one but three Conservative MPs on Thursday shared a far-right video that used fakery to attempt to discredit Starmer. Well done, Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan, and Maria Caulfield, who eventually deleted their tweets but were in all cases too small and wet to apologise. As health minister, Nadine won\u2019t have a lot on at the moment, so who can blame her for passing the time sharing far-right content on the old Twitter website? But I\u2019d urge her to use it to look into the possibility of simply no-platforming Starmer if she is upset by the things he\u2019s saying.\n\nAs for Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s idea that parliament should \u201cset an example\u201d to the nation by returning to work before the test, trace and isolate infrastructure has been set up \u2026 it\u2019s one way of looking at it. A lot of people say they now watch all TV dramas and have moments where they catch themselves thinking that the characters aren\u2019t socially distancing. I\u2019m not quite there yet. But given that two MPs have already ended up fighting for their lives in intensive care units, I do think that were I to watch a prime minister\u2019s questions done in the old style, my mind would promptly slow it down to the speed of one of those science videos showing how a sneeze travels.\n\nPicture it now \u2013 the great clouds of microscopic droplets being atomised as Iain Duncan Smith turns up his volume again. The strings of mucus arcing gracefully through the air in balletic accompaniment to an absolutely vital interjection concerning this or that honourable gentleman.

The ability to watch in real time London\u2019s R rate rising to nine in the cause of Rees-Mogg being able to bray \u201cfrit, sir!\u201d at a female shadow minister. Too important not to be worth it, surely.\n\nOnce they\u2019d finished, I\u2019d like the chamber cleared, the electric lights switched off, some ultraviolet lights switched on, and Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to go around, CSI style, pointing at the various stains and trace fluids spattered across the green benches, like a Jackson Pollock work entitled The Spread of Democracy.

We need more nuanced debate | Joshua Craze and Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti", "text": "The argument over lockdown seems to have crystallized into a simple \u2013 and simplistic \u2013 binary: health versus the economy. If you position yourself on the left, you value health over money, and so support the lockdown. That\u2019s a mistake.\n\nA 'small-town' pharmacist in Manhattan, a couple married for 44 years: the US health workers who died from Covid-19 Read more\n\nThe \u201chealth versus the economy\u201d frame ignores how disastrous the lockdown has been to America\u2019s poor. Despite rhetoric about \u201cshared sacrifice\u201d, the ability to self-isolate is overwhelmingly correlated to income. While middle-class professionals congratulate themselves for staying inside, their isolation is dependent on a class of workers who often labor without essential equipment or while ill. Making matters worse, these exposed workers also tend to have more of the health conditions \u2013 including hypertension and diabetes \u2013 that make Covid-19 so deadly. In America, getting sick is a class condition.\n\nThis pandemic is an X-ray, exposing the racial and class inequalities of our society. Look at the data on the communities that are hardest hit by the virus. New York City is often described as the \u201ccenter of the pandemic\u201d, but a map of the most affected areas clearly shows that poorer neighborhoods are bearing the brunt. In Chicago, 70 of the first 100 Covid-19 victims were black; Milwaukee tells a similar story.\n\nTo make matters worse, the government\u2019s measures to mitigate the economic effects of Covid-19 lockdowns exacerbate previously existing inequalities. Trump\u2019s much-vaunted bailout has created a multitrillion-dollar money supply for the largest corporations in the country, with almost no critical oversight requirements. At the same time, people whose livelihoods are being destroyed are being asked to make do with a one-off $1,200 payment, the conditions for which exclude many of those who need it most.\n\nThis amounts to a massive transfer of wealth from the poor to the rich. Just like in 2008, capital has taken hold of the crisis, and turned it to its own advantage.\n\nYet at this stage simply lifting the lockdown to get the economy going would do more harm than good. The lockdown has generated its own crisis. Immediately lifting the lockdown would risk exacerbating the damage already suffered by America\u2019s poorest.\n\nIn April, at least 20 million people filed for unemployment. The sectors most affected by these job losses \u2013 those predicated on face-to-face interaction \u2013 are overwhelmingly peopled by precariously employed, low-paid laborers who have little in the way of savings or capacity to weather this catastrophe. The lockdown thus doubly damns the poor: most likely to be made ill at work, they are also most likely to lose their jobs.\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean it makes sense to rush people back to work in unsafe conditions that might lead to a new spike of infections. Many workers are rightly scared of returning to workplaces that do not properly ensure their safety. Given the intense competition that is likely to emerge over the few jobs that remain in America, many big employers may create a \u201crace to be bottom\u201d that forces workers to compete to accept dangerous working conditions.\n\nTaking the class and racial consequences of this crisis seriously means thinking more carefully about how we \u201creopen\u201d the economy.\n\nOne way to do this would have been a program of contact tracing, aimed at identifying, isolating and taking care of those who actually have the disease (or are most vulnerable to it), while allowing others to keep the economy going. Such a program was successfully undertaken in South Korea. Unfortunately, it may already be too late for this approach. In any event, Trump\u2019s Republican base would never tolerate what they view as a violation of privacy.\n\nThe strategy adopted by some northern European countries \u2013 such as Sweden \u2013 was another possibility. Keeping the economy going, while offering quality healthcare and other benefits to those who get sick, is less irrational than it might seem. That approach involves less economic disruption. Whether it leads to more deaths in the long run is still an open question. The problem is that the Swedish model pre-supposes a well-functioning healthcare system, whereas American healthcare has suffered decades of contraction under the brunt of neoliberal policies; South Korea has three times as many hospital beds per 1,000 people as the US does.\n\nNeither the Swedish nor South Korean models are possible in America today, and neither resolve the true crisis that the US faces, which is dealing with the disaster caused by the lockdown. Rather than insisting on staying at home, the left should argue for implementing an end to the lockdown that actually answers the demands of the workers striking at Amazon, Checkers, Instacart, and elsewhere for safe working conditions and worker\u2019s rights.\n\nA recent bill proposed by senators Sanders, Harris and Markey \u2013 which includes expanded unemployment insurance and the waiving of all student loan payments during the crisis \u2013 is a good start. But more must be done to address the structural inequalities that have made the coronavirus so deadly in the first place.\n\nUniversal healthcare and a complete overhaul of working conditions and unemployment benefits must be part of any comprehensive strategy for economic recovery. So is a massive public investment program that doesn\u2019t just focus on propping up the stock market, but actually creates long-lasting and well-paid jobs.\n\nThe objections that were routinely raised against such proposals before the Covid-19 emergency centered on the difficulty of financing such programs. But if the way we have responded to the crisis has taught us anything, it\u2019s that the money can be found when there\u2019s a political will for it. It\u2019s just a question of who we want it to benefit.", "author": ["Joshua Craze", "Carlo Invernizzi-Accetti"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/however-obedient-its-citizens-are-the-government-cant-help-but-revert-to-thuggish-type", "published": "2020-05-16T18:00:36", "title": "However obedient its citizens are, the government can't help but revert to thuggish type", "text": "T\n\nhe most shocking feature of the lockdown is not that it is fraying but that it has held at all. If you had listened to rightwing moralists, you would never have believed collective self-discipline was possible. For decades, they have lamented the decline in deference. In her first speech as leader of Conservative party, Margaret Thatcher saw liberal leftists as rats who \u201cgnaw away at our national self-respect\u201d. By debunking the glories of British history, and undermining religious and educational standards, they were turning the British into a rootless mob unable to act in its own or the national interest.\n\nLeftwing moralists reached the same conclusion but took a different road to hell. Capitalism turned citizens into consumers, who thought only of themselves. \u201cA market society automatically carries with it an undermining of solidarity,\u201d declared Noam Chomsky. It generates selfish individualists, unable to stick together. In our day, liberals have explained away Brexit, Trump and populism by citing the willingness of tens of millions to listen to idiot demagogues rather than the educated.\n\nAnd yet here we are, shorn of most traditional beliefs, the undoubted products of consumer capitalism, and still more or less sticking together and obeying the medical elite. I could go on in the style of George Orwell or JB Priestley at their sentimental worst and praise British decency. Although it exists in millions \u2013 whoever thought that it did not? \u2013 surely the reason why the British and so many other populations are obedient is that they are terrified. The only way the authorities can begin to clear up the mess they have made of this crisis is by understanding our fears and showing us how to improvise ways round them. Unfortunately, they show no sign of doing it.\n\nI should emphasise that the fear is a fear of the virus, not of the government. At the start of the crisis, many warned of the creation of a police state. They had every reason to be alarmed. Ministers had ordered the population to stay at home, as if it were an invading army imposing a curfew. Their emergency regulations allowed the police and public health officials to detain, test and interrogate everyone they thought might be infectious, and force them into quarantine if required. We were, in the words of the former supreme court judge Lord Sumption, losing our freedom in a fit of \u201ccollective hysteria\u201d.\n\nA police state requires police officers willing to enforce a dictatorship. The police aren\u2019t prepared to do it\n\nAs it has turned out, the hysteria has been on Sumption\u2019s side of the argument. A police state requires police officers willing to enforce a dictatorship. The police aren\u2019t prepared to do it. Nor has the Johnson government asked them to, for whatever faults the hopeless man has, he\u2019s not a dictator in the making. Correct me if I have missed them, but I can find no reports of officers herding the sick into quarantine. The police in England and Wales have merely issued about 9,000 fines for breaking the lockdown \u2013 usually to young people out in public spaces without reasonable excuse. I don\u2019t want to underestimate how the determination to protect the old by denying education and social life to the young will haunt this country for decades. But to put the punishments into perspective, the French police had issued 915,000 fines for breaking the lockdown as of 23 April \u2013 100 times as many. You can either believe that the English and Welsh are 100 times more law-abiding than the French or that chief constables have, on the whole, trusted the public to behave sensibly if given a little leeway. If there had been a determined effort by even 10% of the population to break the lockdown, it would never had held. As it is, people have done what was asked of them, more or less.\n\nHaving denigrated their fellow citizens for decades, moralists have seized on the solidarity. Rather than realising that people were hiding from a terrifying plague, Tories decided the nation was rallying round the flag and seeing Johnson as a new Churchill. From the other side, I have heard leftists bend the Tory line for their own purposes and assure me we are witnessing the public sacrificing its freedom for the sake of the NHS. The peak of the self-congratulation came in early May when the BBC ran a propaganda series, Our Finest Hours. It would show \u201chow the outbreak of Covid-19 has revived our nation\u2019s wartime spirit and once again we can be proud to be British,\u201d the tastelessly upbeat narrator told viewers. \u201cNow, as we did in World War Two, we are uniting in a common endeavour.\u201d\n\nSceptics could counter with the revelations of the unforgivable failure, not just of Johnson but also of the government\u2019s scientific advisers, to lock down soon enough. They might point to NHS managers\u2019 willingness to send infected patients into care homes and to threaten doctors who spoke out about the shortages of protective equipment. Not much common endeavour to be proud of there.\n\nRealists would do better to return to what matters above all else: the fear. There may never be a vaccine. Even if there is and it is available to all \u2013 a big if \u2013 the virus may mutate. We will need new ways of living with the fear outside lockdown. Indeed, we need them now. Yet, instead of explaining to people how they can safely travel and work, the government is reverting to its thuggish type. It is picking fights with teachers\u2019 unions asking reasonable questions about how schools can reopen. Instead of realising that the cooperation of the mayor of London is essential if the capital is to reopen, it goes for him because he\u2019s Labour and a remainer and therefore an enemy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the government is gnawing away at national self-respect, to use Thatcher\u2019s words. If it can\u2019t find the authority and patience to convince the public to overcome its fears, it will gnaw away at the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist", "author": ["Nick Cohen"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-antidote-your-favourite-reads-beyond-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-15T07:29:39", "title": "The antidote: your favourite reads beyond coronavirus", "text": "If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by coverage of the pandemic, try this daily list of non-coronavirus articles our readers spent the most time with\n\n\u2018You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges.

Brushing aside their own fears and anxieties over the contagion, staff at the home continued to care for the residents. Still, the virus charted a deadly course, killing at least 17 of the 133 people living there.\n\nThis pandemic shows older people are the forgotten ones of our society \u2013 they don't deserve to leave the world this way Maria Branyas\n\nCovid-19 left Branyas \u2013 who has lived through the 1918 flu, two world wars and Spain\u2019s civil war \u2013 sick for just a handful of days.

A similar story has played out across Europe with as many as half of all Covid-19 deaths believed to have taken place in care homes in Italy, France, Ireland and Belgium.\n\nIn Spain, where the reverence shown towards the elderly is a point of pride, the pandemic has forced a reckoning with an industry that has long fended off complaints of funding and staff shortages.\n\nBefore the pandemic, seniors had shared stories of waiting hours to go to the bathroom or receive a drink of water. Others had grappled with ant infestations or cockroaches, while staff at one home complained of being forced to ration essential items such as nappies and soap.\n\n\u201cThis is the situation in our care homes \u2013 not during the pandemic but in the last decade,\u201d M\u00e1s Madrid politician Pablo G\u00f3mez Perpiny\u00e0 told the regional assembly last month. \u201cThis is our how elderly have had to face the virus.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maria Branyas at her care home in Spain.\n\nThe horrific situation came to light in March after the military was deployed to disinfect care homes. \u201cThe army found seniors who had been completely abandoned, some dead, in their beds,\u201d the defence minister, Margarita Robles, told broadcaster Telecinco.\n\nProsecutors in Spain said this month that they had opened 140 investigations into care homes, prompted by complaints from family members and relatives. The Federaci\u00f3n Empresarial de la Dependencia, an industry association that represents care homes in Spain, told Spanish broadcaster esRadio that homes had been left to care for residents after overwhelmed hospitals refused to take in more patients or to send care homes the appropriate medications.\n\nSpeaking from the care home where she has lived for nearly two decades, Branyas offered solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s as though those of us who choose to live in a care home have disappeared from society,\u201d she said. \u201cGovernments need to pay attention and provide funding and qualified staff in care homes. And, above all, they need to provide much more healthcare in homes.\u201d\n\nWith the help of an account set up and run by her daughter, Branyas last year made her social media debut \u2013 her Twitter bio reads: \u201cI\u2019m old, very old, but not an idiot\u201d \u2013 after she was recognised by the Gerontology Research Group as Spain\u2019s oldest known living person and believed to be among the 30 oldest people in the world.

Discouraging if you are over 65, yes, but more reassuring if you are contemplating going back to work.\n\nAnd there were zero new Covid-19 cases in New Zealand for three days in a row. Taiwan has gone seven days in a row without an imported case. Denmark is sure there won\u2019t be a second wave. China today marked one month without a Covid-19 death.\n\nMeanwhile, crime has fallen off a cliff in the UK\u2026\n\nWhat we liked\n\nThere were a slew of pieces this week about various European countries moving beyond coal. This Fast Company piece summed the picture up well, while this New York Times article reported that the US will generate more electricity from renewable sources than from coal in 2020.\n\nWe quite like this piece about an Olympic fencer turned delivery driver, if only for the headline\u2026\n\nAnd we were grateful to Giselle Green for singling out our work in her piece this week for journalism.co.uk\n\n\n\nWhat we heard\n\nWe love hearing your theories, lockdown lessons, crazy utopian ideas and blinding answers to life, the universe and everything, so keep them coming.\n\nAlastair Whitson continued our theme of lockdown learnings:\n\nLive in the moment. Enjoy the natural world. Don\u2019t be in a rush. Take the time to talk to strangers. Walk, don\u2019t drive. Shop local. Buy less, give more. And, don\u2019t put up with the bullshit any more. The system is twisted and rotten, so let\u2019s smash it, and rebuild it better!\n\n\n\nDaianna Karaian flagged up her venture called \u201cdo something about the news\u201d, which sounds very much like a perfect cousin for the Upside\n\nEvery Friday, I pick a news story and share one simple thing anyone can do to make the situation better. Topics have ranged from tackling climate change to confronting sexual assault to supporting a free press, to talking to kids about the coronavirus pandemic. Readers say it makes them feel less anxious, provides a sense of control and gives them hope. To share that with the rest of the world, I\u2019ve published a roundup of the best stories and related actions here.\n\nJo Holdaway wrote in to offer up her series of digital illustrations of key workers, entitled SUPER+HUMAN.

From the children\u2019s nurse who has to wear PPE which makes it so much more difficult to communicate with families and children to the police sergeant who can\u2019t comfort his recently bereaved mother because of the risks his job possesses. At the same time we are really appreciating and feeling so thankful for the people within our communities like the postal workers and recycling teams that bring a welcome routine and \u2018life\u2019 to our quiet streets. Because we have been staying at home we have realised that their physical presence and brief conversation is really valued in the community.\n\nWhere was the Upside?\n\nIn a dozen and more countries where people are tiptoeing back to life.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Paris in the spring Photograph: Charles Platiau/Reuters\n\nThanks for reading.

Following her announcement that the charge was being reviewed, we wrote to the home secretary urging action. We await a response and commitment to act on this.\u201d\n\nDr Chaand Nagpaul, the chair of the British Medical Association (BMA) council, told the Independent: \u201cIn the last two months, we\u2019ve seen a huge outpouring of support for our frontline staff, including those talented colleagues who have come to work here from overseas.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sure they would be dismayed to find that the government is continuing to penalise them with this absurd fee during the crisis.\u201d\n\nThe shadow health minister, Justin Madders, said the NHS would collapse without overseas staff and that it was \u201csimply unconscionable\u201d for them to be subject to extra charges.\n\n\u201cMinisters frequently tell us how proud they are of the incredible effort being made by NHS staff yet when they have the opportunity to do something tangible to demonstrate their appreciation they pull the rug up,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Home Office tweeted on Saturday afternoon: \u201cIt is wrong to suggest the home secretary said there would be a formal review into this policy. All government policies are continuously kept under review.\u201d\n\nAfter Patel\u2019s apparent announcement, there were mounting calls for the surcharge to be permanently ditched. It was introduced in 2015 as part of hostile environment laws designed to discourage illegal immigration and combat health tourism. The surcharge must be paid alongside taxes and national insurance contributions.\n\nDr Chandra Kanneganti, the national chair of the British International Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe know BAME doctors are disproportionately getting ill. To have to pay for the same service that they are putting their lives at risk for doesn\u2019t seem fair. This charge needs to be scrapped completely for NHS overseas workers.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office said the surcharge raised about \u00a3900m for the NHS between 2015 and 2018-19. During this time the cost has repeatedly risen and healthcare workers have said they struggled to pay the fees. For other doctors and nurses, the charges are probably a deterrent when they consider coming to the UK.\n\nAt the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing last month, Patel said in response to a detailed question from ITV regarding the surcharge: \u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary said, in light of the exceptional circumstances that coronavirus presents, it is right that policies are kept under review.\n\n\u201cThis includes how the immigration health surcharge applies. For example, the Home Office has already announced free automatic visa extensions for overseas frontline NHS workers who are working to beat the virus, including an exemption from the immigration health surcharge.\u201d", "author": ["Mattha Busby"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/16/kobe-bryant-autopsy-helicopter", "published": "2020-05-16T15:34:22", "title": "Autopsy finds pilot in Kobe Bryant crash had no drugs or alcohol in system", "text": "The pilot flying NBA legend Kobe Bryant and seven others, including his daughter, to a youth basketball tournament did not have alcohol or drugs in his system, and all nine sustained immediately fatal injuries when their helicopter slammed into a hillside outside Los Angeles in January, according to autopsy reports released late on Friday.\n\nThe reports by the Los Angeles county coroner\u2019s office provide a clinical but unvarnished look at the brutality of the crash.\n\nThe Last Dance: Is the Michael Jordan documentary a dressed-up puff piece? Read more\n\nOne of the most popular sports figures in Los Angeles and nationally, and a celebrity around the globe, Bryant was broken beyond recognition when his body was found outside the wreckage of the chopper. His remains had to be identified by his fingerprints, the coroner reported.\n\nThe report made it clear: Bryant and the passengers almost certainly were dead in an instant due to blunt trauma.\n\n\u201cThese injuries are rapidly if not instantly fatal,\u201d wrote Juan Carrillo, senior deputy medical examiner, in Bryant\u2019s report.\n\nThe crash that killed the 41-year-old retired Los Angeles Lakers star, his 13-year-old daughter Gianna \u2013 clad in the jersey she would have worn to play that morning, with the word \u2018Mamba\u2019 on the front and her last name on the back, pilot Ara Zobayan and the others is considered accidental.\n\nBryant was headed from his Orange county home to his daughter\u2019s tournament at his Mamba Sports Academy in Thousand Oaks on the morning of 26 January.\n\nThe group, including one of his daughter\u2019s coaches, and two of her teammates, encountered thick fog in the San Fernando Valley north of Los Angeles.\n\nZobayan, an experienced pilot who often flew Bryant, climbed sharply and had nearly succeeded breaking through the clouds when the craft took an abrupt left turn and plunged into the grassy, oak studded hills below.\n\nWhen it struck the ground, it was flying at about 184mph (296kph) and descending at a rate of more than 4,000 feet per minute. The impact caused a crater and scattered debris over an area the size of a football field in the Calabasas hills. Flames engulfed the wreckage, but burns on the bodies were determined to have occurred after death.\n\nThe autopsy noted Bryant\u2019s tattoo of a crown on his right shoulder, above where his wife\u2019s name, Vanessa, was imprinted. On the lower right arm were the names of three of his four daughters: Bianka Bella, Natalia Diamante and Gianna Maria-Onore, the daughter who died with him.\n\nThe youngest girl, Capri Kobe, was only seven months old when her father died.\n\nThe only drug in Bryant\u2019s system was methylphenidate, which is sold under the brand name Ritalin and used to treat attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and narcolepsy.\n\nThe National Transportation Safety Board has not concluded what caused the crash on the outskirts of Los Angeles county but said there was no sign of mechanical failure in the Sikorsky S-76. A final report is not expected for months.\n\nThe others killed were Orange Coast College baseball coach John Altobelli, his wife, Keri, and their daughter Alyssa; Christina Mauser, who helped Bryant coach his daughter\u2019s basketball team; and Sarah Chester and her daughter Payton.\n\nBryant is the only NBA player to have his team retire two numbers in his honor. He was selected last month for the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame. A ceremony is scheduled for late August though it may be delayed until at least October because of the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\n\nIn February Vanessa Bryant filed a lengthy lawsuit alleging that Zobayan was careless and negligent to fly in the fog and should have aborted the flight. She has also filed a claim, a precursor to a lawsuit, against the Los Angeles county Sheriff\u2019s Department after deputies allegedly shared unauthorized photos of the crash site.\n\nZobayan\u2019s brother, Berge Zobayan, has said in a court filing that Bryant knew the risks of helicopter flying and his survivors aren\u2019t entitled to damages from the pilot\u2019s estate, while the helicopter company, Island Express, says they are not responsible for damages, calling the crash, among other things, \u201can act of God\u201d and \u201can unavoidable accident\u201d that was beyond their control.", "author": ["Associated Press"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/uk-news/2020/may/16/uk-police-fear-explosion-of-violent-as-lockdown-eases", "published": "2020-05-16T16:58:28", "title": "UK police fear explosion of violent crime as lockdown eases", "text": "Attacks are expected to surge as rival drug gangs try to re-establish dominance in county lines\n\nPolice are braced for an explosion of violent crime as gang rivalries and vendettas that have built up during the lockdown erupt onto the streets following the easing of restrictions, analysis by a leading criminologist warns.\n\nDr Simon Harding, director of the National Centre for Gang Research at the University of West London, said the trading of social media taunts and drug feuds that have festered during the restrictions were likely to trigger an \u201cexplosive crimewave\u201d.\n\nDuring the lockdown some gangs expanded their county lines operations and seized rival areas, escalating tensions with competitors who obeyed the government\u2019s stay home measures and suspended trading.\n\nHarding, a former Home Office and Metropolitan police adviser, said: \u201cWe\u2019re going to have the backwash of everything that\u2019s happened over the last two months. There\u2019s a crimewave coming, a tsunami on the way.\n\n\u201cThere\u2019ll be increased rivalry and competition but there will be some amalgamation among county lines gangs, some will join as a business arrangement. It\u2019s been a major shake-up, there will be winners and losers.\u201d\n\nFearing arise in attacks, the Met last week launched 12 new \u201cviolence suppression units\u201d across the capital and identified 250 \u201cmicro-hotspots\u201d as flash points. In addition, 1,000 of London\u2019s most prolific violent offenders are being targeted by the force in an initiative to reduce stabbings.\n\nAlthough recorded violence fell significantly during the lockdown, a number of incidents since Boris Johnson announced an easing of measures last Sunday suggest old tensions have resurfaced.\n\nLast Wednesday, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death in Southwark, south London following a \u201clarge fight\u201d. The following day, coordinated \u201cviolence suppression activity\u201d saw police arrest 70 criminals who had used the UK\u2019s road network during the lockdown.\n\nOutside London, some forces have predicted a return to gang tensions. In Birmingham, there have been warnings of a potential rise in violence after rival groups recruited \u201clow-performing\u201d children while out of school and are now preparing to exploit rising numbers of unemployed youngsters.\n\nHarding also warned that the increasing normality of face masks would assist rising levels of street crime, particularly robberies. \u201cWe are now in a position where legally and socially they can be masked up. Two months ago if someone approached me with a mask I\u2019d either run or evade them somehow. Now that\u2019s not going to happen.\u201d\n\nHarding, whose book County Lines was published this month, said the criminal business model, in which young and vulnerable people were used as couriers to move drugs and cash between cities and smaller towns, was constantly evolving.\n\nGangs in London, he said, had responded to the risk of being charged for trafficking offences when exploiting youngsters as \u201crunners\u201d. Instead they had begun recruiting drug users and in some instances had enticed them, rather than their own members, to inflict violence on rivals.\n\n\u201cAs well as child exploitation we are now seeing exploitation of vulnerable drug users. Some are being used as proxies to commit violence. If I\u2019m a county lines manager and I want somebody taught a lesson then rather than send a boy I can just give two bags of brown to a heroin user to stab them. It\u2019s horrible and manipulative.\u201d\n\nHarding\u2019s book details a series of phenomena about county lines including how disciplined London gangs deal in \u201casymmetric retaliation\u201d, subduing provincial rivals with ferocious acts of violence.\n\nOne county lines manager Harding interviewed claimed to be making \u00a31,000 a day.

A lot of our players went to the same college as Francois, so it\u2019s been hard on everyone within the squad to hear of this tragic news.\n\n\n\n\u201cOn his last game for Harlow, he scored a superb hat-trick to win us the game and walk away with the match ball.

Without buyers and sellers alike booking removal lorries and moving home, large parts of the economy can lose momentum and drag on growth.\n\nThe decision to allow property viewings as part of an easing of the lockdown was seen by ministers as a much-needed boost to commercial life. Over the coming months retailers and wholesalers that supply kitchens, carpets and light fittings will join the army of previously furloughed estate agents in getting a boost.\n\nHoward Archer, chief economic adviser to forecasting group the EY Item Club, describes the move as \u201crelief for the housing market\u201d that \u201cshould allow activity to progressively pick up\u201d over the coming months.\n\nA better outcome \u2013 one that leads to a stronger rebound \u2013 is unlikely, he says. The anxiety surrounding the path of the coronavirus pandemic, and the prospect of thousands of businesses going bust and millions of people becoming unemployed, will keep a lid on the recovery.\n\n\u201cSome people have already lost their jobs, despite the supportive government measures, while others may be worried that they could still end up losing their job once the furlough scheme ends,\u201d he says. \u201cAdditionally, many incomes have been negatively affected. Consumer confidence is currently at or near record low levels on many measures, and many people are likely to remain cautious for some time to come with regards to making major spending decisions such as buying or moving house.\u201d\n\nArcher is one of the more optimistic analysts of the property market, expecting a fall in prices of just 5% over the next few months and a flattening-out by the end of the year. The average house price in the UK was \u00a3230,000 in February, down 0.3% on the previous month, according to the Office for National Statistics. There are much less modest declines to come, say experts.\n\nThe Centre for Economics and Business Research predicts that prices in 2020 will be down 13% \u201cas a lack of transactions, high uncertainty and falling incomes take their toll\u201d.\n\nIn the first weeks of the pandemic, property agency Knight Frank said it anticipated a fall of 3% in 2020 before increasing this forecast to 7% last week. Its analysis suggested prices had fallen 5% since March, with further pain for sellers to come.\n\nSimon Rubinsohn, chief economist at the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (Rics), says: \u201cI suspect people will be fairly wary.\u201d\n\nHe adds that while the easing of restrictions will unlock transactions already in the pipeline and encourage those who need to move for work or family reasons, most people will wait to see how their circumstances develop before buying.\n\nHigh-end property agent Henry Pryor says his clients are looking for 20% discounts, though they are likely to agree on a figure nearer 10%.\n\n\u201cThey don\u2019t know where prices are going to be at the end of the year and whether they will be in negative equity,\u201d he says.\n\nRubinsohn says buyers have also found they may want to consider aspects of a property that were not so important three months ago.\n\n\u201cThey might want to put a garden or balcony higher up their agenda, or put more time into considering the merits of city life versus something more rural,\u201d he says.\n\n\u201cI am not sure we are able to make judgments about which way people are going to jump. It is too early to say. But there is certainly the potential for people to rethink what they want from their next home.\u201d\n\nTrends that were developing before the pandemic hit could be accelerated as the lockdown eases. If commercial properties become less attractive to employers following a shift to home working, a trend to convert empty offices into apartments could pick up pace.\n\nRubinsohn warns that this may not be good news for buyers after a report by academics at University College London for Rics found developers had taken the opportunity of weak planning rules to produce substandard homes that one critic dubbed \u201cthe slums of the future\u201d.\n\nOther trends could reverse. A drift to the city could come to an abrupt end as the prospect of rejoining the morning commuter crush loses its appeal. And the hollowing-out of town centre high streets could be turned around if the prospect of queuing at an out-of-town supermarket is tarnished and buying from local shops is seen as safer.\n\nThe promise of historically low interest rates for the next two years \u2013 and most likely a decade or more \u2013 could underpin this transition, but the route back to a more normal level of transactions will be slow.\n\nArcher says: \u201cVery low borrowing costs should also help matters, with the Bank of England unlikely to lift interest rates from 0.1% until well into 2021. Even so, we expect house price gains to be no more than 2-3% in 2021.\u201d\n\nRubinsohn argues that the government will need to consider tax breaks or subsidies to kickstart the market before housebuilders consider limiting the supply of new homes further.\n\n\u201cWithout help, and especially as unemployment increases, the housing market recovery is going to be slow. It will be a hard slog,\u201d he says.\n\nCase studies of a troubled market\n\nThe buyers\n\nEd Fireman, 54, and his wife Sue, 53, were raring to go when the property market reopened on Wednesday. The couple, who live near Hebden Bridge in West Yorkshire, had an offer accepted on a new home nearby during lockdown, based on a virtual viewing, and were keen to get their place on the market. \u201cWe were straight on the phone to the estate agent \u2013 let\u2019s get moving. But we also have feeling of trepidation because people are talking about a crash,\u201d he says. He has a provisional valuation for his house, based on a video tour he\u2019d given the agent, but she is coming to see it. \u201cWe are talking to her about how this will work \u2013 and what will happen if someone wants to come in.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Ed Fireman, prospective buyer.\n\nThey have seen the house they are buying in real-life now and are very happy. \u201cI think it was the right thing to make an offer when no one else was looking. If there\u2019s a massive crash and we end up having exchanged on it and can\u2019t find a buyer for this one, that will be a problem.\u201d\n\nThe seller\n\nTess Butler, 46, started to try to sell her home in Warminster, Wiltshire, in July last year. She wants to move to nearby Salisbury, where her autistic daughter is at school. \u201cWe had quite a few people through the doors but all I was hearing from the agents was \u2018we need to see what\u2019s happening with the Brexit date\u2019,\u201d she says. Several months, and two estate agents later, things looked better. \u201cThis was in mid-February. My new agent said the market was picking up \u2013 they\u2019d sold 14 houses in a week.\u201d But then came lockdown.\n\nButler works in the tech industry and was keen to offer virtual tours, but her estate agent put staff on furlough and is still closed. She is ready to do viewings, but says agents everywhere will have to manage expectations, given the domestic challenges posed by lockdown: \u201cLike other people we have been properly living in the house for the past couple of months.\u201d And prices are a concern. \u201cI\u2019m selling in an area where prices may go down, and moving somewhere where I don\u2019t think they will.\u201d\n\nThe estate agent\n\nTom Floyd, 33, is sales manager at the Kennington branch of Winkworth in south London. He was doing an online quiz when news that firms could reopen started to filter through \u201cand my phone went mad\u201d.

He said that mice would have been a constant pest in ancient Vindolanda. \u201cWhen the granary buildings at Vindolanda were excavated in 2008, the bones from thousands of dead mice were uncovered below the floors of the buildings where they had been living and feasting on the ears of grain that had dropped between the flagstones into the basements of the buildings,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is perhaps therefore rather wonderful that someone 2,000 years ago made a toy mouse from leather, crafting something to play with from their immediate environment.\u201d\n\nVindolanda\u2019s spectacular finds include famous writing tablets offering insights into the everyday lives of people living and working there 2,000 years ago, rare cavalry swords and the largest collection of boots and shoes to have survived from Roman Britain, among more than 7,000 leather objects and offcuts.\n\nStudying every piece has been painstakingly slow. It is thanks to the coronavirus lockdown that curatorial staff have had the time to focus on the task.\n\nThe mouse had gone unnoticed when it was placed in a bag of scrap leather in 1993. It was among offcuts gathered by archaeologists who were then excavating the commanding officers residence dating to about AD105-130.

I remember going on adventures with my older brother and, when I was 11, being allowed to go to the corner shop alone, and filling up a bag with penny chews, Fruit Salads, Bruiser bars and Black Jacks.\n\nMy parents fostered about 100 children from when I was four onwards. Some stayed for 24 hours and some for 13 years. We were always getting folding chairs out of the garage and budging up to make space at the table or putting another jacket potato in the oven.\n\nMy parents tended to cook big batch food because there was always the possibility that other children would turn up with their carrier bag and shoes and we had to gently bring them out of their shells. One of the big catalysts for that was firstly sitting them at the table and eating with them. Only as an adult do I understand the emotional significance and security of that.\n\nI\u2019d been at the end of my tether as a single mother writing a political blog. Then I became a trainee reporter on the Southend Echo. I can tell you exactly what I ate then at my desk \u2013 pasta with butter and the occasional scotch egg, out of Tupperware. I had basically no money until my first pay cheque came through, but when it did I put some chicken in my pasta. And some cheese, if I was being profligate.\n\nI remember when my mother first took me to a proper hairdresser, instead of having her friend Julie round, or my nan\u2019s friend Lois to trim my fringe at the dining table.

I\u2019d planned to put half back in the fridge.

A most dangerous combination. I stopped \u2013 and I\u2019ve got to be careful how I word this \u2013 basically, I got as far down that path as I wanted to go. I never wished to transition to be a man, I just wanted to knock some of my edges off. The thing about testosterone is that when you stop taking it, you soften back up again, although I\u2019ve still got a few extra hairs on my chin which will never go away. But what that period taught me is that I\u2019m pretty comfortable in this skin as it is.

The teenager\u2019s environmental activism has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg.\n\nMcAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham\u2019s Fingers in the Sparkle Jar which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist\u2019s Asperger\u2019s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer\u2019s day, he writes: \u201cDragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.\u201d Or: \u201cThe valley sings, heaves and rests.\u201d There are original, imaginative descriptions too \u2013 caterpillars move \u201clike slow-motion accordions\u201d and a goshawk chick looks \u201clike an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter\u201d.\n\nHe lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bl\u00e1thnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, R\u00f3is\u00edn, Lorcan and Bl\u00e1thnaid are also autistic; only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as \u201cas close as otters\u201d. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and \u201cpretty formidable, apparently\u201d.\n\nMcAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: Seamus Heaney. \u201cYou can reread his poems again and again\u201d; there are \u201call these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there\u2019s no centre to it. There\u2019s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we\u2019d be too stupid to understand that brain. That\u2019s almost the same as Seamus Heaney\u2019s poems because they have such complex connections.\u201d\n\nTwitter opened my entire world to like-minded people \u2013 you\u2019ll always find someone to talk to about mycelial networks\n\nHe also enjoys reading Ursula K Le Guin, is currently \u201cneck-deep\u201d in his umpteenth rereading of The Lord of the Rings, and is fond of Agatha Christie for her focus on people\u2019s hidden motives. \u201cThat\u2019s been quite important to me because I try my best to learn about humans so I can make acceptable social interactions.\u201d\n\nA teacher once told McAnulty he would never be able to string a paragraph together. He was miserable \u2013 \u201cand miserable is an understatement\u201d \u2013 at a succession of schools, including Oscar Wilde\u2019s alma mater, Portora. The bullying (he didn\u2019t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him.\n\nMcAnulty learned that being in nature helped. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there\u2019s all of those different noises coming from different angles \u2013 my brain can\u2019t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It\u2019s not oppressive.\u201d\n\nHe wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. \u201cOne of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,\u201d he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. \u201cFour years ago I wouldn\u2019t have been able to talk to you right now,\u201d he says. \u201cTwitter opened my world to like-minded people. You\u2019ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It\u2019s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McAnulty with his brother, Lorcan, and sister, Bl\u00e1thnaid\n\nAs McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism \u2013 campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey \u2013 his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on Springwatch and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book.\n\nDiary of a Young Naturalist tells the story of McAnulty\u2019s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called Big Dog. \u201cWhen I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: \u2018I don\u2019t want change.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). \u201cRemoving\u201d himself from Big Dog \u201cwas devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes\u201d \u2013 the mountain range close to his new home \u2013 \u201cand everything became fine again.\u201d Was his recovery as simple as that? \u201cNo, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.\u201d\n\nWriting was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. \u201cAll my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,\u201d says McAnulty. But R\u00f3is\u00edn says she wouldn\u2019t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. \u201cAlthough it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.\u201d\n\nRewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to \u201cre-experience\u201d memories both traumatic and joyful. \u201cI uncovered things about myself along the way. It\u2019s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.\u201d\n\nWe see a problem and we need to fix it. So when politicians seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier\n\nAfter his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. \u201cIt has been the best school I\u2019ve had,\u201d he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but \u201cI have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I\u2019ve had the best luck in the world \u2026 I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.\u201d\n\nMcAnulty plans to take biology \u2013 his first love \u2013 alongside maths, chemistry and politics at A-level. He is currently writing a picture book for younger children and anticipates a career in conservation science. Activism takes up an increasing portion of his time. He runs a project to satellite-tag birds of prey, an eco group at school, and is prominent in his generation\u2019s call for action over the climate and biodiversity crises. Although the British government last year became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050, these are still only words, he believes, and his generation is becoming impatient. \u201cWe see a problem and we need to fix it. So when [politicians] don\u2019t fix it and seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when \u201cthe night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can\u2019t really see the sun\u2019s light but you know it\u2019s just underneath the horizon,\u201d he says. \u201cAt that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That\u2019s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP \u00a316).

Then the world shut down", "text": "It is 7.53am, the last Wednesday in March, and at a courier depot in Athens, the sperm of a Bermudian mechanical engineering student arrives, carried in a nitrogen tank. For the last three days, I have followed the tank\u2019s journey across Europe, loading and reloading the courier website as it made its way from a cryobank in Denmark through Germany to mainland Greece.\n\nThe continent has been shutting down, borders closing as coronavirus spreads, and as the days have passed, the improbability of this delivery, its chances of ever reaching its destination, have seemed increasingly slim.\n\nIt has one final leg, a short hop from Athens to the island of Crete. But today is Greek Independence Day, a national holiday, and so all through Wednesday and long into Thursday the sperm waits at the depot. I call the courier company. All planes being grounded, it will travel to its destination by boat, the handler says brightly. \u201cIt is very urgent,\u201d I tell her. \u201cIt\u2019s for a medical procedure.\u201d She is reassuring but noncommittal. What I do not tell her is that, on Friday, I will have my eggs collected at a fertility clinic on Crete, and it is crucial that the sperm of the engineering student be there to meet them.\n\nMy life has been rich and rewarding, but the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys\n\nUndergoing IVF at any time is a peculiar experience. In the midst of a pandemic, it becomes surreal. In early March, as the world shut down, I imagined my scheduled treatment would be postponed, but to my amazement the clinic said it would proceed. And so one Saturday afternoon, as the virus gathered pace and airports acquired a new and fearful mood, I took one of the last flights from London to Heraklion. I was making this trip alone; my local health authority does not treat single women.\n\nWith its own health system buckled by years of austerity, the Greek government had moved quickly to prevent a coronavirus outbreak of the magnitude of those in Italy or Spain. The evening I arrived, 14 March, Greece was on its way to lockdown, and Heraklion\u2019s shops, bars and restaurants stood newly shuttered. I let myself into my rental apartment, ate the kalitsounia left by my host, and wondered what on earth I was doing.\n\nFor some reason it is always taxi drivers who ask the question, though I imagine they are only voicing what others wonder: \u201cWhy don\u2019t you have children?\u201d I suspect many assume I didn\u2019t want to be a mother, that I was too caught up in my career, that I left it too late. None of this is true. Having multiple miscarriages over many years, for which no medical investigation could find a cause, has been an exhausting, distressing and intensely lonely experience. And though my life has been rich and rewarding in many ways, the absence of a child is a sadness that has gnawed the edges of all other joys.\n\n***\n\nWhen I wake, it is to the sound of wood pigeons, and piano practice, and Sunday church bells. The day is bright and warm, and for some time I wander the city\u2019s empty, sunlit streets. The supermarket is closed, but I find a minimarket to buy a few groceries. Bread, feta, tomatoes. The owner regards me darkly across the counter, locking eyes as he sanitises his hands.\n\nSo far there are only a handful of cases of the virus on the island. Soon there will be the first death: a German professor visiting the university for a conference. There is no room for tourists now. The swingers\u2019 festival has been cancelled; the beaches have closed. They will introduce a mandatory quarantine for new arrivals, close the hotels and the parks. I retreat to the apartment. That night I lie awake, listening to the wind and the cats yowling in the darkness.\n\nI hear IVF clinics around the world are closing, treatments being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with gratitude\n\nThe clinic is a large, grey, modern building not far from the port. It takes 20 minutes to walk there in the rain, a fierce wind whipping in off the water. At the reception desk, I am told to stand behind a line as they fire a thermometer gun at my head, then permit me to ring the fertility centre doorbell. I fold the sleeve of my jumper over my thumb to press the buzzer.\n\nI will admit that I have not read up extensively on IVF. I have taken a strictly need-to-know approach, avoiding online message boards and support groups, spurning offers to bond with friends-of-friends over their own experiences. Each person is different, I have argued, each body is different. Still, as I stand waiting at the door, I realise that this means I have little idea of what to expect.\n\nA foreign clinic is disorienting when you are accustomed to another medical system: the rhythms are subtly different, the smells, the light all wrong. I notice the cigarette smoke on the senior nurse\u2019s breath, the junior who chews gum behind her mask as she draws my blood. Even the tourniquet strapped around my arm feels flimsier than back home. \u201cTake a breath,\u201d the nurse says solemnly, as she inserts the needle. She leaves a small trail of blood along my skin, then dispenses the contents of the large syringe into several containers; a spring-like gurgling sound that I find oddly hopeful.\n\nI walk home along the backstreets, past ageing stucco apartments and the sound of a couple arguing through an open window. When you are not familiar with a culture or a language, your senses become heightened \u2013 the colours louder, the sounds and scents more pronounced. I try to notice the details: the hover of wasps over the bowls of water left out for street cats. A snail on a bright blue wall. The firebug on an orange tree. It stops my mind from spiralling. I stop by the supermarket, where they are already limiting the number of customers, and plastic gloves are mandatory. But the shelves are full and no one is stockpiling.\n\nI am used to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. I know that the grief will come later\n\nThe following day, I return to the clinic. My blood test results have proved heartening and my consultant tells me he hopes for 15 or 16 eggs. He chatters warmly as he performs my ultrasound: about his time living in London in the days of disco, the fact that English women never cook. \u201cI like to cook,\u201d I tell him. \u201cWhat do you cook? Sandwiches?\u201d he asks, then reels off the measurements of my ovaries to his assistant. When I leave, the senior nurse gives me a face mask, ties it tightly so that it covers my nose, and rubs my back with a kind of tenderness. \u201cIt\u2019s for you,\u201d she says. \u201cMake sure you wear it.\u201d\n\nThere is little new I can tell you about IVF medication. The basic protocol is to stimulate the ovaries to produce eggs, which are then removed, fertilised and returned; a further array of drugs help make the pregnancy sustainable. And so for the weeks to come my days are measured out in injections, pills and pessaries, in the fiddliness of mixing powders and solutions, of needles and small glass vials. Soon my stomach is puffy and bruised; my body feels distorted and misshapen.\n\nMeanwhile, I follow news of the pandemic on my laptop. I look at graphs and statistics. I listen to the BBC. Mostly I watch the UK with horror: its slow route to lockdown, the mad rush at the supermarkets, the people who flock to pubs and parks and jostle over toilet roll. There is none of that here. Rather, people move with a kind of quiet obedience. When my flight home is cancelled, I feel something like relief. I feel safe here.\n\nOn 23 March, Greece grounds all flights to the UK and docks all boats to the islands. I can now only leave the house for an hour each day: to buy groceries, seek medical treatment or take exercise, and must first text the government for permission. A strange serenity settles over these days of confinement: I sleep well and long, read, work, take afternoon walks down to the waterfront. I do not return phone calls from well-meaning friends; texts and emails go unanswered. I feel beholden to nothing besides my own body, feed it yoghurt and oranges and sesame snaps. One day I read that IVF clinics around the world are closing, that treatments are being postponed indefinitely, and am filled with a great swell of gratefulness.\n\nI have a talent for choosing unsupportive men who will find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage\n\nWhen I return to the clinic for my second ultrasound, my consultant is in a less jovial mood. He scowls slightly, as if I have disappointed him, tells me the ovarian stimulation has not been as successful as expected; he now hopes for five eggs.\n\nI am accustomed to sitting in doctors\u2019 offices receiving bad news. To be told repeatedly that you have lost your baby, that there is nothing they can do, that your identical twins have no heartbeat, develops a kind of composure. I have learned how to imperceptibly bite my lip, and close my eyes, and know that the grief will come later, far from here, when it will be solitary and wild and flailing.\n\nThat I have done all of this alone is testament to what my friends call my terrible taste in men. I have a particular talent for choosing unsupportive partners, men who will ask you to choose between your baby and them, who will miss hospital appointments, and find commitments more pressing than helping you through a miscarriage.\n\nLast summer, I sat in my GP\u2019s surgery and told her I wanted to pursue solo IVF. I pressed my fingernails into my palm to steady myself as I spoke. She was supportive and kind, and made a referral to the fertility department at the local hospital.\n\nI was not technically single at the time, but two weeks later I left my boyfriend of four years. Some months earlier I had learned that he had cheated on me, constantly, for the entirety of our relationship, including while I was pregnant. I had loved him more than I had loved anybody, and perhaps this was the reason I had tried to make things work, but the days had soon settled into a kind of mute despair.\n\nIt was liberating to feel in charge of my own destiny again, and for the three months while I waited for my first appointment with the fertility clinic, I felt thrillingly alive. When it came, that appointment was dispiriting: the nurse explained my local health authority\u2019s policy on treating single women. She was sympathetic, ordered a range of fertility tests, cautioned against using a donor I knew, and suggested I look at clinics abroad. \u201cGreece,\u201d she said. \u201cThey have some good clinics there.\u201d\n\nThere followed several months of waiting \u2013 for test results, for a round of MMR vaccinations (my GP had no record of my ever having had them). The new year turned and it was almost spring. I told the clinic in Heraklion, chosen for its impressive success rates and peaceful location, that I would come in March. I had not heard of coronavirus then, though already in China the disease was spreading. It seemed very far away. I focused instead on the small, steady world I had created, of fertility acupuncture, sobriety and sperm selection.\n\nIt is easy to get lost in the process of choosing a sperm donor, to dwell upon academic qualifications, professions, favourite pastimes. The more you pay, the more you know: baby photos, adult photos, voice notes, family medical histories. Some cryobanks will supply handwriting samples and outline drawings of your donor\u2019s face in profile; this can have the strange effect of making everyone look like a criminal.\n\nAbove all, I decided, let him be kind. From hundreds of donors, I whittled it down to two: the mechanical engineering student whose profile was somewhat restrained, but about whom the staff appraisal spoke glowingly; and a Danish musician with wavy hair who talked about his love of nature and art. \u201cHe sounds like the kind of man I would date,\u201d I told my friends. This was not necessarily a good thing, they pointed out. That night I lay in bed and imagined their profiles being read in the voices of my very worst boyfriends. I chose the engineer.\n\n***\n\nFriday morning, the day of my egg retrieval, and the donor sperm has not arrived. The courier office can tell me only that it has left Athens. I take the coast road to the clinic, walk slowly through the uncertain morning, and try not to think about the catastrophe before me. The air is sweet and soft, the sea a searing blue. I am watching the light play on the waves when, just beyond the port, I see the daily cargo boat approaching the shore, bringing supplies from the mainland: food and medicine and a nitrogen tank of donor sperm.\n\nIn the days that follow, I like to think of my eggs in the laboratory, cells dividing, happily gathering into blastocysts. It makes me feel less alone. I await news from the embryologist, sleeping, eating, taking long walks. One morning, I wake to a ruffling sound beyond my bedroom curtains. It is a bird, I think, that has flown into my courtyard. But when I look I find it is rain: heavy, plump drops on the corrugated iron roof and the broad leaves of the potted plants. That day the embryologist calls: transfer will be in two days\u2019 time.\n\nI sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant. There was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room\n\nAnother flight is cancelled. Getting home will now take some 42 hours, several changes of plane, and hundreds of pounds. \u201cDo I need to come and rescue you?\u201d an ex-boyfriend emails. I tell him he should know by now that I am not someone who takes well to rescuing. Perhaps if I did, I would not be here doing IVF alone in a foreign country in the first place.\n\nI am worried about the pigeons. The square outside the cathedral, in normal times surrounded by busy restaurants, lies quiet; deprived of their usual scraps, the birds seem bewildered. They flock near the cathedral steps, as if hoping for mercy. I take to feeding them: crusts of bread and old kalitsounia that brings them flocking around my ankles, burbling and fluttering as they eat. I feed the cats, too, their thin little bodies winding against my calves.\n\nI am the only patient at the clinic on the morning of my embryo transfer. The number of treatments is dwindling as no one can travel and there is too much uncertainty. My consultant, the junior nurse, the embryologist and I gather in the operating theatre. The embryologist plays Mozart through her phone to drown out the whirr of the generator. It is a simple procedure \u2013 the embryo being transferred to the womb via a catheter. \u201cThere!\u201d the consultant says. On the screen I watch a small dot make its way across the darkness and then settle.\n\nFor the next two weeks it will become the pale white dot upon which I live. I think about my tiny speck of hope as I follow the growing bleakness of the world: nurses in London wearing bin bags and scuba masks, the want of ventilators in New York City, the death toll in Italy that rises and rises. I try not to think about how I will get home, about the potential dangers of travelling across a continent, newly pregnant, in a pandemic.\n\nIn my isolation chamber I feel like a Russian doll, inside me another smaller me, confined in her own small isolation. I have been pregnant enough times that this state feels familiar: all-engulfing, electric. And yet I have miscarried enough to know that nothing is certain. I have often thought that the two-week wait between conception and pregnancy test is like being alone in a strange house: every sound, every shadow, can convince you that someone is there.\n\nFor a week I feel truly pregnant. And then suddenly I do not. One day I wake to feel a tangible distance between the synthetic hormones and my own body. I do not tell anyone. Instead I walk down to the water, stay out far beyond the mandated hour. I marvel at the flicker of tiny fish moving between the boats in the harbour. I look at the bright yellow tangle of fishing nets, the deep pink of wooden shutters, the distant mountains, snow-peaked against the bluest sky.\n\nI walk on beside the sea, past young couples, hands entwined, and think of how clinical and lustless the IVF process is. Of how a week ago I sat in a room that smelled of disinfectant, wearing a thin blue gown and a surgical mask. How there was no one\u2019s hand to hold, no love in the room. In the streets outside, spring had begun. There was the smell of orange blossom, and violet carpenter bees danced between branches. I stared up at the voluminous petals of bright red flowers, at stamen and pollen and anther and stalk, and thought that this was how reproduction ought to be: stickiness and scent, warmth and desire, all the senses colliding at once.\n\nOn the day I get a negative pregnancy test, 717 people die of coronavirus in the UK. For a long while, I sit on the edge of my bed and try to balance rationality and sorrow. I look at pictures from Italian hospitals, follow the upward curves of the latest graphs. Friends have lost loved ones, I tell myself; I have lost someone who barely ever existed. And yet I walk out into the cool sun of my courtyard and cry.\n\n\u2018She said she\u2019d be babysitting our embryo\u2019: what\u2019s it like to carry a child for a friend? Read more\n\nSome years ago, the writer India Knight published a self-help book, In Your Prime, in which she discussed the way that in adulthood our lives diverge into two camps: the have-children and the have-nots. For those caught up in the business of parenthood, she wrote, \u201cthere is no especial pleasure to be had in a single and/or childless person banging on about the minutiae of their small, unpeopled little life\u201d.\n\nThe phrase has stuck with me. As my friends have paired off and become parents, I have seen them less, travelled more, grown quieter. I cannot hope to understand the dramatic shifts and expansions in their lives, just as they are unlikely to understand the reduction of my own.\n\nAnd as the weeks of lockdown rolled on, that phrase has returned to me anew; I came to think how all our lives have grown small and unpeopled. How we have come to find pleasure in the minutiae: the slow drift of days, the unfurling of blossom, a street filled with clapping on a warm spring evening.

The family struggled with poverty during her childhood in Barbados; her home life was marred by violent arguments and her father\u2019s crippling drug and alcohol addictions. At school though, her teachers recorded that she was sure of herself, intelligent and \u201cvery observant of her environment\u201d. By the time she was 10, Rihanna had become a carer to her two younger brothers while her mother worked to support them. Her parents later divorced.\n\nIf humble, troubled beginnings go some way to explain the drive of the most successful stars, then Rihanna makes a bold claim to be among the biggest. At 32, she today enters the Sunday Times Rich list as the world\u2019s wealthiest female musician.\n\nBorn Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the pop megastar-turned-businesswoman has a fortune estimated at \u00a3468m. Eligible for inclusion in the newspaper\u2019s annual list since she moved to London over a year ago, Rihanna, who enters the musicians\u2019 category at No 3 after Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney, is now richer than Mick Jagger and Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Adele. And, to the consternation of her fans, she hasn\u2019t even released an album since 2016. She last did a concert tour the same year.\n\nHer rise to the top of Britain\u2019s elite list appears to have even shocked Robert Watts, who compiles it. \u201cShe somewhat caught us by surprise,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cVery few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer; now she\u2019s well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK.\u201d\n\nJay-Z and Rihanna, right, in New York in 2005, the year she signed her first record deal with him at Def Jam. Photograph: Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nRihanna was just 17 when her first single, Pon De Replay, became an unexpected global smash hit. (Her UK label was paying such little attention to its Caribbean signing at the time, it didn\u2019t even bother spelling her name right on their first ever run of \u201cRhianna\u201d CDs).\n\nAt 22, she became the only female artist in the history of the US Billboard chart to score four No 1 singles in a calendar year. By 24, she had won the record as the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, and at 31, Rihanna became the first black woman to run a luxury fashion house. Backed by luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), her fashion brand has been the key to building her staggering wealth.

Her Guyanese mother was an immigrant and her father came from mixed-race heritage, black and white. \u201cThe Guyanese are like the Mexicans of Barbados,\u201d she told British Vogue last month. \u201cThat\u2019s why I really relate and empathise with Latino people who are discriminated against in America.\u201d\n\nRihanna spent her early teenage years training as an army cadet. When she was 14, she formed the girl group Contrast with her friends. That summer, in 2003, the group auditioned for US music producer Evan Richards, who immediately dumped the other girls and set about making Rihanna a solo star. A meeting was arranged with Jay-Z at Def Jam records \u2013 he signed her on the spot.\n\nIn 2007, at 19 and with three albums already under her belt, Rihanna told the Observer: \u201cThey locked me into the office \u2013 til 3am. Then Jay-Z said: \u2018There\u2019s only two ways out: out the door after you sign this deal or through this window.\u2019\u201d Naively, perhaps, she was thrilled by the story. \u201cWe were on the 29th floor,\u201d she said. \u201c[It was] very flattering.\u201d Later, she said she felt stifled by the contract she signed so young, which saw her churn out seven hit albums in seven years.\n\nBut the release of 2007\u2019s Good Girl Gone Bad marked a creative turning point and saw Rihanna drop her label-mandated image which she deemed \u201cgirlie and boring\u201d to experiment with \u201cdifferent, unexpected and edgy\u201d looks. She moved on from reggae-flavoured dancehall and delivered Umbrella, a track that earned her the first of nine Grammys and spent 71 weeks in the UK charts, staying at No 1 for 10 of them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s now got enough incredible singles to fill five greatest hits albums, and it\u2019s amazing she\u2019s never released one,\u201d says Michael Cragg, music journalist and editor of BEAT magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s got one great album \u2013 Anti \u2013 but like Madonna, she\u2019s made so many good singles it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her ninth album is allegedly imminent, but then it has been for the last year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rihanna and her then boyfriend Chris Brown on stage in 2008, the year they made their relationship public. The following year Brown, 19, was charged with assaulting her. Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nWhile, professionally, Rihanna is at her peak, she has faced hardship in her private life. A year after going public about her relationship with RnB singer Chris Brown, photos of her battered face \u2013 swollen and bruised \u2013 were leaked to the press. Brown had beaten her after an argument in the car home from an awards ceremony. The couple broke up, but reconciled several times over the next four years.\n\nIn a 2009 US television interview with Diane Sawyer, Rihanna said that Brown was her \u201cfirst big love\u201d. She had been warned that her reconciliation with him would set a bad example for young girls. \u201cI realise that my selfish decision for love could result in some getting killed,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if Chris never hit me again, who\u2019s to say that [their abusers] won\u2019t kill these girls?\u201d In 2013, back again with Brown, she told Rolling Stone, she didn\u2019t care what people thought : \u201cI decided it was important for me to be happy \u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to let anyone\u2019s opinion get in the way of that.\u201d Months later they broke up again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rihanna in the audience at California\u2019s Coachella music festival in 2012. Photograph: Christopher Polk/Getty Images for Coachella\n\nWhile music has been the backbone to her creative success, her commercial skill goes far beyond singing songs. Designers including Tom Ford and Alexander Wang have been quick to heap praise on her, marking out her daring and constant reinvention. \u201cShe\u2019s an amplified version of what a lot of girls want to look like, but she\u2019s always one step ahead of the game,\u201d designer Peter Dundas told British Vogue.\n\nCritics largely agree it\u2019s a talent that applies to her songs, too. The New Yorker, noting that her limited vocal range has never been the draw, declared in 2016 that her \u201creal art\u201d was \u201cher accessible brand of casual, forward-thinking cool\u201d. Put plainly, Rihanna excels at producing influential pop anthems that reverberate from school discos to underground clubs.\n\nRihanna is notorious for playing against pop machine\u2019s rules and has cultivated a brand \u2013 the \u201cBad Gal Riri\u201d of her Instagram handle \u2013 that is unapologetically sexual. She has her critics: Annie Lennox accused her of peddling \u201cpornographic\u201d music videos, and Mail on Sunday columnist Liz Jones called her \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cpoisonous\u201d.\n\n\u201cHer fans lap it up,\u201d says Cragg. \u201cRihanna can be messy, get drunk, have spats on Twitter, sit on the shoulders of her bodyguard at Coachella rolling a blunt, and it\u2019s part of her charm.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still got a real edge and you can\u2019t market that or fabricate it in any way. She genuinely has to have really great taste to still be so relevant at this point in her career.\u201d\n\nBy all accounts, Rihanna is supremely slick at what she does \u2013 with little sign that she\u2019s letting up.\n\n\u201cI was always trying to figure out \u2018how can I change the world? What could I do?\u2019\u201d she told the Observer in 2007. \u201cI think the American way is a fantasy \u2026 Their priorities are fancy cars and bling.

But we\u2019ve had a crash course in an old-fashioned way of feeding a family\n\nBefore coronavirus I was eating out around 10 times a week. Sometimes more, if I felt like I was wasting away, or less, if my doctor sister had texted me about diabetes again. It wasn\u2019t just gluttony. I write about restaurants. And it wasn\u2019t always the grande bouffe. Sometimes just soup. Sounds defensive, doesn\u2019t it? It looks excessive from our new vantage point.\n\nThat lifestyle came shuddering to a halt at the start of March. Our daughter Lily was born on 11 March. Then the lockdown began. I haven\u2019t been to a restaurant for nearly two months. Other critics have written heartbroken paeans to their former sweethearts. Not me. In fact, the longer the lockdown goes on, the more I wonder whether I miss them at all. The past few weeks have been a crash course in an old-fashioned version of sustenance. We plan meals, shop for ingredients, cook them ourselves. I feed wife, wife feeds daughter, nobody starves, I get to feel useful.\n\nWe are working our way through recipes we\u2019ve been meaning to try.

It should probably be more fraught. But it is a peaceful life, where the choices are basically reduced to \u201cwhat would you like to eat today?\u201d, a vision of a quieter existence that will end soon. I know we are lucky.

Our West Highland terrier, Ziggy, who had travelled the world with us, was rapidly declining.\n\nShe\u2019d beaten the odds three times following the discovery of a mass on her bladder which was finally confirmed as cancer. But in the space of a few months she\u2019d gone from accompanying us on 10km runs to struggling to walk, unable to pee and poo easily, her quality of life rapidly declining.\n\nWe\u2019d decided we wanted to be with her when she was euthanised \u2013 the kindest thing to do, our vet told us \u2013 but by that time in March that service was in short supply.\n\nThe best option we could find was for the procedure to be performed in a quiet part of a vet\u2019s car park in Epping Forest. It felt grim to contemplate. But in the end it was painfully moving, her last moments spent curled up between us as we sat on the ground, her chin resting in my lap.\n\nIt is perhaps why, last week, the television gardener Monty Don\u2019s response to the loss of his own dog Nigel triggered a jolt of recognition. \u201cWhat he had,\u201d said Don, \u201cwas this absolute sense of purity. He exuded an unsullied innocence. We all love our dogs but I\u2019ve had lots of dogs and he was special; it\u2019s very hard to put your finger on it.\u201d\n\nAmid the sadness, these days there is also a feeling of guilt. A sense somehow that \u2013 real as it is \u2013 it is wrong to be feeling grief for a dog at a time when so many others are losing friends and family.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Monty Don with his dogs Nigel and Nell. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nThe dog thing came late for me. I just about remember our childhood English bull terrier, Fanny, a stage dog my father adopted while he was working in the theatre after she was fired for biting members of the cast of Oliver!\n\nZiggy, though, arrived in my late 40s, and became a firm fixture in our lives, accompanying us everywhere, including on a four-year stint as the Guardian and Observer\u2019s correspondent in Jerusalem.\n\nNow, he was gone. And suddenly we were without a dog.\n\nScientists and psychologists are still edging towards understanding the strange and millennia-old relationship between dogs and humans. On the animals\u2019 side of things, the picture is reasonably clear: the grey wolf, from which all breeds of domesticated dogs descended, already had a highly evolved, sophisticated and social brain. And, as dogs became domesticated, that brain appears to have acquired a sensitivity towards the human gaze and body language that allowed for training.\n\nBut, beyond the developing utilitarian function of dogs, the human draw to make canines their pets has prompted competing explanations.\n\nAs Marta Borgi and Francesca Cirulli of the department of behavioural neuroscience at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 in Rome suggested in a paper in Frontiers in Psychology: \u201cWhy animals constitute such an attractive stimulus for humans has not been completely clarified.\n\n\u201cLiving beings engage the attention of people more than objects do, and it has been hypothesised that the evolutionary reason behind this response is that paying attention to other living beings is significant for individual fitness.\u201d\n\nOther theories have been posited. One suggests that we feel a greater attraction to species that are closer to us on the genetic family tree or that are similar in behavioural or cognitive ways.\n\nThen there is the long-established notion of Kindchenschema or \u201cbaby schema\u201d, which suggests humans are attracted specifically to animals that display \u201ccute\u201d or infantile features with a large head and obvious eyes, although recent MRI studies of brain activation patterns in women viewing facial images of their own child and own dog suggested different responses.\n\nAnd while many of those specialising in the field have sought to avoid the use of the word \u201cfriendship\u201d in response to animal-human relationships, Borgi and Cirulli embrace it.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion \u2018friendship\u2019 appears to be the most suitable word to describe close human-pet relationships, which imply the formation of a social bond that serves analogous emotional and adaptive functions as human-human friendships,\u201d they write.\n\n'Friendship\u2019 appears to be the most suitable word to describe close human-pet relationships Marta Borgi and Francesca Cirulli\n\n\u201cMost of the properties that a relationship should have in order to be characterised as friendship are traceable in the human-pet association: intimacy, companionship, trust, loyalty, commitment, affection, acceptance, sympathy, concern for the other\u2019s welfare, as well as time spent together and maintenance of the pair bond after long separations.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, as the Pulitzer-winning poet Mary Oliver wrote in Dog Talk, the end piece essay for the collection Dog Songs, some of the attachment relates to the way in which canines occupy a middle space between the wild and the tame worlds, interpreting that other place for us.\n\n\u201cSome things are unchangeably wild, others stolidly tame \u2026 There are wild things that have been altered, but only into a semblance of tameness, it is no real change. But the dog lives in both worlds.\u201d\n\nBut it is Don\u2019s comment about \u201cunsullied innocence\u201d that resonates the most with me. After Ziggy\u2019s death a friend suggested that what we see in our dogs are \u201chairy little saints\u201d. And in a time of such uncertainty, our social bonds disrupted, it is perhaps this that people are seeking.\n\nLast week a new dog arrived in our lives. Mindful of the \u201chairy saint\u201d description we\u2019ve called him Bodhi, meaning \u201cawakened,\u201d although into what dog world we\u2019ll never know. It is always an emotional contract, entered into, as Oliver puts it, in the knowledge of our dogs\u2019 brief time on earth.\n\n\u201cIt is exceedingly short, his galloping life.

Photograph: Martin Meissner/Pool via Getty Images\n\nFar quicker to find their step after the unfamiliarity and tentativeness of the opening 10 minutes or so, Dortmund eventually dominated their opponents despite a list of absentees that included club captain Marco Reus, Axel Witzel and Emre Can. Having passed his 20th birthday during the lockdown, and set to be the subject of speculation whenever the transfer window opens, Jadon Sancho did not make an appearance for Dortmund until coming off the bench in the 79th minute.\n\nThat opened up a first ever starting place for Giovanni Reyna, son of Claudio Reyna, the former USA captain, only for the 17-year-old to suffer an injury in the warm-up. Instead, Hazard stepped into a Dortmund attacking trident that caused huge problems to a static Schalke.\n\nUntil Sancho\u2019s arrival, it was left to Schalke\u2019s Jonjoe Kenny, loaned from Everton, to represent England in European football\u2019s return to action beyond the borders of Belarus; Welshman Rabbi Matondo also came on for Schalke at the start of the second half.

Haaland was far braver than Salif San\u00e9 in the tackle after a Schalke move broke down, and the ball came to Brandt, who set up Hazard to score past Schubert three minutes after half time.\n\nGuerreiro was again sent clear to score Dortmund\u2019s 63rd-minute fourth, with Haaland supplying the final pass beyond a malfunctioning Schalke offside trap.

If not, some form of legalised ball-tampering may be required.\n\nQuick guide The key principles of England's plan Show Hide Zones\n\nThe cricket grounds used this summer \u2013 expected to be the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford because of their on-site hotels \u2013 will be divided up into areas and movement between them strictly limited. A one-way system of paths will be set up around the ground. Functional areas This is a group of staff \u2013 for example players or broadcasters \u2013 who are clearly defined and must operate solely within their designated zones. Some zones may be required to have more than one functional area working in it at the same time, such as players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match, but they cannot interact. Contact clusters\n\n\n\nIndividuals within a functional area can form their own exclusive social pod that, provided everyone involved commits to remaining socially distant from outsiders, allows them to relax in each other\u2019s company. All three concepts are designed to minimise the number of interactions an individual makes and reduces the risk of transmission in the event of an outbreak.\n\nDrafted by the ECB\u2019s science and medicine team, an introductory outline circulated to the counties explains the process of a return for professional cricket that, from Wednesday, will see the first of 30 England players report back for individual training under phase one. But it also lays out the principles of how a bio-secure venue may operate on match day.\n\nAfter phase two, where training is permitted to take place in small groups, players and support staff from both sides would enter an \u201cisland site\u201d \u2013 a cricket ground with a hotel \u2013 for phase three and, following initial testing for coronavirus, they will then live and train on site but only within strictly designated zones.\n\n\n\nAshley Giles, England\u2019s cricket director, has confirmed they are looking at ways England\u2019s players can leave and re-enter the so-called \u201cbubble\u201d given a block of nine weeks away from friends and family that covers preparation time, practice games and the six proposed Tests, starting at Hampshire\u2019s Ageas Bowl on 8 July.\n\nHowever when the squad is together in the ground and part of a regular testing and screening programme it forms what is called a \u201cfunctional area\u201d, one of a number of separate personnel groups that also include venue staff, the ECB events team, groundstaff, broadcasters/media and match officials within an overall headcount of around 300.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The hotel at the Ageas Bowl is set to form part of the\n\nbio-secure environment that players will enter.

Perhaps the most intriguing element of the plan is the concept of \u201ccontact clusters\u201d, where individuals within an FA group can create their own exclusive sub-group.\n\nThe principle here is that individuals within a \u201ccontact cluster\u201d avoid anything but essential contact with those outside of it and so can relax within what is called \u201ca circle of trust\u201d.

Vialli is at his home in Chelsea, where he is in lockdown with his wife and two teenage daughters. His elderly parents live in Cremona, the town in northern Italy which has been hit so hard by the coronavirus. He cannot talk as he remembers why he did not tell them when he was first diagnosed with pancreatic cancer in 2017.\n\nI break the silence because it\u2019s understandable he would not wish his parents to suffer. \u201cYes,\u201d the 55-year-old agrees as he composes himself. \u201cThere is also all this shame. I\u2019ve always been perceived as a tough guy. A strong guy with a lot of determination. To not be in that position made me uneasy. I didn\u2019t want to be looked at as a poor guy with a disease. That\u2019s why I didn\u2019t share it widely for 12 months.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s also a burden. People will call to show they\u2019re thinking about you. I thought that, instead of spending time on the phone, I needed time for myself. That\u2019s why I wore a jumper under the shirt \u2013 to hide that I\u2019d lost so much weight. These feelings are natural and stay with you a while. And then, at least in my case, they go away. The day you start looking at things differently, your life changes. Now I show my scars with pride. They are a sign of what I\u2019ve been through.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluca Vialli poses for a photo as a young boy. Photograph: Popperfoto\n\nVialli played 59 matches for Italy. He helped Sampdoria win the Cup Winners\u2019 Cup in 1990 and their first Serie A title a year later. He lifted another Scudetto and the Champions League with Juventus. That 1996 final was his last game before he became a Chelsea player and then their manager during his four years at Stamford Bridge.\n\nThe forgotten story of \u2026 Sampdoria's only scudetto | Rob Smyth Read more\n\nHe has always been amiable and intelligent but, over the course of a 70-minute conversation, Vialli emerges as an even more impressive man. \u201cI know now that you need to let out the pain,\u201d he says. \u201cI wasn\u2019t particularly good at showing my emotions and I kept things inside. It\u2019s not good. Now I realise that whenever I want to cry, I cry. There\u2019s no shame. And if you want to laugh, you laugh. I try not to cry in front of people that might get very emotional. I try to cry by myself. When I\u2019m in a comfortable place, I don\u2019t hold anything inside. I just let it out, and I feel better afterwards.\u201d\n\nVialli is remarkably comfortable in this interview, even when reflecting on the closeness of death and revealing that he now faces tests every three months to check whether he is still clear of the disease. He nods in acknowledgement when I ask if his past as a footballer prevented him from expressing his emotions before cancer turned his life inside out. \u201cYes. We portrayed ourselves as tough guys that could deal with anything without showing any weakness. But I now realise the power of vulnerability and that, actually, it can be a powerful tool to get inside people\u2019s hearts. It creates empathy \u2013 and empathy is everything. I\u2019m not ashamed of saying we all cry \u2013 sometimes because we are scared. In my case I was crying because I was scared of the unknown. I did not know whether I was going to be fine or not. It\u2019s different than if you cry because you\u2019ve lost a match.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Gianluca Vialli celebrates as Chelsea player-manager after victory in the 1998 Cup Winners\u2019 Cup final against Stuttgart in Stockholm. Photograph: Ullstein bild via Getty Images\n\nHe laughs wryly at the fleeting pain of football. Vialli\u2019s outlook on life has clearly changed over the past three years \u2013 while he has endured two separate nine-month spells of chemotherapy, which eventually led to his being declared cancer-free last December.\n\n\u201cThis is my personal view,\u201d Vialli says. \u201cBut my friends, people who eventually knew about my condition, said: \u2018Come on, you\u2019re going to win this fight. You can beat cancer.\u2019 I always felt I didn\u2019t want to fight cancer, because it would be too big and powerful an enemy. I felt this is a journey. It\u2019s about the right therapies and the right doctors. It\u2019s about travelling with an unwanted travel companion until hopefully it gets bored and dies before me.\u201d\n\nRichie Sadlier: 'I thought I'd better find out where my abuser was' Read more\n\nVialli is in a philosophical mood as we discuss his new book, Goals, which features 90 stories about inspirational sportsmen and women who overcame adversity. They range from Jackie Robinson and Jesse Owens to Billie Jean King and Natalie du Toit, Alex Zanardi and Emil Zatopek to LeBron James and Ronda Rousey. They read even more powerfully at a time of great crisis for the world, as each story is preceded by a mantra of hope.\n\nBefore we read about Zanardi, the Italian motor racing driver who lost both his legs after a terrible crash in 2001, the quote attached to his story reads: \u201cLife is 10% what happens to you and 90% how you react it.\u201d Once he had got used to his prosthetic legs Zanardi returned to Formula One as a test driver and won races in the European Touring Car series. As a Paralympic hand cyclist, Zanardi then won two gold medals at London 2012 before matching the feat four years later in Rio.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the key mantra,\u201d Vialli says. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the way we deal with situations. Alex could\u2019ve gone into a depression, but why focus on the negative? In my situation, I was shocked when I heard I had cancer. But then I thought: \u2018I\u2019ve got to make this a journey that helps me grow. I don\u2019t always see it that way, but that\u2019s my aim.\u201d\n\nThe book ends with the most compelling story \u2013 as Vialli details how two bouts of cancer and chemotherapy affected him. \u201cI found out that pancreatic cancer is one of the worst cancers,\u201d he recalls. \u201cSo I was shocked, confused, helpless, hopeless. But it helped that I\u2019d been an athlete. I was used to getting injured and so with cancer I could say: \u2018Operation? When? You\u2019re discharging me? When? Then I\u2019m starting chemo? For how long?\u2019 For me it was about setting goals. I also know that nothing is permanent and it will all pass.\u201d\n\nVialli would learn another brutal truth. Remission can be temporary. His cancer came back in March 2019. \u201cWe thought everything was going OK. And then, all of a sudden, you get a temperature. You go for a blood test and they say: \u2018Let\u2019s make sure there\u2019s nothing sinister.\u2019 I found out then. It was back.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Sampdoria fans with a banner in tribute to Vialli at their game against Bologna in December 2018. Photograph: Paolo Rattini/Getty Images\n\nVialli leans closer to the screen. \u201cTo be honest,\u201d he says, \u201cI asked myself: \u2018Did you really think you were going to get away with cancer that easily?\u2019 The second time was definitely tougher because it\u2019s the cumulative effect. I wasn\u2019t so strong and there was some despair. You\u2019re thinking: \u2018Oh my God, this guy is back.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnother nine blurring months of chemotherapy passed and, in December 2019, Vialli was given fresh hope. \u201cThey call it NED,\u201d he explains. \u201cNo evidence of disease. I\u2019m perfectly aware it will take a while before I\u2019m given the all clear. Unfortunately, these things have a tendency to come back. But at the moment I am in a good place. I hope to stay in a good place until I die of old age.\u201d\n\nForgotten Stories of Football Football, farce and fascism at the 1936 Olympics Sorry your browser does not support audio - but you can download here and listen https://audio.guim.co.uk/2020/05/12-56802-gnl.fsof.200513.jf.Fascism.mp3 00:00:00 00:13:14\n\nVialli has anxious days when he worries if the cancer will return. But he spends more time talking about gratitude. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that gratitude is a very powerful emotion. And I\u2019m very grateful to many wonderful people \u2013 my wife and family and all the people who have looked after me. They\u2019re not just competent and knowledgeable. They really feel what you\u2019re going through and there\u2019s a great deal of empathy. I\u2019m looked after at the Royal Marsden in Chelsea. It\u2019s an amazing hospital.\u201d\n\nHas it been difficult to maintain such positivity amid Covid-19? \u201cFor me it has been hard because I come from Cremona. It probably has the highest death rate in the region. In a way I feel I should be there with my people. I felt so bad reading that people were dying in hospital without their loved ones. It\u2019s a tragedy.\n\n\u201cStaying at home in Chelsea is not a problem. I can work remotely. I can walk to the park. My wife and daughters are here and it\u2019s great to be with them 24/7. In London I only know two people that tested positive. Thank God I have not lost anyone I know in this country. But it\u2019s different in Cremona where there are only 80,000 people. London has six million people. You feel it more in a smaller place.\u201d\n\nWhat does Vialli think of the Premier League trying to resume next month? \u201cIn times of grief, and when you\u2019re going through a difficult situation like this, some psychologists say we should try to do things that give us pleasure without feeling guilty about it. So if football could be a tool to give people some relief then I look forward to its return.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\n\u201cThat said, I can only imagine what the players are feeling. I could advise them about injury or when they fall out with the manager. I can share my experiences with them. But in this situation I wouldn\u2019t know what to tell them. This is unprecedented. If I was still a player, I would probably find it difficult to focus on football because people are still dying.\u201d\n\nSince last October he has worked alongside Roberto Mancini, his former Sampdoria teammate, who now manages Italy. \u201cI have started this new chapter as the head of the Italian national team football delegation. I am so happy I\u2019ve ended up working with my best friend. It feels great to be able to help Roberto and I love trying to inspire the players. My contract runs to the end of the World Cup in Qatar in December 2022. We are carrying on and trying to do as much as possible.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Goals, Gianluca Vialli\u2019s new book. Photograph: Courtesy of Gianluca Vialli\n\nIt seems fitting that Vialli should express his optimism before we say goodbye. \u201cI must think positively,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019ve also got to acknowledge when I have some negative thoughts. Acknowledge, separate and challenge them. Yes, I am positive personally. I am also positive about the world. The crisis will pass. What I\u2019d like to see next is that we do not forget these lessons.\n\n\u201cIf you look at climate change we have a chance to do something about it. We are now saying health is the most important thing. Great. Why, once the virus is gone, would we go back to living in a place where the air is so polluted? Why don\u2019t we prevent people getting sick and dying from pollution? Surely we should be prepared to give up a little bit of our wealth, our so-called quality of life, for a safer and healthier planet? I feel very strongly about this kind of future.\u201d\n\nGoals: Inspirational Stories to Help Tackle Life\u2019s Challenges by Gianluca Vialli is published by Headline", "author": ["Donald Mcrae"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/2020/may/16/is-it-royal-ascot-without-us-irish-concern-over-racings-restarts", "published": "2020-05-16T17:13:06", "title": "'Is it Royal Ascot without us?' Irish concern over racing's restart", "text": "\u201cPostpone Royal Ascot for at least a week\u201d was the plea from a leading Irish trainer on Saturday, following the news that the sport in Ireland will resume on 8 June. British officials have insisted on leaving the meeting in its long-established slot, beginning on 16 June, which may mean very few or perhaps even no Irish runners in prestigious two-year-old races such as the Coventry Stakes.\n\n\u201cIf you put the pressure on us by keeping Ascot on 16 June, you\u2019re basically ruling us out,\u201d Ger Lyons said in reference to the juvenile races. \u201cIf you want proper Ascot ... you\u2019ll have to tell me, is Ascot really Ascot without the internationals?\n\nRoyal Ascot set for go-ahead behind closed doors in traditional June slot Read more\n\n\u201cBy us jumping off on the 8th, we\u2019re not going to get enough horses qualified for your two-year-old races. To be fair to everybody, Ascot have to seriously consider moving everything back a week, just to give everybody a chance to catch up. Once you\u2019re through the first three or four weeks, we\u2019ll all find our legs.\u201d\n\nBritish racing hopes to resume a week earlier than Ireland, on 1 June, and there will be 28 races for two-year-olds in the first eight days, specifically so that trainers can get a run into horses being aimed at Royal Ascot. Ascot\u2019s juvenile races are sure to be over-subscribed and priority will be given to any horse that has finished in the first four of a race, meaning that unraced horses, from Ireland or elsewhere, will need luck to get into the lineup.\n\nThat will be preying on the mind of Aidan O\u2019Brien, whose nine wins in the Coventry is a trainers\u2019 record. If he is to follow up last year\u2019s success with Arizona, he may need to find a two-year-old who can run to a high standard in consecutive weeks.\n\nLyons pointed to another obstacle facing Irish trainers who want to race in Britain, that any jockeys or staff they send over will have to self-isolate for a fortnight on returning to Ireland. For that reason, Lyons may skip the 2,000 Guineas with his classy Siskin and run instead in the Irish equivalent, which he hopes will be on 8 June or soon after.\n\nJudging by Lyons\u2019 enthusiasm, Siskin could take high rank among three-year-old milers this summer. \u201cI couldn\u2019t be happier with him,\u201d the trainer said. \u201cI was worried about him staying a mile in the middle of spring but he\u2019s turned a corner and I\u2019m not worried now. I wish the Guineas was tomorrow.\u201d\n\nTalking Horses: Irish racing gets early return, plus Hong Kong tips Read more\n\nIf Siskin runs in the Irish Guineas while O\u2019Brien\u2019s Arizona comes to Newmarket, that will suit Lyons perfectly in view of a rumour about how well that rival is working at Ballydoyle. \u201cI heard they sent up a drone to film him going up the gallops, and the drone couldn\u2019t keep up. My feeling is, they should sack the drone operator ...\u201d\n\nAscot\u2019s Nick Smith said the Royal meeting would stay in its established slot, to avoid conflicting with race meetings scheduled for other tracks later in the summer. \u201cThe problem with [a delay] is you really start to clog up the Pattern schedule,\u201d he told Sky Sports Racing. \u201cYou\u2019d basically be asking Newmarket to cancel the July meeting. And who knows how far it would have to go back? Then you start to put Glorious Goodwood at risk. It\u2019s just not the way the Pattern operates.\n\n\u201cThis is not going to be an ideal scenario. I\u2019m not going to say that anybody\u2019s going to have the ideal preparation. But we all feel that we have a duty to get this show on the road and get it done. We could get broadly back to a regular Pattern within five or six weeks and if we were able to do that ...

In addition, according to Murdock, those patients were not required to be tested following their release.\n\n\"As a result, a lot of these folks went back to nursing homes people got sick -- nursing homes which had not been touched by COVID-19 suddenly became hotbeds of COVID-19 -- and unfortunately a lot of seniors in nursing homes started dying in huge numbers,\" Murdock remarked. \"The death toll right now is about 5,300 [or] something like that.\"\n\nAdditionally, nursing home directors have reported they've begged the state for more protective equipment and tests as well as help in relocating positive patients, but pleas have gone unanswered. All of this comes as the number of workers who called out sick steadily rose.\n\nCuomo has since amended his policy, adding a directive telling hospitals that they must test patients and patients must be negative before being returned to nursing homes. He is also now requiring nursing homes to test staff twice weekly.\n\nWhile more than 5,000 seniors have passed away at nursing homes across the Empire State, the virus has made its way into 7,500 long-term care facilities nationwide. All over the country, more than 143,000 of their residents and workers have contracted the illness and more than 25,600 have died, according to a New York Times analysis. That number accounts for more than a third of the deaths from the pandemic which is now at a total of almost 86,000 people.\n\nAccording to Murdock, Florida approached the nursing home crisis in the right way.\n\n\"They sent people to make sure the nursing homes had all of the equipment they needed. They gave them additional training on how to avoid infections, And, the result so far has been about 665 folks, seniors dead in nursing homes in Florida,\" he remarked.\n\n\"The death rate in Florida is about three per 100,000. In New York state it's 27.5 per 100,000. So, [that\u2019s] nine times worse,\" he added. \"Absolutely tragic [and] totally, totally unnecessary!\"\n\nAs New York Republicans call for an inquiry into Cuomo's handling of the situation, Murdock told Hegseth that the media needs to do more to hold Cuomo to account for those lost in the shuffle.\n\nCLICK HERE FOR THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"And, it would be one thing if all of the other hospitals were full. But, we have the Javits Center about one-third empty. We had the USNS Comfort -- the hospital ship that President Trump set up here \u2013 that had 182 beds filled out of a thousand,\" he continued. \"So, it\u2019s not like there weren\u2019t alternatives to send people where they could go and be isolated and not get healthy seniors infected and ultimately killed.\n\n\"Andrew Cuomo really needs to be held to account on this and I wish the media would do it.\n\n\"I'm hearing a little bit of criticism here in New York, but I don\u2019t hear much nationwide.\"", "author": ["Julia Musto", "Julia Musto Is A Reporter For Fox News Digital.

This was in response to a March 16 public health order seeking to free up as many hospital beds as possible to handle the expected high volume of COVID patients.\n\nIn addition to governors and hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. surgeon general and many medical organizations such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommended interim cancellation of elective surgical procedures. Physicians and health care organizations across the country responded appropriately and canceled nonessential cases.\n\nAs most of you know, I am married to an orthopedic surgeon and approximately 90 percent of his surgical cases are elective.

Although the patients fully understood, that didn\u2019t take away their pain or their worry.\n\nMany states are starting to reopen nonessential businesses, a sign that restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are slowly easing. In California, where I live, we are now allowed to return to the beaches (with some restrictions) and pick up merchandise bought online from some retailers curbside.\n\nIn many other states, hospitals are making plans again to allow elective surgeries to be performed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom cleared the way this week for hospitals throughout the state to resume some discretionary surgeries. He urged providers to work together to ensure that resuming non-urgent services \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect their abilities to respond to any surges of COVID patients.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI agree with the governor and with those doctors and hospitals who feel it\u2019s time to move forward with elective procedures. And I say this for a few reasons:\n\nThis public health order was put in place so personal protective equipment would not be taken from those treating COVID-19 patients and hospital beds wouldn\u2019t be limited. As the first wave of this pandemic is hopefully going to be behind us soon (depending on where you live), the pent-up patient demand for surgical and procedural case is going to be immense. And the medical community can show that it is prepared to meet this demand.\n\nPatients are in pain and if they are not operated on within a certain time frame, their conditions are likely to worsen. Doctors have taken an oath to do no harm and these procedures simply cannot be delayed indefinitely.\n\nElective surgeries make up a substantial portion of hospital revenue and, as a result of COVID-19 and not scheduling these elective cases, hospital revenues have flatlined.\n\nHealth care represents approximately 18 percent of the GDP, so any financial improvements in the health sector can quickly help to stabilize state and national economies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bottom line is many hospitals have the beds and supplies to accommodate both the patients and the staff. Conversations with hospital operators throughout the nation convened earlier this week show many are ready to move forward. The doctors are ready and patients want their pain or their situation to be changed or improved.\n\nIf we are concerned about our nation\u2019s health both physically and financially, and if all conditions are met by hospitals and the health care providers, it is time to take a step forward and allow our nation\u2019s physicians to do what they were trained to do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "author": ["Leslie Marshall", "Leslie Marshall Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In", "Providing Analysis On Both Political", "Social Issues A Liberal Point Of View.

BUT THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT POWER\n\nPresident Trump's critics imply that the draft guidelines were too rigorous and the president is making safety a low priority.\n\nNonsense.\n\nThe real problems with the draft guidelines were that they took a one-size-fits-all approach despite the huge differences between rural counties and dense cities like New York and that they were outdated.\n\nThey could have been written 50 years ago, ignoring technologies available now that can control the spread of disease and make returning to work or school safer. The final guidelines are shorter, but still a half-century behind the times.\n\nAgency guidelines for schools and offices, for example, recommend placing desks six feet apart and encouraging frequent hand hygiene.\n\nFine, but the agency should also be informing employers and school administrators of the many other tools available. They could upgrade to antimicrobial surfaces, including doorknobs, computer keyboards, handrails and other frequently touched surfaces.\n\nNumerous studies show how viral traces deposited on a doorknob can be spread by touch, infecting many people in just a few hours.\n\nCopper naturally destroys viruses and bacteria. Several manufacturers produce molded polymer products embedded with copper, including desktops, keyboards and chair arms.\n\nAntimicrobial coatings can also be painted on existing floors, furniture and equipment. All of these high-tech approaches are already used in hospitals. Now is the time to inform the public about their usefulness in combatting the coronavirus.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe CDC also recommends that schools, offices and other venues open windows and doors to increase air circulation.\n\nResearch finds that air conditioning can spread viral droplets from an infected person to other people across the room, depending on the direction of the airflow. Bringing in fresh air is better.\n\nMakes sense, but opening the windows is not always an option. The agency should at least mention that there are more effective options available, including continuous, nontoxic disinfection devices that can be installed in the HVAC system.\n\nThese technologies are already used by professional sports teams in their locker rooms, and by manufacturers and hospitals. They deactivate viruses in the air and reduce traces of virus or bacteria on surfaces.\n\nThe side benefit is a healthier workforce and lower absenteeism even if the coronavirus fades soon.\n\nThe CDC guidelines never once mention public restrooms. But reducing the risk of viral spread when toilets are flushed is important. The key is to be sure all toilets have lids.\n\nResearch indicates that coronavirus is carried in feces. When a toilet is flushed, the virus can become aerosolized. New findings in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases suggest the virus is found in heavy concentrations in restrooms.\n\nPresident Trump has built a huge force of private sector companies to help with ventilators, masks, therapeutics and hopefully vaccines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt his press conferences, he stresses the importance of private sector innovation and capacity to beat the coronavirus.

It is administered by Israel, and contains several clearly defined Israeli population centers, most of which are contiguous to Israel.\n\nBut while European nations are quick to criticize Israel, they are passive about the real threats to stability in the region.\n\nJust last week, Mohsen Rezaei of Iran\u2019s Expediency Council threatened to \u201craze Israeli cities to the ground\u201d even in the event there is a U.S. response to Iranian attacks against American forces in Iraq.\n\nThese threats \u2013 to destroy Israeli cities filled with civilians and wipe out \u201cthe Zionist entity\u201d and the \u201cZionist cancer\u201d \u2013 are made on a regular basis by leading Iranian officials like Rezaei. The response in Europe to such genocidal rhetoric is essentially a collective yawn.\n\nIt reminds one of similar language used by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the years when it was hijacking airliners, attacking synagogues in Rome and Antwerp, planting bombs in buses in Israeli cities, and calling for Israel\u2019s destruction. At the time, much of this was dismissed by European governments as \u201cIsrael\u2019s problem,\u201d or minimized as just being for \u201chome (Palestinian) consumption.\u201d\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t take it seriously. That, while Iran continues its malign presence in Syria, attacks American bases in Iraq, re-stocks the arms depots of the terrorist group Hezbollah, counts the terrorist group Hamas as a willing ally, sends a military satellite into space, and marches on in its ultimate goal of developing nuclear weapons.\n\nIndeed, most European states are still not sure whether or not to call the nuclear deal with Iran \u2013 the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) \u2013 a failed enterprise, even while Iranian efforts to dominate the Middle East proceed apace.\n\nAnd yet, Europe always has time to express bias against Israel.\n\nPronouncements out of Brussels from the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, called annexation by Israel \u201ca serious violation of international law\u201d and said the EU \u201cwill act accordingly.\u201d\n\nSimilar warnings have come from Paris, Berlin and other capitals. Threats of imposing sanctions on Israel and the recall of ambassadors are being made, all in the name of protecting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nEurope\u2019s admonitions against Israel ring hollow.\n\nSince the-then European Economic Community (the forerunner of the EU) 1980 Venice Declaration that endorsed Palestinian self-government, Europe has been largely supportive of the Palestinian narrative to the conflict.\n\nWhen the EU has imposed discipline of voting at the United Nations, member states often abstain on Israeli-Palestinian issues, which to the Palestinian camp is seen as wavering support in Europe for Israel.\n\nEurope\u2019s admonitions against Israel ring hollow.\n\nWhen left to vote on their own, some European countries have voted with the Palestinian side on issues concerning Jerusalem, for example, at UNESCO or even at the World Health Organization.\n\nThere is also an interesting breakdown when no EU bloc voting is imposed at the U.N. Most countries in Central and Eastern Europe are more inclined to be supportive of Israel. But instances of such \u201copen voting\u201d are few and far between.\n\nIf Europe wanted to be helpful it would have been pushing the Palestinians from the time of the 1993 Oslo accords to resolve their conflict with Israel by going to the negotiating table and making reasonable and reciprocal compromises with the Jewish state.\n\nIt has been repeated often, but bears saying again: opportunities for the Palestinians to make a deal have been presented numerous times over many years \u2013 at Camp David, after Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza, at Annapolis and with then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s initiative. But the Palestinians have always walked away, because making peace would require their taking less than the zero-sum result they have been promising their people.\n\nThe Europeans know full well \u2013 as the Palestinians certainly do \u2013 that the Israeli population blocs close-in to Israel will not be relinquished in any negotiated settlement. This became clear during the Annapolis conference in 2008 and at all attempts at talks since then. And even if annexation were to occur, that would not preclude the formation of a Palestinian state at some point in the future.\n\nFor the past almost four years, the Palestinian Authority has given a cold shoulder to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to get peace negotiations with Israel started, and then shut down completely on Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d peace plan.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority made it clear that it would simply wait out the Trump administration. The old line that \u201cthe Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity\u201d has never rung truer.\n\nIn the meantime, the world has moved on. Iranian aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen has recalibrated threats and challenges in the region.\n\nRegional strategic alignments are changing, and Israel\u2019s place in the region \u2013 in that camp that recognizes the Iranian threat to what we used to call pro-Western countries \u2013 has marginalized the decades-long urgency to place the Palestinian issue front and center.\n\nExcept in Europe. Its recent threats and bullying of Israel suggest a disconnect from the strategic reality on the ground. A two-state solution today may mean something different than it did 10 or 20 years ago.\n\nThe decades-long absence of goodwill on the Palestinian side, and the continued presence of Hamas in Gaza, means Israel must have a security presence in the Jordan Valley. For the same reasons, demilitarization of whatever Palestinian entity that may result from a negotiation is now a given. And a right of return for Palestinians and their descendants who fled the state of Israel when it was created in 1948 will not happen.\n\nTwo months out, we still have no clear indication of exactly what \u201cannexation\u201d will actually mean. It might include the Gush Etzion bloc and the city of Maale Adumim only, both large population centers very close to Jerusalem. Other options abound. Or, the whole idea could become moot, with the can being kicked down the proverbial road.\n\nWhat we do know is that Europe, which has nothing to show for its now four-decade support of Palestinian statehood, has failed in getting any return on its investment by convincing the Palestinian leadership to drop its nihilistic war against the existence of a Jewish state and negotiate an end to the conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs important, Europe seems incapable \u2013 or worse, unwilling \u2013 to persuade the Palestinians to do what they\u2019ve refused to do until now, which is to finally level with their people about what is do-able and what is fantasy. Only by doing this will Palestinian leaders begin bettering the lives of those they\u2019ve used over decades to advance their own positions of status and power. The way to do this is by ending the conflict with Israel.\n\nEurope has not held the Palestinians accountable, despite protestations to the contrary. As they give a free pass to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2013 which continues to glorify and venerate those who have carried out acts of terror not only against Israelis, but Europeans and Americans as well \u2013 European governments have retreated into their familiar role of hectoring Israel.\n\nWhatever one might think of annexation, Europe\u2019s sanctimonious threats to Israel of sanctions, recalling ambassadors and worse will not move the conflict one inch closer to resolution. Israel deserves better from Europe, where anti-Semitism is rife.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMuch of European anti-Semitism is connected to the steady drumbeat of anti-Israel rhetoric on the Internet and over the public airwaves \u2013 and from statements of political figures \u2013 that have created a threatening environment for Jewish communities across the continent.\n\nTo use a clich\u00e9 from our times, it\u2019s time for Europe to get real. With all the uncertainty swirling around us, are bluster and threats to a sister democracy \u2013 which happens to be sandwiched in the midst of chaos on all sides \u2013 a constructive use of its time?

But they were not the only targets.\n\nKAYLEIGH MCENANY SCOLDS MEDIA FOR LACK OF 'JOURNALISTIC CURIOSITY' IN FLYNN CASE\n\nIt is imperative to uncover the extent of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of U.S. intelligence for political purposes. This must include a full list of every American unmasked from intelligence reports \u2013 Trump aides, members of Congress, and ordinary Americans \u2013 and who made these requests.\n\nIt would be irresponsible for the intelligence community and Congress to turn a blind eye to this abuse simply because it happened years ago. Wrongdoing by the Obama administration in this scandal \u2013 which President Trump has dubbed \u201cObamagate\u201d \u2013 must be exposed to ensure such actions never take place again.\n\nThis week\u2019s revelation that an astounding 39 Obama administration officials \u2013 including then-Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 made 53 requests to unmask incoming Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s name from National Security Agency phone intercepts between Election Day on Nov. 8, 2016 and Jan. 12, 2017 was a bombshell.\n\nThe stunning revelation regarding Obama administration spying on Flynn by secretly recording his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the time appears to confirm allegations by President Trump and his supporters of a broad effort by the Obama administration to weaponize intelligence to undermine the Trump presidency shortly before it began.\n\nFlynn was simply carrying out his duties by making contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition period after Trump was elected president. It is perfectly routine for incoming members of a new presidential administration dealing with foreign affairs to contact foreign officials to introduce themselves before taking office.\n\nMaking this worse, the 53 unmasking requests by Obama administration officials are probably the tip of the iceberg of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of National Security Agency intelligence to target Trump aides.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif. confirmed this in a Fox Business interview this week on \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d when he said the Flynn unmasking scandal is \u201ceven worse than this\u201d because \u201ca whole lot\u201d of other Trump associates were unmasked.\n\nWith this in mind, it is frustrating to see former Obama officials, the mainstream media and some former intelligence officials brush off the Flynn unmasking requests by claiming such requests are \u201cnormal and routine\u201d and that all relevant rules and laws were complied with.\n\nAs a former CIA officer who helped process requests to unmask the names of U.S. citizens from National Security Agency reports, I know that unmasking requests are not normal and routine. And I believe these requests raise serious civil rights and legal issues that have not yet been addressed.\n\nFrom my 25 years working in U.S. government national security jobs, I know how sensitive and rare unmasking requests are.\n\nNames of U.S. citizens mentioned in U.S. intelligence reports \u2013 often National Security Agency communications intercepts \u2013 are redacted because under U.S. law, America\u2019s foreign intelligence services are normally not permitted to spy on U.S. citizens.\n\nAlthough senior U.S. officials are permitted to ask for the identity of a redacted name in an intelligence report (an unmasking request), such requests are unusual and the requestor must have a \u201cneed to know\u201d the identity of the U.S. person to understand the foreign intelligence information or assess its importance.\n\nWhen the request is approved, the unmasked identity is released only to the person who requested it \u2013 not to everyone who might have seen the original version of the report.\n\nFor example, during my time at the State Department from 2001-2006, Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage made about 100 demasking requests. Then-Under Secretary of State John Bolton only made 10 in four years.\n\nIronically, Senate Democrats made Bolton\u2019s unmasking requests an issue during his 2005 nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by falsely claiming these requests were improper and made to intimidate people and gain political advantage.\n\nThen-Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said at the time that unmasking requests were \u201crarely requested\u201d and made \u201cinfrequently\u201d by \u201cnon-career political appointees such as Mr. Bolton.\u201d\n\nAn April 14, 2005, New York Times article said this about unmasking requests in connection with the Bolton confirmation hearings: \u201cThe identities of American officials whose communications are intercepted are usually closely protected by law, and not included even in classified intelligence reports. Access to the names may be authorized by the N.S.A. only in response to special requests, and these are not common, particularly from policy makers.\u201d\n\nThe above statements about the rarity of unmasking requests are consistent with what I witnessed during my government career. In addition, the National Security Agency tightened the rules in 2005 on unmasking because of the controversy over such requests caused by the Bolton hearing.\n\nThe Obama administration, however, appeared to weaken the unmasking rules.\n\nIt is imperative to uncover the extent of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of U.S. intelligence for political purposes\n\nThe Obama administration expanded access to National Security Agency information in February 2016 and on January 12, 2017. Both changes appeared to allow larger numbers of government officials to have access to unmasked names of Americans in intelligence reporting.\n\nEven more troubling was a major rollback by the Obama administration in rules protecting members of Congress from unmasking requests.\n\nI know from my five years on House Intelligence Committee staff of longstanding sensitivity by lawmakers that U.S. intelligence agencies could be used by the executive branch to spy on a president\u2019s political enemies. For this reason, until 2013 there were strict limits to keep members of Congress out of intelligence reporting and to prevent unmasking their names.\n\nUnder a policy in effect in the 1990s, unmasking requests of the names of members of Congress were extremely limited and generally had to be reported to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, these rules were tightened further with \u201ca 2011 NSA directive [that] required direct communications between foreign intelligence targets and members of Congress to be destroyed, but [gave] the NSA director the authority to waive this requirement if he determines the communications contain \u2018significant foreign intelligence.\u201d\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2013 the Obama administration significantly weakened rules on unmasking the names of members of Congress from intelligence reports. The requestor\u2019s reason could now merely be \u201cto fully understand the intelligence.\u201d\n\nRules on notifying Congress also were weakened. National Security Agency officials henceforth would notify Congress when members were unmasked from intelligence reports \u201cas appropriate\u201d and would determine \u201cwhether and to what extent congressional notification would take place.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration appeared to take advantage of these rules changes in 2015 when it obtained private conversations from National Security Agency reports of U.S. lawmakers who opposed the Iran nuclear deal in meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe rule changes on unmasking the names of members of Congress have a direct bearing on the Obama administration\u2019s unmasking of Trump aides.\n\nSince there no longer was a prohibition on using U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on members of Congress, Obama officials probably reasoned there was nothing to prevent them from spying on members of a presidential campaign or an incoming presidential administration. This helps explain the hundreds of unmasking requests regarding Trump aides in 2016 and early 2017.\n\nSo what should happen now?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn addition to an investigation of spying on American citizens by the Obama administration, all Obama administration rule changes making it easier to unmask the names of members of Congress and ordinary Americans from intelligence reports need to be reversed immediately.\n\nThere also should be a requirement in the law restricting when U.S. officials can unmask the names of members of a presidential campaign or incoming administration from intelligence reports or otherwise spy on them. These rules should include a requirement for congressional notification if such spying is deemed necessary in the future.\n\nFinally, I want to know why career intelligence officials cooperated with unmasking Trump campaign and transition officials at the request of the Obama administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSince the prohibition on spying on American citizens and keeping the names of U.S citizens out of intelligence reports are cardinal rules of the U.S. intelligence community, how could career intelligence officers agree to process hundreds of these requests? Why did none of them file complaints with their inspector general or the congressional intelligence oversight committees?\n\nThe hundreds of unmasking requests of Trump campaign and transition officials made by the Obama administration were in no way routine and necessary. I believe carrying out these unmasking requests was a huge ethical lapse by dozens \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 of U.S. intelligence community employees that must be addressed by the White House and the leaders of our intelligence agencies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY FRED FLEITZ", "author": ["Fred Fleitz", "President Of The Center For Security Policy", "Served In As Deputy Assistant To The President", "To The Chief Of Staff Of The National Security Council.

Maybe Speaker Pelosi of San Francisco believes \u2018California Dreamin\u2019 could become the new national anthem.\u201d\n\nThere are a remarkable number of impossible-to-explain provisions in the bill. Some of them would:\n\nProvide money to people in the country illegally.\n\nAllow illegal immigrants to work when more than 30 million Americans are out of work.\n\nProvide taxpayer funding for abortion, even though Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortions by 55 percent to 29 percent.\n\nBlock voter identification laws \u2013 even though 80 percent of Americans favor such laws.\n\nGive state and local governments, which already collect your tax dollars, $1 trillion more of your tax dollars.\n\nGive a tax cut to the richest Americans in blue states.\n\nImpose a host of other liberal fantasies on Americans.\n\nIn fact, the bill is so bad that I had also tweeted: \u201cTrump District Democrats need to be pushed on their support or opposition to the Pelosi $3 trillion bill.\u201d\n\nAs we learned about the nuttier parts of the bill after it was introduced, it struck me almost as a joke.\n\nThis bill could become a disaster for Democratic candidates if Republicans bear down and focus on it. Republicans will hate the bill. Independents and moderates will find large parts of the bill totally unacceptable.\n\nThere will be an entire series of issues in which 75 percent or 85 percent of the country will be deeply opposed to the Pelosi bill.\n\nI\n\nf this choice of which country we should become was the centerpiece of the U.S. House and Senate elections, it would probably guarantee a Republican landslide this fall. In this bill, Pelosi and the Democrats are advocating deeply unpopular issues.\n\nYet, we know Speaker Pelosi has had a long career in Congress (she was first elected 1987) fighting and earning her way to become the first woman speaker of the House (2007-2011), and then endured eight years as minority leader to become speaker for a second time.\n\nPelosi is a survivor. She is tough. She is hardworking, and she has been through a lot of campaigns \u2013 and seen and executed a lot of maneuvers.\n\nTherefore, you must assume there is a sound strategic reason for Pelosi to bring forward a bill that is this radical, expensive, and controversial.\n\nAfter spending days trying to figure out why she would lead her party into such an exposed position, let me offer this three-part proposition.\n\nFirst, Pelosi probably believes this is going to be a base turnout election, and she knows from all the polls that Republicans are more excited about the election than Democrats.\n\nPelosi had this reinforced by the special elections for House seats in Wisconsin and in California.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the GOP handily kept a House seat in an important swing state for the presidential election.\n\nCalifornia should have been a special shock to Pelosi, because the Republicans had not converted a Democratic seat in her home state since 1998. This breakthrough, after 22 years, came in a district Hillary Clinton had carried in the 2016 presidential election. The GOP win was clearly a function of a much more energized Republican base.\n\nFrom Pelosi\u2019s perspective, mobilizing the cannabis users and liberal investors is a useful move, too. They are as much part of the Democratic base as traditional small business owners are part of the Republican base.\n\nArousing the hardcore, pro-abortion activists helps Pelosi with turnout and donations. Disciplined repetition of the word \u201cdiversity\u201d appeals to her ideological activists and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 minority communities.\n\nAppealing to the illegal immigrant community is a useful thing for Pelosi. And Democrats are working to make it possible for illegal immigrants to vote in a number of states.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nGiving a tax cut to the richest people in the bluest states is a direct favor to her donor base and helps the public employee unions in those states by making state and local taxes more bearable.\n\nPouring extra cash into the worst-run blue states with the biggest pension debt (think Illinois and New Jersey) directly helps Pelosi\u2019s public employee union allies and the Democratic politicians in those states.\n\nPelosi has likely calculated that \u2013 as usual \u2013 the Republican candidates will forget to focus. She also must be betting that in a few weeks the Republican and independent voters will have forgotten this monstrosity of a leftwing wish list.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYet, Pelosi\u2019s base will be fired up to elect former Vice President Joe Biden and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate so they can get the ideological and financial goodies she has woven into this bill.\n\nIt is a major gamble on Pelosi\u2019s part.

But that\u2019s the point: so few people in LA have died, relatively speaking, that we\u2019re not certain how many are infected.\n\nWe know they\u2019re not sick enough to crowd hospitals. The city\u2019s health care system has never come close to collapsing.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the curve is now flat, and it has been flat for weeks. It could reopen tomorrow and it should and it would if its leaders were following the science.\n\nBut it\u2019s not reopening.\n\nJust the opposite is happening.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Gil Garcetti has now extended the lockdown through the end of July, which means at least two and a half more months of it.\n\nHe\u2019s using law enforcement, liberally, to make certain that his citizens obey his orders.\n\nPolice say they\u2019ve brought criminal charges against at least 60 \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses for the crime of going to work.\n\nCountless other businesses have shut forever.

Possibly forever, Garcetti announced this week:\n\nGARCETTI: We\u2019ve never been fully closed, we\u2019ll never be completely open until we have a cure. But I do believe that we can take steps, but monitor those numbers, listen to the scientists and the medical professionals, and make the tough calls even when there\u2019s criticism.\n\nYeah, this can\u2019t go on. It\u2019s too crazy.\n\nNow you may mock Los Angeles, and in some cases, it\u2019s deserved, there are some flaky people who live there. -- Barbra Streisand\u2019s in Malibu. But there are also an awful lot of normal, decent people in Los Angeles. Millions of them.\n\nSome of them understand where Garcetti is taking them and their city and they\u2019ve had enough.\n\nA couple of days ago, a group of them came together. It\u2019s totally bipartisan. Some of them are well-known liberal Democrats. Some are conservative Republicans and have been all their lives.\n\nOthers are labor leaders or middle-class voters.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common is the dead-certain knowledge that Mayor Eric Garcetti is poison.\n\nHe\u2019s hurting their city, he\u2019s hurting their families.\n\nGarcetti has allowed tens of thousands of mentally ill drug addicts to live on Los Angeles sidewalks and under overpasses \u2013 if you\u2019ve been there recently, you know about this.\n\nHe\u2019s also tolerated flagrant corruption in his own administration.\n\nNow he\u2019s shut the entire city down simply because he feels like it.\n\nThis group of citizens is going to try to bounce Garcetti from the mayor\u2019s office. And they can! Under California law, politicians can be recalled by voters.\n\nYou remember that Californians did it to their governor, Gray Davis, 17 years ago. It worked.\n\nNow a recall petition in California requires 330,000 signatures. And that, unfortunately, is where Garcetti has the advantage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThanks to his extended shelter in place orders, citizens aren\u2019t allowed to gather these signatures.\n\nSo, under the guise of public health, Garcetti has stopped his political opponents from opposing him.

As long as there is no vaccine, for the Wuhan coronavirus, they can remain in power -- unchallenged -- forever. It\u2019s nice for them. They\u2019re enjoying it.\n\nBut in Los Angeles Garcetti may have gone too far.

Why am I here? How should I treat people? Where am I going? Origin, Meaning, Morality, Destiny.\n\nRavi wrote in the book, \"The issue, then, is not whether the belief system you espouse-monotheistic, atheistic, pantheistic or otherwise--is exclusive. The issue is whether the answers to the four basic questions of life pertaining to origin, meaning, morality, and destiny within the context of each of these world-views meet the tests of truth. Are they logically consistent, are they empirically adequate, and are they experientially relevant?\"\n\nRavi and I talked a lot about that on the \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast last year in connection with his recent book, \"The Logic of God.\"\n\nIt is Ravi who said that all humans, regardless of what religion they practiced or whether they had no religious beliefs, had to answer four basic questions: Where do I come from?

Only one Republican voted for the measure. -- Rep. Pete King of New York.\n\nOn top of that, the White House has said President Trump would veto the bill in the highly unlikely event it wins Senate passage.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has acknowledged that the HEROES (Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions) Act will not become law, but said it can be the basis for negotiations with Senate Republicans and the Trump administration.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF -- THE MOST EXPENSIVE BILL IN HISTORY\n\nDemocrats seem to take the position in the legislation that money is no object when it comes to spending trillions upon trillions of dollars under the cover of helping the American people deal with the coronavirus pandemic. In reality, Democrats are using the pandemic to justify their wish list of far-left Big Government schemes more extreme than anything ever enacted in American history.\n\nThe $3 trillion relief bill would be the costliest in our history as well, and would come on top of the $2.2 trillion CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in March.\n\nPerhaps if members of Congress spent as much time thinking about the impact of these free-spending bills as they did coming up with clever acronyms some of the most absurd provisions of both pieces of legislation could have been avoided.\n\nUnbelievably, some House Democrats on the far-left fringe of the party actually complained that the House bill was too modest. They\u2019d like to spend even more than $3 trillion.\n\n\"Do I think it should be bolder? Yes,\" socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters. \u201cDo I think there should be more, especially as a starting offer? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nAmong the craziest provisions of the 1,800-page HEROES Act are a temporary elimination of the cap on state and local tax deductions on federal income taxes. This is a move that would mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers in blue states \u2013 people like Nancy Pelosi, among other Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe bill would also give an eye-popping $1 trillion bailout to state and local governments to deal with their budget shortfalls caused by the shutdown of businesses and stay-at-home orders designed to halt the spread of the pandemic.\n\nDemocrats clearly don\u2019t believe in belt-tightening by state and local governments to eliminate wasteful programs during hard times. Instead, the Democrats just want to run up the national debt to stratospheric levels. Want to know who will ultimately have to pay higher taxes to pay off that debt? Look in the mirror.\n\nOther parts of the Democratic legislation passed by the House call for up to $10,000 of college debt forgiveness and a whopping $25 billion for the Postal Service.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the legislation would provide yet another round of $1,200 economic stimulus checks for most Americans, as well as an extension of the $600 weekly unemployment insurance bonus to jobless adults until the end of January 2021 \u2013 with an option to extend the bonus payments through March 2021.\n\nThe unemployment bonus \u2013 which is paid on top of other unemployment benefits \u2013 would provide jobless workers with as much as an additional $31,200 over the course of a year for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAfter adding the first and second rounds of stimulus checks and state unemployment benefits to the unemployment bonuses proposed by Democrats, it\u2019s clear that tens of millions of unemployed people in low-wage jobs could end up receiving significantly more money in government benefits than they earned while working.\n\nOne analysis by Ernie Tedeschi, an economist who previously worked for the Treasury Department, estimates that unemployed workers in all but a dozen states now receive about as much or more in government benefits than they did in wages prior to the economic shutdown \u2013 and his analysis didn\u2019t factor in two rounds of $1,200 stimulus checks.\n\nAlready, employers reopening their businesses have reported that they are having a hard time hiring employees for low-paying jobs because working would give so many people less money than they could collect in unemployment payments.\n\nDiscouraging people from working all the way through January 2021 or even longer is the last thing politicians should be doing in the midst of the most significant economic crash since the Great Depression, but that\u2019s exactly what House Democrats are clamoring to do. The biggest reason for the proposal is likely driven by politics, not economic considerations.\n\nThe proof is in Democrats\u2019 timeline. With so many unknowns, why would Democrats choose to call for extending bonus unemployment benefits through January 2021? Why not extend the bonus for a month or two and then reassess how state economies are performing?\n\nAfter all, many states are just now starting to reopen parts of their economies, and it\u2019s still unclear how successful those moves will be.\n\nThe most obvious reason for extending unemployment bonus payments is that January 2021 marks the beginning of the start of the next presidential term. If former Vice President Joe Biden ends up defeating President Trump in November, what better way to begin Biden\u2019s time in office than to have millions of workers forced back into the job market?\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that Pelosi said at a press conference discussing the HEROES Act that it is \u201creally quite an exciting time for us because we have a monumental need for our country at this sad time.\u201d\n\nThis sums up Democrats\u2019 view of the crisis: Sure, the coronavirus pandemic is a tragedy, but what an \u201cexciting\u201d tragedy for those of us looking to expand government at every turn!\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to target government aid to those who have been hit hardest by government decisions to shut down the economy.\n\nAs the old saying goes, \u201cif you break it, you bought it,\u201d and in this case, the government unquestionably \u201cbroke\u201d the economy and forced millions of people out of their jobs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut government relief programs should always be as limited and targeted as possible, and in this case, congressional Democrats and even many Republicans have chosen to do the opposite. They want to hook as many people on government aid programs as possible, instead of focusing on finding effective ways to get the country back to work as safely and quickly as they can.\n\nThe absurdity of sending $1,200 payments to millions of people who haven\u2019t lost their jobs and calling it \u201cstimulus relief\u201d proves just how outrageous this entire gargantuan cash giveaway has become.\n\nWhy would you send \u201crelief\u201d to people who haven\u2019t lost their jobs and thus aren\u2019t in any need of relief?

This was not supposed to be. Polls had Clinton\u2019s likelihood of winning at 77 percent.\n\nTRUMP VOWS TO RESUPPLY NATIONAL STOCKPILE, SAYING 'CUPBOARDS WERE BARE' AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nA key to a Trump victory this year in the Keystone State will be his energy policies, which have brought economic prosperity and created jobs in Pennsylvania. The coronavirus pandemic and the shutdown of businesses to guard against the spread of COVID-19 have derailed economies in every state, but Trump\u2019s pro-energy policies can play a crucial role in reviving the economies of Pennsylvania and the rest of our nation.\n\nIn sharp contrast, Biden and other Democrats have embraced radical energy policies demonizing fossil fuels that would bring economic pain and increased unemployment to Pennsylvania and states around the country. These far-left policies would be disastrous anytime, but would be especially so coming on top of the severe economic pain inflicted on the American people by the coronavirus.\n\nThe former vice president has even appointed socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2013 author of the radical Green New Deal \u2013 as co-chair of his climate policy group that is developing an energy agenda for his campaign. This is no doubt an effort to show his liberal bona fides and win over the far-left Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nHow does Ocasio-Cortez help Biden in Pennsylvania? Well, when the energy industry was imploding last month, prices bottoming and bankruptcies mounting, Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t express sympathy for the millions of jobs lost \u2013 let alone the financial ruin of innumerable businesses. No, she tweeted \u201cyou absolutely love to see it.\u201d\n\nHmmm.\n\nBiden, who was born in Scranton, Pa. \u2013 but moved with his family to Delaware in 1953 at age 10 \u2013 knows Pennsylvania is a vital electoral prize. That\u2019s why he set up his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia and held his first campaign event in Pittsburgh, despite being a senator from neighboring Delaware for nearly 40 years.\n\nBut voters don\u2019t really care where a candidate headquarters his campaign. They care about what a candidate can do to improve their lives. And when it comes to energy policy, the difference between the job-creating policies of Trump and the job-killing policies of Biden couldn\u2019t be more dramatic.\n\nDemographically, Pennsylvania is quite diverse, with major metropolitan areas, depressed Rust Belt towns, and a large rural population. But Pennsylvania also has something else: energy. And lots of it. It\u2019s America\u2019s third-largest coal-producing state. It\u2019s the second-largest shale gas producer. These industries employ thousands of people. And they vote.\n\nMy organization, Power The Future, published a study in January looking at the enormous economic benefits that hydraulic fracturing \u2013 better known as fracking \u2013 has brought to Pennsylvania and compared that to how New York has missed out on the economic benefits because Gov. Andrew Cuomo has unwisely banned fracking.\n\nOur study is titled \u201cNew York\u2019s Buried Opportunity: How Governor Cuomo\u2019s Policies Prevent Prosperity While Pennsylvanians Flourish.\u201d\n\nThe results of this study of neighboring states are important to voters around the nation. That\u2019s because many prominent Democrats are hostile to fracking and would no doubt pressure a President Biden to outlaw the practice nationwide \u2013 even though this method of extracting oil and natural gas has a strong record of safety and has played a crucial role in reducing our dependence on foreign energy.\n\nFracking has generated $1.7 billion in new tax revenue for Pennsylvania since 2012 and a remarkable 36 percent increase in wages for oil and gas employees in the state.\n\nDuring the Great Recession of 2008 to 2012 \u2013 when Pennsylvania was losing jobs overall \u2013 fracking jobs increased an astounding 259 percent, with the vast majority of these jobs in rural areas.\n\nEnergy has been a boon for the state because despite the recession, despite the collapse of the housing market and the Wall Street market tumble, America will always need energy.\n\nJob losses in the energy industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic are temporary. But if Democrats succeed under a Biden administration in banning fracking and taking other anti-fossil fuels actions, the job losses would become permanent. This would have a far more devastating impact on the hardworking men and women who produce the energy that powers America.\n\nPennsylvania is one of the leading energy-producing states, employing tens of thousands of energy workers. They will once again have a crucial role in this upcoming presidential election.\n\nCurrently, 28 percent of Pennsylvania\u2019s overall workforce is unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 a shocking and tragic number. Of the 1.8 million men and women who have filed for unemployment in the state, there\u2019s no doubt some have come from the energy industry.\n\nWe need to get these energy workers back on the job as soon as possible, consistent with public health guidelines needed to combat the spread of COVID-19. The last thing these workers need is permanent unemployment caused by unwise Democratic policies.\n\nBiden has made it clear what he thinks about Pennsylvania and its energy industry, despite putting his campaign headquarters in the state.\n\nOne would expect the Biden campaign to make an aggressive pivot to the center in an appeal for Pennsylvania\u2019s voters, but appointing someone as out-of-touch and downright offensive as Ocasio-Cortez to guide his energy policy shows his complete disconnect with reality.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs President Trump aims to reopen America and restart our economy, he knows we will need energy. The airline industry will come back, but not without energy. Cruise ships, travel, tourism, resorts and hotels all need energy.\n\nMillions of Americans \u2013 once permitted to resume commuting to work \u2013 will need energy for their vehicles. Every business and industry in the nation will only be able to return to full economic strength if Americans can be sure we will have inexpensive, reliable and abundant domestic energy. And Pennsylvania has a lot of it.\n\nNo one wanted the coronavirus to invade America and cripple our economy. The last thing we need is to adopt Democratic energy policies that will further cripple our economy by design.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump can tell Pennsylvania\u2019s energy workers he wants them fully employed, providing for their families, contributing to their communities and building our nation back to its full economic strength.\n\nBiden\u2019s message to these same energy workers is that he will put more of them on the unemployment rolls, and his message to all voters is that he will destroy our energy independence and ship billions of dollars out of our pockets to other countries to buy the energy we should be producing right here in America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DANIEL TURNER", "author": ["Daniel Turner"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/GqIMgkBTjpw/biden-press-corp-trump-tim-graham", "published": "2020-05-15T18:18:12", "title": "Tim Graham: Biden still hiding from a press corps that will never dare grill him like Trump", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s virtual campaign for president is a strange journey, with \u201cvirtual rallies\u201d and \u201cvirtual rope lines\u201d (whatever that is).

Three days later, restaurants and theaters followed. Hospitals once again were allowed to perform all needed surgeries. They could stop pretending that coronavirus was the only medical problem that patients faced. It is not.\n\nThere nothing especially radical about what Georgia did, but you wouldn't know that if you were watching television that week. The decision was described there as the most reckless, public health decision since 9 out of 10 family doctors endorsed Camel cigarettes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nUntold millions would die because Georgia was reopening. The state of Georgia would be flattened by a tidal wave of corpses. It was that dangerous.\n\nEven Stacy Abrams took a break from campaigning for vice president to offer an assessment.\n\nWe should be thrilled by this news because it suggests that America can begin to return to normal, restore the rights stolen from the population, maybe even treat citizens like adults once again, and not court medical disasters. You would think our leadership would be racing to the podium to share this great news. But of course, they are not -- just the opposite.\n\nStacy Abrams, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate: We honestly don't understand the mayors of our largest cities who have all expressed deep concern, that of our scientists.\n\nThis makes no sense and it doesn't improve our economy, it simply puts more Georgians at risk.\n\nYes, she seems to know what she is talking about. You should know, though, that Stacey Abrams is delusional. At one point, she announced that she was the governor of Georgia, which, from a mental health standpoint, is one step from claiming you're Napoleon.\n\nNow, Abrams imagines she is a public health expert. It's best to humor her on that. Just nod and look interested.\n\nChris Hayes is not a scientist, either. He is MSNBC's most ardent male feminist. But he still has strong views on epidemiology.\n\nHayes was so upset by the idea that people in Georgia might go outside without permission that he suddenly found himself arguing that everybody must obey the Trump administration.\n\nChris Hayes, MSNBC host: If that sounds insane to you, you are not alone. And for the record, Georgia does not meet the White House guidelines. It does not a 14-day trajectory of declining cases. It has tested less than 90,000 people out of a population of more than 10 million. Mayors in Georgia are describing the Governor's decision as reckless, dangerous, and illogical.\n\nOh, the voice of overpriced Brooklyn. \"We must do what the White House tells us!\" he screams on MSNBC. That is how dangerous it was. Mark this day, wrote one longtime Washington reporter, because two and three weeks from now, the Georgia death toll is blood on Gov. Brian Kemp's hands.\n\nWell, as it happens, we did, in fact, mark that day. It was April 25, 2020, when the reopenings began. That day, Georgia had 650 new cases of coronavirus. On Wednesday, which was 18 days later, Georgia had a total of 555 cases of coronavirus.\n\nInfections and death in Georgia have been declining since early April -- that's why they began to reopen it. There are still sick people in the state. There will be for a while; some of them will die.\n\nBut as of Thursday night, Georgia's numbers -- the actual numbers -- are no worse than the national average, and that tells us a lot. We should be thrilled by this news because it suggests that America can begin to return to normal, restore the rights stolen from the population, maybe even treat citizens like adults once again, and not court medical disasters.\n\nYou would think our leadership would be racing to the podium to share this great news. But of course, they are not -- just the opposite. In fact, they are doubling down on authoritarianism. They enjoyed being in total control of your life. They do not plan to relinquish the power they received from this pandemic anytime soon, if ever.\n\nAsk yourself how many healthy middle-aged people do you know who have died from this virus? Maybe you know someone. How many people do you know who are now unemployed and terrified of the future? Probably a lot.\n\nThe city of Los Angeles, for example, has extended its lockdown through the end of July. Citizens there will have to wear masks at all times, even when they are outside, where the risk of transmission is minimal.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti did not explain the science behind these commands. There isn't any science. Instead, Garcetti told his city, that until there is a \"cure\" for the virus, life will never go back to normal -- never.\n\nThe mayor did not mention that it is possible -- in fact, it is likely -- that there will never be a cure for the coronavirus. Whatever.\n\nNancy Pelosi didn't ask questions about it. She just quickly endorsed the whole thing.\n\nWillie Geist, MSNBC anchor: There are a lot of people in Los Angeles County who are saying, \"Whoa, three more months. I can't survive this as a small business, I can't survive this as someone who is out of work.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, of course, I agree with the decisions of the people on the ground in their particular venue and location. So yes, it is inconvenient, but it is even more inconvenient if you are going to be infected or worse.\n\nYes, it is inconvenient. But it is not as inconvenient as getting infected with a deadly disease, says Pelosi.\n\nThat's a good talking point, by the way. Hat tip to the 26-year-old staffer who wrote it. But as a factual matter, it is wrong.\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of Americans, the lockdowns are far worse than getting sick with the Wuhan coronavirus. If you are under 60, the odds of dying from this virus are fewer than 1 in 1,000, probably less than 1 in 10,000.\n\nThe odds meanwhile, that government lockdowns are making you poorer and destroying your life -- those chances are far higher than that. Ask yourself how many healthy middle-aged people do you know who have died from this virus? Maybe you know someone. How many people do you know who are now unemployed and terrified of the future? Probably a lot.\n\nThis is insanity. Obviously and at some point, we are going to look back in shame as we consider it. ... The question is for the rest of us: Why are the rest of us allowing this to happen?\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee is not a math guy. He is not calculating probabilities like this. Inslee apparently believes that everyone in Washington state faces the real likelihood of dying from the virus, and that's why he has ordered officials in the state to track who goes to restaurants and who they eat with -- because that is not a Chinese police state tactic or anything.\n\nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee: This contact tracing, obviously, if you have somebody who has become sick and they were sitting right next to a person at a restaurant -- to be able to identify that person could be very valuable for their health to try to save their life, and so we put that in place.\n\nYes, it's kind of weird that the authorities are taking notes on who you are having dinner with. But, you know, it's for the public health, so submit. It's not like politicians will ever misuse that information or anything. So sleep well, but don't forget to send in a blood sample so the government can sequence your DNA for public health reasons.\n\nNobody in America is enjoying all of this more than Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. It is always the most mediocre people who love fascism the most. It gives them power they never dreamed that they would have and indeed, don't deserve.\n\nWhitmer wants this moment to last forever. She is enraged that anyone would dare to complain about it. She went on ABC on Wednesday and dismissed any citizen who disagrees with her, needless to say, as a racist. And then she promised that disobedient citizens in Michigan -- serfs -- will be punished with more severe lockdowns.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: These have been really political rallies where people come with Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism and calling for violence.\n\nThis is racist and misogynistic, and I ask that everybody who has a platform uses it to call on people to observe the best practices promulgated by the CDC and to stop encouraging this behavior because it only makes it that much more precarious for us to try to reengage our economy, which is what everyone says they want us to be able to do.\n\nYes, not only is it racist, it is dangerous to the public health -- and racism.\n\nWhitmer was later asked if she had evidence, proof, that protesters were actually spreading the virus, and you will be surprised to learn she didn't. And by the way, that question is misogynistic, so shut up, bigot.\n\nSome people in Michigan are finally growing tired of this performance. Karl Manke owns a barbershop. He would like to continue cutting hair. Authorities won't let him do that. They prefer to send him welfare checks instead. That is not the country he wants to live in, though.\n\nKarl Manke, Michigan barbershop owner: I am 77. I've always worked. I have never looked for handouts. I don't even know what they are. I haven't -- somebody called me and said, well, why didn't you get on food stamps? Well, I don't want food stamps. I want to work.\n\nWhen our governor said we are going to have another 28 days, it knocked me to my knees. I couldn't take another 28 days. All of us as Americans need to begin to take responsibility for ourselves, you know? I feel that the government is not my mother. It never has been, you know. And matter of fact, this administration, for the most part, I've been in business longer than they've been alive.\n\nGretchen Whitmer was not amused by that. \"The government is not my mom\" -- misogyny. And by the way, cutting hair is racist.\n\nSo Whitmer's administration tried to shut Manke down with a court order because there's nothing else going on in Michigan right now. A judge resisted that it was too far.\n\nSo, Whitmer's lackey simply revoked Manke's barber's license. Now, he is shut down for good and will be even when the lockdowns finally end. That will show him. Stop whining and take your welfare check, bigot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is insanity.

Now, more than ever, it is important to protect, support and uplift children and families by providing services pivotal to their stability.\n\nAs a part of President Trump\u2019s whole-of-government and whole-of-America approach to the coronavirus, ACF has thought strategically, innovatively and out-of-the-box about ways to support our programs and our communities during this time of crisis. Through actions like granting regulatory flexibilities and waivers, sending guidance, hosting webinars and much more, we have been able to continue serving America\u2019s children and families during this time.\n\nROBERT O'BRIEN: VENTILATORS FOR CORONAVIRUS \u2014 US IS ARSENAL OF HEALTH IN WAR ON COVID-19\n\nIn recognizing the critical importance of protecting the health of our child welfare workers and service providers, ACF worked with Eric Hargan, deputy secretary for HHS, to send a letter to governors. We encouraged them to work with their emergency management programs to classify child welfare workers and service providers as level 1 emergency responders in order for them to have greater access to personal protective equipment.\n\nWe also looked for opportunities within our programs like Head Start, which promotes school readiness of children under 5, where we can use their resources and talent to serve our communities in supporting emergency child care. Recently our Office of Head Start clarified how programs can support, when possible, the use of closed Head Start centers as temporary child care centers for medical personnel and essential workers. These efforts will help support our front-line workers with a safe and child-friendly environment so they can continue their important work.\n\nACF also took action by urging child welfare legal and judicial leaders to work together to ensure that necessary court hearings continue during this pandemic. We encouraged access to visits and other activities virtually where physical contact is not possible and in addition to physical contact, as well as clarified questions around the evolving crisis where courts have had to restrict parent/child face-to-face contact.\n\nWe also advised child welfare leaders of the flexibility of certain requirements regarding fingerprint-based criminal records checks and caseworker visits to a child\u2019s home.\n\nThrough our actions during this pandemic, we have developed countless new ideas that are adaptable to how we serve vulnerable populations nationwide in the months and years to come.\n\nFinding ways to be innovative virtually has made a difference in helping to meet the needs of children in foster care during this time, because life doesn\u2019t stop for them during pandemics.\n\nThe historic coronavirus relief package, the CARES Act, which President Trump signed into law on April 23, delivered a strong financial foundation of over $6 billion for our programs affected by COVID-19, including child care and child welfare.\n\nIn an effort to support the learning of children disrupted by the crisis, the bill includes up to $500 million for summer Head Start programs. We also secured $3.5 billion in supplemental funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant to help states, territories and tribes address COVID-19 impacts on child care. Among other purposes, these supplemental funds can be used to provide child care assistance to health care workers, first responders and other essential workers playing critical roles during this crisis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe also understand how important it is to inform our grantees and the vulnerable populations we serve about the actions taken and assistance we are providing, which is why we dedicated a web page to providing a comprehensive list of resources, information and services.\n\nThrough our actions during this pandemic, we have developed countless new ideas that are adaptable to how we serve vulnerable populations nationwide in the months and years to come. Going forward, we want to continue implementing better, stronger and more innovative ways to deliver human services.

There were newspaper stories and TV documentaries about how long survivors of a nuclear war would have to stay inside reinforced shelters until the fallout dissipated to a point it was safe to go out. Then, it was Geiger counters that would determine the level of radioactivity.\n\nCAL THOMAS: AMID CORONAVIRUS, GREATEST GENERATION STILL HAS LESSONS TO TEACH US\n\nToday\u2019s Geiger counters are temperature gauges held to our foreheads. Symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing and fever, as well as high-risk factors, such as age and underlying health conditions, are also part of the diagnostic equation.\n\nWe are told to frequently wash our hands, not touch our faces, don\u2019t shake hands with anyone, practice social distancing \u2014 we can recite these from memory \u2014 but then we are also told to stay inside and only go out for \u201cnecessities,\u201d such as food and prescriptions.\n\nGrocery stores where I shop require masks when entering and one-way traffic aisles. A hard plastic \u201cwall\u201d separates me from the cashier, who is also wearing a mask. Hand sanitizers and wipes are available at the entrance and exit where cart handles are wiped down after each use.\n\nIf these practices are almost as good as staying home, why can\u2019t businesses employing these practices, including restaurants and bars, be opened so people can make a living and not rely on government, whose debt now exceeds levels that will never be reduced without spending cuts (and likely tax increases if Democrats win the November election)? Restaurants can place tables six feet apart. Those operating in warmer climates could add outside tables, benches and chairs. For the fearful, takeout orders could be ramped up.\n\nAs experts have noted, it could be months and possibly longer before a vaccine is created. And there probably is more than one strain, as with influenza, so a single vaccine is unlikely to protect everyone from every strain.\n\nLast Sunday, my wife and I went to a local restaurant. Tables had been removed. We wore masks as did staff behind the counter. We purchased our food, left the place and ate outside without masks where tables and benches were available. There were others there, not all of whom were six feet apart. People engaged in social interaction, which is what humans do and need to do. No one seemed fearful.\n\nAs experts have noted, it could be months and possibly longer before a vaccine is created. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a Senate committee Tuesday there is no guarantee a vaccine will work. And there probably is more than one strain, as with influenza, so a single vaccine is unlikely to protect everyone from every strain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDoes that mean staying at home until perfect safety can be guaranteed?

At the war\u2019s beginning, no one believed Germany would utterly collapse in May 1945.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, German invaders were on the verge of capturing Moscow. Britain was isolated. London had barely survived a terrible German bombing during the blitz.\n\nA sleeping America was neutral, but it was beginning to realize it was weak and mostly unarmed in a scary world.\n\nREBECCA GRANT: WORLD WAR II IN EUROPE ENDED EXACTLY 75 YEARS AGO \u2013 IT HAS LESSONS FOR WAR AGAINST CORONAVIRUS\n\nBut by 1943, a booming U.S. economy was fielding vast military forces from Alaska to the Sahara. Britain and America were bombing the German heartland. The Soviet Red Army had trapped and destroyed a million-man German army at Stalingrad.\n\nHow did the Allies \u2014 Britain, the Soviet Union and the U.S. \u2014 turn around the European war so quickly?\n\nThe huge Red Army would suffer close to 11 million deaths in halting German offensives. Britain would never give up despite terrible losses at home and at sea from German bombers, rockets and submarines.\n\nYet the key to victory was the U.S. economy. It would eventually outproduce all the major economies on both sides of the war combined.\n\nBut how did the U.S. arm so quickly, build such effective weapons so soon, and from almost nothing field a military some 12 million strong?\n\nNeo-socialist President Franklin D. Roosevelt unleashed American business under the aegis of successful entrepreneurs such as Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Co., William Knudsen of General Motors, Henry Kaiser of Kaiser Shipyards and Charles Wilson of General Electric.\n\nThey were all given relatively free rein from New Deal strictures to work and profit without burdensome government regulations. The result was a military juggernaut that overwhelmed America\u2019s enemies.\n\nPolitics went on but in a less partisan fashion. Republicans picked up seats in the House and Senate in 1942, while Roosevelt won a fourth presidential term in 1944.\n\nRoosevelt was able to dodge charges of rank partisanship during the war by appointing Republicans to key positions in his administration. Republican Henry Stimson became secretary of war. Former Republican vice presidential candidate Frank Knox was the all-important secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt stocked the War Production Board with Republican capitalists.\n\nGovernment cannot restore prosperity. Only entrepreneurs and risk-takers can. Americans must master their fears of the virus and dare to go back to work.\n\nThe media turned from either propagandizing the success of the New Deal or hyping its failures to warning Americans of the looming existential threat that would soon make their differences irrelevant.\n\nMost importantly, Americans lost their fears.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1938, the U.S. economy was in ruins. FDR\u2019s New Deal could not restore economic growth or consumer confidence. As late as 1938, economic growth had sunk to negative 3.3 percent. Unemployment soared to an unsustainable 19 percent.\n\nOnly the threat of war terrified Americans into taking a gamble \u2014 to work feverishly and to ramp up industry.\n\nBy the end of 1941, the early rearmament effort had spiked GDP growth to 17.7 percent. Unemployment had fallen to about 10 percent and would soon fall to about 2 percent.\n\nAmericans began losing their dread that they could do nothing against a decade-long depression.

Bin Laden\u2019s rationale for his horrific plot was telling: \u201cBiden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis.\u201d\n\nNow, a decade since U.S. Special Forces killed bin Laden in Pakistan, it\u2019s my guess that President Xi Jinping of China \u2013 our greatest geopolitical foe today \u2013 also wants former Vice President Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States. This makes perfect sense when you consider that Xi wants what\u2019s best for China.\n\nJoe Biden has been wrong on U.S. policy toward China virtually his entire career. In fact, Biden and other establishment politicians in Washington have been instrumental in China\u2019s meteoric rise from a developing nation into a Communist power with global ambitions.\n\nSEN. THOM TILLIS: CORONAVIRUS AND CHINA \u2014 US RECOVERY INCLUDES HOLDING BEIJING ACCOUNTABLE\n\nFor decades, China has executed a foreign policy focused on replacing the United States as the world\u2019s leading economy.\n\nDuring his time as lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden gave a floor speech in September 2000 in support of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. He said, \u201cFinally, I would like to point out that my support for permanent normal trade relations with China is based not just on an assessment of the economic benefits to the U.S., not just on the prospects for political reform in China, but also on the impact on our national security.\u201d\n\nTwenty years later, on each of the three prongs he laid out to justify his support for the legislation, it\u2019s clear that Biden was dead wrong.\n\nStatistics show that 3.7 million American jobs have been lost to China since 2001 due to our horrendous anti-U.S. worker policies. Furthermore, China has imprisoned upwards of one million Muslim Uighurs and other minorities in \u201cre-education camps.\u201d It also, according to reports, jailed more than 48 journalists in 2019 alone just for seeking the truth. And today we face a global pandemic with more than 80,000 Americans dying from COVID-19 because China chose to lie instead of help save lives.\n\nSo much for Biden\u2019s promises of economic prosperity, political reform and national security.\n\nAbout a decade after his pro-PNTR vote, in 2011, Vice President Biden doubled down on his cozy rhetoric toward China in an op-ed he wrote for The New York Times. Biden shamelessly reiterated his unwise support for the Chinese government, stating, \u201cI remain convinced that a successful China can make our country more prosperous, not less.\u201d He added, \u201cI am convinced, from nearly a dozen hours spent with Vice President Xi Jinping, that China\u2019s leadership agrees.\u201d\n\nBiden is choosing to ignore the fact that President Trump singlehandedly changed the debate and rallied America around his get-tough-on Beijing policy.\n\nBiden, who first visited China in 1979, couldn\u2019t see that the Communist leadership there was playing him for a fool. He closed the editorial by saying, \u201cSome may warn of America\u2019s demise, but I\u2019m not among them. And let me reassure you: based on my time in China, neither are the Chinese.\u201d\n\nLet Biden\u2019s naivety sink in and juxtapose it with President Trump\u2019s actions on China \u2013 which show he\u2019s been right from the beginning. You would think that Biden would observe this president\u2019s leadership and success in negotiating with China and change his ways \u2013 but you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nBiden is choosing to ignore the fact that President Trump singlehandedly changed the debate and rallied America around his get-tough-on Beijing policy.\n\nExactly one year ago at a May campaign rally, Biden boasted, \u201cChina is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man ... they can\u2019t figure out how they\u2019re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d\n\nIn our current reality, this statement personifies how wrongheaded Biden remains on China.\n\nA typical liberal like Sleepy Joe in the White House would return to failed globalist policies and China would pass the United States as the world\u2019s leading economic superpower and never look back.\n\nA Biden administration would accept the failed status quo at the United Nations that President Trump has called out; a Biden administration would fund the World Health Organization and accept business as usual, and a Biden administration would consent to new job-killing global compacts that would destroy Trump\u2019s policies that prioritize the working men and women in America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe bottom line is that Biden\u2019s disastrous policies would take us back to the days of economic stagnation.\n\nTrump came into office with the goal of making America great again.

It was a promise that the failed economy of the Obama-Biden administration, characterized by slow growth and vanishing job opportunities, would not be tolerated.\n\nUpon entering office, President Trump confronted Chinese Communist leaders with his ironclad promise to the American people that he would bring our economy roaring back to life.

The mandate would make it harder for employers to stay afloat amid changing circumstances and meet their employees\u2019 unique needs. Workers could expect more job losses, and those out of work would have a harder time finding jobs.\n\nUnder the proposal, the paid leave mandate that took effect April 1 would not sunset until the end of 2021. Throughout this year and next, employers would be required to provide both full- and part-time employees with up to 12 weeks of emergency paid sick and family leave.\n\nAlthough employers can fill out paperwork and send in documentation to receive a credit for some or all of the paid leave they provide, it\u2019s neither a straightforward nor simple process. Rather, Congress dictates the terms and conditions, which often overlap and interfere with employers\u2019 own policies and other provisions Congress has enacted.\n\nFor example, Congress dictates that workers qualify to receive the benefits their first day on the job and says the benefits must be given on top of any preexisting sick leave benefits, which cannot be changed by employers.\n\nBut COVID-19 has forced businesses and households alike to readjust their finances, and some businesses need to temporarily adjust their employees\u2019 benefits packages.\n\nThe mandate also dictates that employers allow the leave to be taken intermittently or as a reduced work schedule. Moreover, employers cannot ask for documentation of an employee\u2019s need for leave until seven days after the employee has returned from work.\n\nEmployers also cannot discipline, discharge or otherwise discriminate against any worker who takes paid sick or family leave, and they must restore workers who take leave to the same or equivalent position after their leave.\n\nThese mandates derail the organic process of businesses finding ways to meet their unique situations and needs. Instead of using their existing paid leave policies and focusing on adjusting to remote work options and keeping their businesses alive, employers are having to figure out how to comply with the new mandate.\n\nRather than help workers stay employed, this extended mandate could exacerbate unemployment.\n\nNearly a quarter of all U.S. workers have already filed for unemployment in just the last nine weeks. For nearly 37 million newly unemployed Americans, government-mandated paid leave benefits are meaningless; their priority is finding a job and getting their careers back on track.\n\nThat will become much less likely if Congress moves to make it even more expensive and more complicated for businesses to rehire. And regrettably, it could put women \u2013 who are more likely to be primary caregivers \u2013 at a disadvantage in the job market.\n\nThis paid leave mandate simply isn\u2019t necessary. Federal law already requires employers with more than 50 employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid family and medical leave.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMost employers want to do right by their employees and that\u2019s why the overwhelming majority of full-time workers already have paid leave benefits. But employers don\u2019t need to be altruistic to realize that it\u2019s in their best interests to allow and even encourage sick workers to stay home. That\u2019s never been truer than during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRather than meddle in the employee-employer relationship with a sweeping mandate that burdens small businesses, encourages layoffs, and curtails workplace flexibility, policymakers ought to focus on the real vulnerabilities that people face. That is, the risk that unreasonably prolonged, forced shutdowns will cause thousands of businesses to shutter their doors for good and that potentially millions of jobs will be lost and could take years to recover.\n\nCongress should make it easier for workers to prepare for time off by expanding opportunities to save pre-tax income, allowing workers to opt for comp time rather than additional overtime pay (a policy change including in the Working Families Flexibility Act) and reducing costly mandates, taxes, and regulations that prevent employers from having the resources necessary to provide paid leave.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd Congress can help workers accommodate to evolving work situations \u2013 including remote work and more flexible schedules to adjust to children being home \u2013 by easing restrictions on home-based businesses and clarifying the definition of an employee so that workers have more options to earn a living and be their own bosses, if that\u2019s what they want.\n\nAmericans want the opportunity to work and provide for themselves and their families. They know that employers face real challenges staying afloat and keeping workers paid.

Biden\u2019s abuse of government power to go after a political rival is more than a little disturbing.\n\nThis scandal reaching, perhaps, all the way to President Obama himself, is why innocent Americans wonder just how much their own government has been spying on them and vacuuming up their most sensitive information.\n\nDespite Edward Snowden\u2019s devastating revelations, Congress has largely abdicated its responsibility to protect the Bill of Rights, and small tweaks to the system have not stopped abuse or waste of vital resources that could have been spent actually protecting our country. Yet Congress has patted itself on the back even as it steamrolled meaningful debate on one of the biggest issues of our time.\n\nRAND PAUL: FLYNN UNMASKING WAS 'DEVASTATING ABUSE OF POWER' BY BIDEN, OBAMA OFFICIALS\n\nThis week, the U.S. Senate will take up the U.S. House-passed government surveillance bill extending certain expired Patriot Act powers. Once again, the bill plays with reform but falls far short of bringing real change to a system that currently relies on secret courts and the hope that the government will police itself.\n\nSo I will offer an amendment to protect all Americans and help rebuild the trust our institutions have shattered over the years.\n\nMy amendment would empower the government to conduct necessary surveillance on non-Americans and our enemies, but it would force federal officials who want to surveil an American to get a warrant from a regular court as established by our Constitution instead of the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISC).\n\nIt would also protect Americans\u2019 privacy and restore due process by preventing the government from introducing into evidence any information it gathered from surveilling an American without a warrant. Americans would, however, be allowed to use evidence collected this way to defend themselves.\n\nMy amendment would also make it illegal to use this secret, foreign court to investigate any political speech or campaign.\n\nThe alarm about abuses of our system has only grown as we have learned about the Obama administration\u2019s spying on Donald Trump as he ran for office and then transitioned into the presidency. They used the FISA court, which meets in secret and was intended for use against foreigners.\n\nLate last year, Department of Justice Inspector General Michael Horowitz made headlines when his office released a report that, among other findings, \u201cidentified at least 17 significant errors or omissions\u201d in four applications the FBI made to the FISC to spy on former Trump campaign adviser Carter Page.\n\nThe system as constructed lends itself too easily to mistakes and abuse that we discover far too late, and this is too important an issue for only cosmetic changes.\n\nNot long after, we learned the Department of Justice stated that in two of the applications, \u201c\u2018if not earlier, there was insufficient predication to establish probable cause to believe that Page was acting as an agent of a foreign power.\u2019\u201d\n\nAnd, for some reason, the fact that a sitting president spied on an incoming national security adviser\u2019s conversation continues to be regarded as just a footnote in the controversy over the FBI\u2019s egregious treatment of Lt. Gen. Flynn.\n\nAs set up right now, and as would still be the case under the House bill, our secretive system leaves the door wide open for abuses that are only revealed long after the damage is done.\n\nThe Carter Page story led DOJ IG Horowitz to dig further, and he uncovered more shocking information concerning 29 other applications \u201crelating to U.S. persons,\u201d with the IG finding \u201capparent errors or inadequately supported facts in all of the 25 applications we reviewed.\u201d\n\nThe FBI couldn\u2019t find what is supposed to be required documents for the other four applications that back up the claims made, with it not even sure those documents \u201cever existed\u201d for three of those four, according to the IG.\n\nDo not misunderstand me here. Our government is filled with lots of good, hardworking men and women, and the FBI is making efforts to help prevent future problems. But the system as constructed lends itself too easily to mistakes and abuse that we discover far too late, and this is too important an issue for only cosmetic changes.\n\nWe need substantive reform and not window dressing.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI don\u2019t believe tinkering around the edges with process reforms can make FISA constitutional. FISA employs a less-than-constitutional standard. Instead of the Fourth Amendment\u2019s requirement of probable cause that a crime was committed or being committed, the FISA standard allows for investigations if there is probable cause that an individual is working for a foreign government.\n\nI believe the only way to fix FISA is to exempt Americans from this court that was intended to investigate foreigners.\n\nI, for one, am tired of hearing after-the-fact outrage, only to see it vanish when it comes time to vote.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Patriot Act debate cuts right to the heart of what we stand for as a nation.

To help you get the most out of your movie-watching experience, I\u2019ve sorted these films under key topics and categorized them as being available to rent through Amazon, or available to watch for free through Amazon Prime.\n\nThese 10 movies go beyond entertainment: They set high standards and showcase the skills and drive you\u2019ll need to be a success, as well as warn against greed and corruption.\n\nStories that bring Wall Street to life\n\nFrom corrupt stockbrokers to astute hedge fund managers, these movies capture some of Wall Street\u2019s most intriguing true stories.\n\n1. The Wolf of Wall Street \u2013 available for rent through Amazon\n\nThis hit movie tells a wild, over-the-top tale that happens to be based on a true story. The plot revolves around scam-artist stockbroker Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), who takes an entry level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm.\n\nWhat to watch for: Belfort was a great entrepreneur who successfully built something out of nothing, but unfortunately his company was riddled with corruption and deceit. This story offers entrepreneurs important lessons, not the least of which is: Don\u2019t be a crook.\n\n2. The Big Short \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThe Big Short tells the story of a group of Wall Street fund managers and investors who were able to see the looming housing market crisis long before it began to implode in 2007 and 2008. The movie chronicles the work of hedge fund manager Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale), who discovers that financial institutions are bundling risky subprime mortgages into \u201cAAA-rated\u201d prime mortgage\u2212backed securities that were sold to investors. He realizes the U.S. housing market is perched atop a huge asset bubble that is about to burst.\n\nWhat to watch for: Burry creates a credit default swap that allows him to short, or bet against, those bonds, making his investors a bundle of money when the housing market tanks. The biggest lesson here is that while everyone else scoffed at him because they believed the market was unbreakable, Burry stuck to his guns and his strategy paid off.\n\nThe story behind American icon Walt Disney\n\nWalt Disney was a pioneer in animation and in the entertainment industry. These movies take a deeper look at his backstory and the creative process he used to create his iconic characters.\n\n3. Saving Mr. Banks \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nThis movie tells the story behind Walt Disney\u2019s quest to obtain the rights to P.L. Travers\u2019 novel Mary Poppins. Despite Disney\u2019s best efforts, Travers rebuffs every offer he makes because she fears Disney\u2019s version of her story won\u2019t be true to the characters she has created. She criticizes every step in the process to adapt the book into a movie script, nearly upending the project.\n\nWhat to watch for: The delicate way Disney handles this situation. He could have easily let the project sink or tried to pressure Travers to comply. Instead, he seeks to better understand her concerns and hear her out. He eventually finds a way to win her over, and his tenacity results in a movie that won universal acclaim and audience adoration for generations to come.\n\n4. Walt Before Mickey \u2013 available for free through Amazon Prime\n\nWhile you have likely heard about Walt Disney\u2019s many accomplishments, you may not be familiar with the many difficulties he faced on the way to success. Walt Before Mickey depicts a number of failures Disney had to overcome as he doggedly built a career for himself in animated films. This is the story of Disney\u2019s early years. Before he created Mickey Mouse, Disney created another famous animated character, Oswald Rabbit. But Disney didn't own the copyright to that character, and he had to let Oswald go.\n\nWhat to watch for: Owning your work is one of the many lessons he learned on the bumpy road to success \u2014 and a good one for entrepreneurs to take away from this film. By the time Walt created Mickey, he was on his fourth animation company and it is the one that stuck: Walt Disney Studios.\n\nStories behind famous business feuds\n\nThroughout history, businesses have feuded for a variety of reasons. Sometimes these conflicts become epic and can drive businesses to the brink \u2014 or propel them to new heights.\n\n5. Ford v Ferrari \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nIn the 1960s, automaker Ford's then-president Henry Ford II tried to buy luxury sports car manufacturer Ferrari, but the deal fell through at the last minute. Ford v Ferrari stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale and chronicles how Henry Ford II's disappointment turned into revenge, prompting him to create a new car that could beat Ferrari's model at Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car endurance race.\n\nWhat to watch for: Consider how Ferrari executives don\u2019t take Ford seriously as a competitor, and the impact that has. The movie also shows how Ford\u2019s project passes through numerous middle managers, which likely reduces the overall efficiency of their operations.\n\n6. Adidas vs. Puma: The Brothers\u2019 Feud \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThe movie depicts the story behind two of the world\u2019s most renowned shoe companies, which stems from a vicious family feud that not only pitted two brothers against one another but also divided the inhabitants of their small hometown in Germany. Note: this is a German-language film with English subtitles.\n\nWhat to watch for: The rivalry between these two brands went far beyond corporate competition, but it also undoubtedly pushed both companies to excel. The movie shows how different business approaches resulted in the development of two of the most powerful sports brands in the world. It ultimately begs the question: If it weren\u2019t for this family rivalry, would these companies be where they are today?\n\nThe story behind the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that McDonald\u2019s is the largest fast-food chain in the world and has revolutionized our eating habits \u2014 for better or for worse. The origin story behind McDonald\u2019s offers great insights into how innovation is born when people are willing to think outside the box to solve customer problems.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s empire we know today exists largely because of a man whose last name is not McDonald. In 1948, the McDonald brothers debuted a revolutionary kitchen assembly line during a time when drive-ins were still king. Enter Ray Kroc, who delivered several milkshake mixers to the McDonald brothers in 1954. Kroc was in awe of what they had created, and he had a vision for how he could take their \u201cgolden arches\u201d from coast to coast. Kroc eventually bought the business \u2014 and the rights to the McDonald\u2019s name. Today the company is worth more than $100 billion, and Kroc is considered its founder.\n\nWhat to watch for: Not only does the movie show how important it is to never give up; it also throws light on other aspects of business, such as the importance of having a good team, and why it\u2019s crucial to have all legalities in place.\n\n8. The Real Founder \u2013 watch for free through Amazon prime\n\nThe Real Founder features an interview with Dick McDonald, who, along with his brother Maurice, started the McDonald\u2019s restaurant chain. Dick McDonald offers his side of the story, describing how they opened a drive-in restaurant in Southern California, which became one of the most popular in town.\n\nWhat to watch for: If you\u2019ve seen The Founder, this documentary will give you a different perspective. The Real Founder offers the backstory on how the McDonald brothers came up with their own innovations to speed up food service, and even began franchising the restaurant long before Ray Kroc was part of the story.\n\nStories of women inventors who succeeded and failed\n\nThe key elements of success often come down to having drive, ambition and talent; however, as these movies show, you need to back that up with a solid product that performs as advertised.\n\n9. Joy \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nThis movie captures the challenges of a woman entrepreneur and has a wonderful message for all women looking to build a successful company. Joy is based on the life of Joy Mangano, a self-made millionaire who created a business empire.\n\nWhat to watch for: This movie is about beating all odds and breaking the glass ceiling. But the best lesson here is that if you want to build a big, successful company, you need to get ready to go to war every day, rain or shine. Success means being willing to fight a multi-front battle.\n\n10. The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThis documentary follows the story of Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, a blood-testing startup business. She led the public to believe that her device, the Edison, could perform dozens of blood tests with just a single finger prick. She was later criminally charged because it was all a lie.\n\nWhat to watch for: Holmes was gifted at creating a narrative that pulled people in and made them want to believe her. Entrepreneurs can learn from the way she masterfully drew investors to back her. But she also refused to listen to anyone who questioned her practices. Successful entrepreneurs listen to feedback and encourage open and thoughtful dialogue.\n\nRelated: 10 Movies All Entrepreneurs Should Watch on Hulu", "author": ["Deep Patel"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/DAYayu1NQ9c/348153", "published": "2020-05-16T15:30:00", "title": "Embracing Your Creativity in Uncertain Times", "text": "May 16, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWith every product and every service, there are so many unknowns.\n\nWill people purchase my product or service?\n\nIs it the right time to launch?\n\nDo I have the experience to take this to market?\n\nDo I have enough money to launch this business?\n\nIs the market ready for this product or service?\n\nEvery entrepreneur with a new product or service has to navigate through uncertainty. It's truer now than ever.\n\nTiming is important, but no one ever truly knows when the right time is.\n\nWill you have enough money? In most situations, no. Will you be able to find the financing you need? Many times, no.\n\nWith every product and every service, there are so many unknowns. Which is another way of saying, there\u2019s always risk.\n\nRelated: To Get Through COVID-19, Entrepreneurs Need to Embrace These 2 Truths\n\nAs a lifelong entrepreneur who has licensed products and built businesses in different industries, I know the feeling well. But one instance comes to mind in particular.\n\nMany years ago, a good friend visited my office to ask me if I could design some new guitar picks.\n\nI thought, Is he for real? I didn\u2019t know anything about guitar picks. Sure, yes, I liked products. But given the chance, why would anyone choose that business specifically? Guitar picks were pieces of plastic that sold for pennies. And I knew nothing about the music industry.\n\nHis timing was good, though. One of my inventions had recently stopped producing royalties for me, my wife wasn\u2019t working, and we had just moved into a new house. So truthfully, my back was up against the wall. I had some extra time on my hands, and it wasn\u2019t clear how I was going to pay our mortgage.\n\nIn times like these, you have to trust yourself. Your best creative work can happen in uncertainty.\n\nGiven the circumstances, my attitude was: \u201cSure, why not?\u201d That\u2019s the right attitude to have when it\u2019s time to get creative.\n\nSo, I jumped right in and began designing our first line of guitar picks. Guitars made me think of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, which was sexy. Bingo, I thought: Women in bikinis. Guitar picks were curvy, like bodies. (Looking back, I cringe.)\n\nBut, as it turns out, my initial instincts were completely off. These picks didn\u2019t sell at all. When I placed a display with samples in a few local music stores, no one bought them.\n\nEvery successful entrepreneur is familiar with failure, having received more than a few rejections. And sure enough, this was one of mine.\n\nI realized that I hadn\u2019t studied the marketplace. At the time, I was 50 years old. What did I know about youth culture? I needed to study the social trends of a younger audience. So I went down to my local mall in Modesto, California, and walked into Hot Topic. I saw skulls everywhere! And that\u2019s when inspiration hit.\n\nI was going to design a new guitar pick in the shape of a skull. I even came up with a great name: The Grave Picker.\n\nWhen I looked into how guitar picks were packaged, I discovered they were often sold in jumble, stored behind the counter in a tackle box. I realized I could stand out by packaging my product differently too.\n\nBasically, guitar picks weren\u2019t lifestyle. They were utilitarian.\n\nIf I could design uniquely shaped picks that appealed to the lifestyles of different consumers, my market would be much larger than just guitar players. I would be able to sell picks to music fans.\n\nThat hunch bore out. In less than four years, we grew Hot Picks, our company, into one of the largest sellers of guitar picks in the world. Walmart, 7-Eleven and music stores everywhere ended up selling our picks.\n\nRelated: Every Era Brings Challenges. If You Don't Forget Your 'Thing,' You Will Prevail.\n\nTo land retailers that didn\u2019t normally even sell picks, we had to overcome uncertainty. I remember walking into my local 7-Eleven and asking if I could try to sell my picks there by leaving a display on the counter over the weekend. The manager told me he didn\u2019t think they were going to sell, but he agreed to let me try. By Sunday, the picks were gone \u2014 they had sold out!\n\nWe marketed our picks in novel ways too. At the time, the social media platform Myspace was just becoming popular, and we took full advantage of it by sponsoring garage bands with free merch and free advertising. In time, their fans became our army of fans.\n\nTaking a chance on yourself pays off, especially when your back is up against the wall. This is what I\u2019ve learned about harnessing through uncertainty.\n\n1. There\u2019s power in observation. Learning from what you can observe around you is key. You may think you have a good idea, but you should never rely on an assumption. What are consumers actually doing?\n\n2. To minimize risk, test your hunches on a small scale first. We were able to produce a small run of our first designs. When they failed to sell, we lost a little bit of money, but not much. That made going back to the drawing board to come up with a different set of designs easy.\n\n3. Think differently. Simply changing how guitar picks were designed allowed us to sell to a much larger market. Stores that normally didn\u2019t carry picks sold multiple styles of our designs.\n\n4. Pick the right partner. While I knew nothing about the music business the day my friend walked in the door, he was a musician who had owned two music stores. He knew distributors and the trade shows, which helped us tremendously. (Crucially, he knew how to collect money from accounts that were late.) Pick your partners carefully. If you don\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of an industry, find and partner with someone you trust who does.\n\n5. Be unafraid to break the mold. You have to take a chance on your creativity. Not having firsthand experience was actually an asset for me in this situation. I was able to think about guitar picks differently because I didn\u2019t play guitar. I let myself be creative and have fun.\n\nI\u2019ve never forgotten the times when my back was up against the wall, rent was due and I had to try something new. That's why, through feast or famine, my work ethic never wavers. Every entrepreneur launches a product in an uncertain time.

Charisma. Character. Collaboration. So much of what builds personal brands and reputations focuses on human connection and interaction. But how can we maintain relationships when we\u2019re apart?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic hit us all, in every corner of the world, in real and unexpected ways. Previously, we built engagement with others through eye contact, image, conversation and relationship. Now we find ourselves isolated and conversing with our cats, dogs and children instead of prospective clients, networking contacts, students, audiences and co-workers.\n\nBuilding or maintaining reputation without in-person interaction\n\nToday, it is still critical to be concerned with our reputation and brand as we navigate the new normal. These six tips can help.\n\n1. Virtual meetings. We are all undoubtedly familiar with the virtual meeting tools available today. Are you using them? Seeing a human face gives us an additional layer of connectedness over a phone call or email. We get to see the person\u2019s eyes and get a glimpse of their environment. We can read tonality in their voice differently than without these visual cues. I\u2019ve recommended to my clients that have remote teams that they do a daily \u201cstand up\u201d check-in by video. Each morning, they do a quick group meeting to facilitate conversation and engagement as they discuss what they're working on, call out any roadblocks they\u2019re facing and focus on goals for the day. This keeps continuity in the team and ensures everyone feels supported. I\u2019ve heard of groups doing virtual coffee meetings, virtual happy hours and more. We can\u2019t forget the power of a smiling face, even if we can\u2019t physically be in the same room.\n\nFor virtual meetings, ensure your video presence represents your presence accurately. Will you take the video call from a bedroom, garage, kitchen table or home office? Check the background of your environment \u2014 not to sterilize and depersonalize it, but rather to ensure there is nothing inappropriate or distracting. One case I heard of involves a sales professional who began taking video calls with international clients and forgot to remove several pinup posters in the background. He was speaking with a very conservative client and the client was disturbed by the posters in the background. Another IT specialist did video calls with a client in a bikini top, as she was grounded at her beach house. These are simple steps you can take to ensure your visual reputation is intact.\n\nRelated: 9 Ways COVID-19 Is Like Running a Marathon\n\n2. Voice calls. Similarly, if given the option of an email or a phone call, try calling. It\u2019s likely the person you\u2019re attempting to reach is at home, maybe at their desk or managing their children\u2019s schoolwork (if they are suddenly home schooling). A phone call \u2014 even a short one \u2014 gives us human connection. Warmth, compassion and empathy can be communicated differently on a call than an email.\n\n3. Social media. The online space offers us a compelling place to gather, albeit not in person. The flow of information and insight is constant and global. While it will never replace in person human interaction, social media offers some unique ways we can leverage our strengths, help others and come together as a global community.\n\nRelated: When Your Business Runs Out of Your Home, How Do You Restore Work-Life Balance?\n\n4. Share your resources. Do you have skills, talents, experience or work you can share online? There\u2019s a mathematics professor in California offering to tutor college students online for free. A musician in Nashville offers free concerts to lift spirits and entertain. A neighbor posts an offer to run to the pharmacy for her neighbors. Personally, I reached out to former and current executive coaching clients offering free sessions if they need it to help them manage their businesses. Many of us are mentoring military veterans who are trying to transition to a civilian career in a completely chaotic civilian work sector.\n\nAs you share your resources, consider connecting your offer to your \u201cwhy\u201d \u2014 your values. Personal branding and reputation are anchored in values, and without them, offers are meaningless. The neighbor who says she\u2019ll run to the store for neighbors adds, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to help those who are at risk.\u201d The professor offering tutoring services adds, \u201cWithout learning, we are nothing as a society.\u201d And the musician who performs concerts on live-streamed platforms says, \u201cWe come together as a world through music. And I was gifted with the ability to help, so I am.\u201d Adding your value statement to your offer creates greater meaning, without depreciating the offer. Authenticity is key here \u2014 the value must be real and not opportunistic. Values, after all, are your moral operating system.\n\n5. Share your humanness. What are you feeling and experiencing? We all see the posts of individuals scared and lonely. We also images of empty (or fully stocked) shelves and the meanings those images are meant to imply. In all of the ways we share content online, we are sharing our humanness and insight into what we believe and value. Some people offer continuous posts of meaningful scripture to remind their followers that the Bible shows the way out of this situation. Others use humor and levity to help their online community release some stress and smile for a moment.\n\nHowever you share, remember that human beings are sharing human thoughts and emotions, and other humans are reading them. Consider how you\u2019ve presented yourself online in the past and whether it\u2019s appropriate and necessary for you to post more authentic, heartfelt messages at this time.\n\nFor example, a client of mine is a mental health specialist. She works with a specific population who regard her as strong, competent and knowledgeable. In the past, this reputation has empowered her to give hearty and meaningful advice meant to help her community navigate their unique circumstances. She\u2019s rarely shared her own feelings or fears. Today, as her small audience blends into the larger community of people struggling with broader mental health issues, she finds herself speaking differently. We\u2019ve broadened her messaging to ensure she\u2019s not professing academic advice and protocols, but rather is sharing her feelings and concerns, along with real recommendations for those listening. This step took a lot of faith for her to do: She was reluctant to speak about herself for fear it could dispel her credibility. In fact, as she has shared more, and pulled other colleagues into the conversation with her, she\u2019s found her clients and audiences grow and appreciate the trust she placed in them to share her story. Her personal brand stands on helping others. In these times, she is helping others by sharing her vulnerability and enlisting the support of others to grow strength in her community.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways to Find Opportunity in a Crisis\n\n6. Share carefully. I\u2019ve noticed several colleagues sharing inflammatory information, and while I have to believe their intent is good, the message can be harmful. In some cases, the information is later proved untrue. Or the information upsets followers who are trying to remain calm. Social media has become a news source and a respite from daily life (especially when we get a lens into the lives of famous people, access to concerts, museums, and other art forms we otherwise couldn\u2019t visit, and can hear from leaders who might otherwise stay quiet). Social media offers access to information and inspiration to help keep us grounded and proactive in our own response to current situations. Online posts that gaslight panic are not helpful, and it could be argued that when we find our new normal after the pandemic has resolved, reputations of those who stoked the flames of these fires could be negatively impacted, if they aren\u2019t already.\n\nYour reputation is about more than you\n\nWhat do you care about? If you are moved to action during this time, consider sharing your ideas online so others can be inspired to do the same, or can help you. Many people are struggling to find ways to support and help and protect others. If you have ideas, consider it your obligation to share those. From fostering shelter animals to donating blood to offering free coaching, how can you help? The goal is not to get gold stars for your efforts, but rather to inspire, influence and impact others to help as well. That is the greatest way to build reputational equity and help the world at the same time.

But that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Let me explain. Good names are usually only good in the rearview mirror. At the time they are created, they seem risky and sometimes dumb. Are Google and Apple inherently good names, or do they have the benefit of a rosy rear view? Probably the latter.\n\nTerrible timing has certainly contributed to a difficult start for the Jeffrey Katzenberg-founded mobile-video platform, which launched earlier this spring. Still, maybe it isn\u2019t just the timing. Maybe they made bad decisions. Maybe the product doesn\u2019t fit. A name should be judged based on how well it matches the company\u2019s criteria, not on public perception. Because, as mentioned, success shades how we perceive the company, not the strength of the name. Phil Rosenzweig calls this tendency to be biased by success The Halo Effect.\n\nRelated: Brad Flowers\u2019s The Naming Book is available now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound.\n\nA company that raises nearly $2 billion should plan for success. They certainly planned a naming strategy with that in mind. The criteria assumed rapid adoption in the U.S. and quick adoption abroad. Quibi is purpose-built for travel. It feels familiar in the UK with its close tie to the slangy quid. You can imagine the French embracing it as \"Kee-bee,\" similar to Quebec. It is at home in Arabic and Hindi. The alternating consonant/vowel, consonant/vowel construction is reminiscent of one of the most well-traveled brands, Coca-Cola.\n\nHowever, those positives aren\u2019t positive in the current light. If the naming strategy assumes rapid usage in the U.S. and that doesn\u2019t happen, the international flair puts up barriers to a skeptical stateside audience with more time on their hands than usual. The primary obstacle is unclear pronunciation.\n\nWe have all been in a bar and become interested in an exotic beer, only to order the IPA because we didn\u2019t know how to pronounce the other one. Same with a dish in a restaurant or an author in a bookstore. People, in general, don\u2019t like to look stupid, and few things make you feel as stupid as saying something incorrectly.\n\nThere are a couple of ambiguous points in Quibi. I mispronounced it before I heard someone say it. Rhyme is one of the factors that improve memorability in a word; maybe I was trying to force it into the name. Also, the decision to end the name in \"-i\" rather than \"-y\" makes the word look more French. I found myself saying \"Kee-bee\" as I was reading to myself. It feels more snappy, more energetic and in-line with quick snippets of content.\n\nThe second hangup is with the tagline. Currently, it reads: \u201cQuick bites. Big stories.\u201d That leads you to think the name is a blend of the words quick and bite. But, as the reader, you quickly reconsider this because pronouncing it \"Kwi-bye\" doesn\u2019t seem right. It doesn\u2019t feel or look right, and you are left a little confused. If you combine quick and big, you get closer to the right pronunciation, but quick and big aren\u2019t as meaningful as quick and bite.\n\nI will admit to Googling the name to figure out its pronunciation. There were several videos, which probably isn\u2019t a good sign. The name is intended to be pronounced like \"Quimby\" without the -m, which is the last point of confusion. With this pronunciation, you would expect the more standard English spelling of Quiby.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk's Boring Company Completes Excavation of Las Vegas Tunnels\n\nAll is not lost, though. Defying expectations can be a good thing. The result is memorability. The more you have to think about the name, the more likely you will be to recall it. If Quibi can overcome launching in a pandemic by providing users with great content, and assuming it can move quickly abroad, then I think we will all be looking back in 10 years thinking: \u201cDamn, Quibi is a really great name.\u201d If not, I am afraid it will end up with the Nova in the dustbin of misunderstood and misremembered names that we don\u2019t like because the product didn\u2019t live up to our expectations.", "author": ["Brad Flowers"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/Z2Ewz2gZtow/350256", "published": "2020-05-15T18:30:00", "title": "5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Rebound After a Crisis", "text": "May 15, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe current pandemic is dramatically impacting American small businesses and entrepreneurs.

However, many believe that, like other \u201cblack swan\u201d events, the COVID-19 pandemic will fuel the next wave of innovation and more resilient and world-changing startups than ever before.\n\nYet, with more than 22 million Americans filing for unemployment \u2014 a decade-long setback in job creation \u2014 and some Americans fleeing major cities, many new and established entrepreneurs are too terrified to even think about starting new companies. As much as those of us who have been through the wringer want to shout from the rooftops, \u201cHey, now is a perfect time to start a company!\u201d we understand that people are just not ready to hear that message.\n\nRelated: How One Franchise Company President Makes Better, Faster Decisions During Uncertain Times\n\nWe do know, however, that in order to truly revive the economy, we\u2019ll have to do it through entrepreneurship. But we\u2019re still potentially nine to twelve months away from that reality. Even businesses that are managing to weather this storm aren\u2019t thinking about growth right now; they\u2019re thinking about survival.\n\nStill, there are entrepreneurial steps you can take right now to put yourself in the best position possible for when the economy does come out of lockdown.\n\n1. Pay attention.\n\nCOVID-19 has shifted many consumer behaviors and business models in the short term, but we\u2019re also starting to get an idea of the long-term economic changes COVID-19 will leave in its wake. Many of these long-term changes will come in the form of digital disruption. Not only do recessions accelerate cost-saving changes in business models, but they also necessitate completely new business models to best serve the ensuing \u201cnew normal.\u201d\n\n2. Strengthen your core.\n\nThe wonderful thing about technology is that it allows us to do more with less. It also allows us to do more of what we\u2019re good at while automating and/or outsourcing the rest. Since COVID-19 has proven the benefits of remote work, it will naturally accelerate our evolution toward a knowledge and skills-based economy. In this model, entrepreneurs can access more outside expertise more quickly than ever before, and even on-demand.\n\nRelated: 3 Fundamentals for Building a Resilient Supply Chain\n\nHistorically, entrepreneurs have been hindered by wearing too many hats. The old belief was that, in order to cut costs and conserve resources, startups should do everything in-house. For many, this in-house model correlated with the old school prioritization of in-office collaboration \u2013 the idea that, in order to maximize trust, value and efficiency, you need \u201cbutts in seats.\u201d This belief persisted, even in the years leading up to COVID-19.\n\nYet many startups don\u2019t need many (if any) butts in seats, and some companies might never get up off the ground without remote, distributed work teams. Post-pandemic, it won\u2019t matter if you have all the necessary expertise on staff, as long as you have quick access to that expertise. And, as many businesses become more digitally complex, they\u2019ll need to rely more on remote talent from around the world.\n\nThis way of the future will free more creative visionaries to found world-changing businesses without necessarily having or even staffing niche technical expertise. Utilizing new platforms that provide quick, on-demand access to talent around the world, founders can focus on the core day-to-day functions that keep their business running.\n\n3. Adopt a millennial mindset.\n\nIn 2018, millennials already represented the largest generation in the U.S. workforce. Conditioned to work with digital tools like Zoom and Slack, \u201cGeneration Nice\u201d also embraces more compassionate . With up to 71% of millennials seeking a \u201csecond family\u201d at work, entrepreneurs who lead with empathy stand the best chance of maximizing their teams\u2019 potential.\n\nThis post-pandemic business world will prioritize human capital alongside advancing technology because millennials know that you cannot program creativity. Millennial leaders also recognize that, despite the Soylent-drinking Silicon Valley stereotype, millennials reject the old top-down mentality that professional success means working yourself to the bone while sacrificing your relationships with friends and family.\n\n4. Let work stem from life.\n\nMany who have been furloughed or shifted to remote work are spending more time with their families. And though many of us have been conditioned to view our personal lives as separate or even detracting from our professional success, true entrepreneurs know that some of our best creative ideas stem from our essential, everyday experiences.\n\nRelated: 8 Ways the Crisis Will Forever Change the Future Workforce\n\nAny entrepreneur who\u2019s taken a work break can attest to the way their mind and body literally detox. When you\u2019re out of the game, you have the opportunity to clear your mind and begin to operate on a more empathetic and understanding level. Learning how to access this more relaxed and benevolent mindset is absolutely key to successful entrepreneurship because it optimizes your ability to creatively solve problems.\n\n5. Learn how to recover.\n\nIf you\u2019re always responding to challenges with anxiety or aggression, people will be much less likely to pitch creative ideas to you. They\u2019ll be much less likely to pull you into spontaneous Zoom meetings to brainstorm if they don\u2019t think you\u2019re open to new, potentially disruptive ideas. Often, the only way to develop a more open and receptive leadership style is to pull yourself out of the fight and take time to relax and recover.\n\nUsing downtime to establish effective recovery strategies can help you rebound stronger in your next professional pursuit. Whether through meditation, exercise, or both, taking the time to recover in the way that best clears your head and leaves you feeling the most refreshed will pay dividends now and in the future, when you\u2019re back in the thick of work stress.\n\nLearning how to promote your own wellbeing will not only improve the health of your personal relationships \u2013 it will also deepen the connections you build with your colleagues. And when your core team feels respected and cared for, they\u2019ll work extra hard to take care of your customers, and your profits will take care of themselves.", "author": ["Danny Beckett Jr."]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/NJr8Edd7nzI/350637", "published": "2020-05-15T18:30:00", "title": "This Entrepreneur Started Her Business to Offer Meals to New York City Hospital Workers", "text": "May 15, 2020 2 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn early April, Stacy Rotner launched GratiFoodNYC, a grassroots initiative dedicated to sending gratitude through food. Rotner's first goal was to send meals to the frontline emergency and ICU department teams of doctors, nurses and staff at New York City hospitals.\n\nAfter sharing her idea on Facebook, Rotner received nearly $20,000 in one week through her GratiFoodNYC Venmo account. In under four weeks, Rotner had raised more than $65,000.\n\n\"Donations came from family, friends, colleagues and strangers from all over New York and around the country, and as far as Madrid and Tel Aviv,\" she told Jessica Abo over Zoom.

As we strode confidently into 2020, global stock markets where on highs \u2014 of course, around that same time, the World Health Organization became aware of a string of pneumonia-like illnesses in Wuhan. The rest, are fully, painfully, up to date on. The global economy is in paralysis, necessitating huge interventions by government and leading to significant job losses.\n\nEven the mighty Google is reportedly looking at ways to find efficiencies, cutting marketing budgets as well as initiating hiring freezes. Startups are also increasingly sharply in focus, with many that were previously flying high now in a fight for survival.\n\nRelated: Why Progressive Leaders Focus On Playing the Long-Game\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, 280 startups laid off 21,609 employees from March 11 to April 21. Eventbrite, the global ticketing and experience platform has announced a $100 million annualized expense reduction plan, reducing its global workforce by 45 percent together with other cost-saving measures. Coming only a short time after Amazon's potential investment in online delivery business Deliveroo being provisionally approved by the UK competition watchdog, reports emerged that Deliveroo is set to cut hundreds of employees, struggling with lower demand during the lockdown.\n\nAnother eye-catching story was StockX laying off 12 percent of its workforce. This should serves as a warning on how fast things can change; StockX was valued at $1 billion as of July 2019, and as recently as an March 27, the CEO of the \"stock market for things\" mentioned it had benefited from the events over the last few months. However, in a statement to Business Insider, StockX said it was now shifting from a \"growth-focused mentality to one rooted in operational efficiency.\" Clearly it is a time for all businesses to face into our new reality \u2014 things are changing quickly.\n\nWhat is operational efficiency?\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, the concept of operational efficiency probably didn\u2019t come up too often in your management team meetings pre-crisis. Operational efficiency measures the efficiency of profit earned as a function of operating costs; the greater the operational efficiency, the more profitable a company is, generating greater income or returns for the same, or lower costs. One example is lean manufacturing. Adapted from the Toyota Production System, it also refers to the concept of \"continuous improvement,\" a process that seeks to reduce and eventually eliminate inefficiency and waste.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Recognizing a Meaningful Business Opportunity When You See One\n\nOne of its key frameworks, 5S, is named after five activities derived from the Japanese words seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu and shitsuke \u2014 to sort, straighten (or \u2018set in order\u2019), shine, standardize and sustain. Interestingly some later adaptions of the model also call for a sixth \u2018S\u2019 for safety \u2014 but hopefully that\u2019s a given right now.\n\nWhen adapted, these principles can prove to be a useful starting point for startups to consider. Operational efficiency does not just need to be focused on reducing headcount \u2014 there are many practical areas to address declining revenues and profits and positives to derive as well.\n\n1. Review your core business functions\n\nIn 5S, the first step of \"sort\" typically refers to the need to remove all unneeded items, only retaining what is needed for efficient production. This reduces distraction and the time required to look for something, increasing the amount of available, useful space. Take this time to review your business activities end-to-end. Do you have areas that are not (yet) core to your business survival? Can they be paused for now?\n\n2. Realign resources to your core business\n\nConnected to the above, this is also an opportunity to realign and focus your team on the areas of greatest return for your business.\n\n3. Are you returning to the same scale of business?\n\nConsider your own \"space\" when things return to normal. Most of us reading this have been working with a distributed team for some time now, so do you still need all of your office space? Perhaps this new way of working can enable you to reduce your costs.\n\n4. Review your workflows\n\n\"Set in order\" in 5S refers to making workflow smoother through establishing specific locations, quantities and order of parts needed for efficient operation. Look at your internal process for completing different types of task with an efficiency focus. How they might be improved?\n\n5. Partner review\n\nDo you have multiple companies offering similar services to you or point solutions in different parts of your business? Single or integrated solution might enable you to reduce cost. Equally, consider if you still need enterprise scale solutions you selected for growth.\n\n6. Identify hidden areas of waste\n\nIt may be a while since you\u2019ve audited your business supply and procurement. Now is the time to look to reduce waste in your business (e.g. SaaS services you are subscribed too that you can do without or can reduce to the free for now).\n\n7. Finish off those projects\n\nIn 5S, shine or shining represents inspecting your workplace and tools on a regular basis in order to improve efficiency, safety and prevent errors and defects. Consider if this is a time to finally get onto refining things that you\u2019ve never finished as you intended, such as long overdue software enhancements or addressing that backlog of technical debt. This will also improve the robustness of your core product.\n\n8. Standardize processes and KPIs\n\nSeiketsu refers to implementing visual displays and controls to standardize processes to making them part of daily routine. Do you agree, manage and monitor your key principles of working currently? Are your team clear on their responsibilities? Use this time to establish stronger KPIs and targets for creating efficiencies in your company.\n\n9. Bring the team into the process\n\nShitsuke also translates to \"do without being told,\" and focuses on maintaining operational efficiency through continued training and total employee involvement. As a startup, you might already be working in an agile, self-organized manner, but take this as an opportunity to bring your team into the review process, explaining why this is important for survival.\n\n10. Training and skills improvement\n\nAs you reorganize, seek input from your team to identify improvements \u2013 ideally incentivize them for offering suggestions. Ask them how they would suggest you reduce costs and innovate without impacting customer experience.\n\nTempering your growth ambitions and implementing an authentic-feeling culture of continuous improvement is not going to happen overnight, but hopefully some of the ideas covered here will spark ideas to help you becoming a leaner business as we all recover from this period. Gaining improvements in productivity, customer value, team morale and employee engagement, as well appropriate cost reduction will ultimately improve your business agility and operating model and lead to greater profitability. Be transparent and seek input \u2013 you just might find some game-changing improvements.\n\nRelated: 5 Steps to Help Your Business Emerge Stronger From the Health Crisis", "author": ["Geraint Evans"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/UL9AiZbFvSE/350325", "published": "2020-05-15T16:15:00", "title": "10 Lessons Every Entrepreneur Should Learn About Their Business", "text": "May 15, 2020 7 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nI co-founded a company 10 years ago, and in that decade we've closed seven M&As, expanded our operations, dramatically increased revenue and forged strategic partnerships. But of course this journey had its fair share of highs and lows. Here are 10 things I've learned that I think can be helpful to any entrepreneur.\n\nRelated: How One Franchise Company President Makes Better, Faster Decisions During Uncertain Times\n\nKnow when to say no to a deal\n\nEarly on, an investor offered $25 million to acquire ironSource, even upping the bid to $40 million two months later. We turned the offer down. When you\u2019re in this position, it\u2019s critical to deeply question yourself and to be brutally honest. I certainly was. If your goal is to create something and then move on to your next challenge once your business grows beyond a certain point, then saying yes to a deal makes perfect sense. But if you believe in the long-term potential of your company and are someone who genuinely wants to see your vision through its different growth cycles, then don\u2019t be afraid to hang on. You\u2019ll be in for quite the ride.\n\nInorganic growth is unavoidable if you want to build a long-term business\n\nAt first, organic growth might seem like a viable long-term strategy, but relying on it alone simply doesn\u2019t cut it in today\u2019s fast-paced, competitive market. From very early on, we knew that the only way our company could grow and compete was to be aggressive about strategic M&As. Organic growth should be a fundamental building block of every company\u2019s trajectory, but it can't be the only element.\n\nRelated: 5 Things You Need to Know About Acquiring a Business\n\nBuy based on DNA, not (only) on numbers\n\nOur approach to acquisitions is largely shaped by the culture of the acquired or merged company, due to my belief that numbers don\u2019t tell the whole story. We look for a fundamental alignment of interests as well as a shared DNA. Focusing on acquiring companies that share our vision has meant that the executives from these deals have, in most cases, stayed on board. Consider looking beyond spreadsheets and into the culture of the team at the other company. If there\u2019s a common DNA that will strengthen your journey forward, then you\u2019re headed in the right direction.\n\nCreate a culture that enables radical trust\n\nI believe that trust \u2014 not just standard trust, but radical trust \u2014 is the best way to get the most out of talented employees and push your company forward. When I say radical trust, I mean letting your trusted employees run with their visions and exercise their strengths. It is something that we apply to all areas of our company. It has led us to many failed ventures, but more importantly, it has delivered products and concepts that have become essential to its core. Creating and maintaining a culture of radical trust ensures that each and every one of your team members feel empowered and have the confidence and resources they need to leverage their strengths in an environment that radically supports them.\n\nRelated: True Transparency Requires Sharing the Good and the Bad\n\nDon\u2019t wait for someone else to make the right decision\n\nContrary to popular belief, good things don\u2019t always come to those who wait. In 2017, we launched ironWeekend, an initiative that gives employees an extra day off over the weekend every quarter. The government in Israel, where we're based, had been considering legislating something like this for a while, but why wait for something you believe in? We rolled the concept out across all of our global offices, and three years later ironWeekend is still flourishing. Never wait for someone else to make the right decision for you.\n\nRelated: 7 Financial Lessons the Crisis Will Teach Us\n\nHave pointless conversations\n\nCommunication in genuine and unceremonious ways builds valuable and interesting connections. As important as it is to have actionable discussions that propel your company forward, it\u2019s equally as important to have interactions with no set goal. In a world where every second of every day is optimized, invest in building real human connections. Having pointless conversations with employees will help you get to know them on a personal basis, learn what drives them and discover their interests. Pointless conversations are somewhat of a rarity these days, but conversations are the building blocks of strong relationships.\n\nDaughters know best\n\nWhile traveling in the car with my daughter, I was on loudspeaker with a colleague who was putting pressure on me to go to an event that I was resisting attending. My daughter was paying attention (unbeknownst to me) and blurted out that the event sounded important to my colleague, and \u201cif you help him now, he\u2019ll help you out one day when you need something.\u201d Important lesson learned from my 8-year-old.\n\nIn negotiations, know your red line\n\nHuman nature is such that the more emotionally invested we get into something and the more time we dedicate to it, the further we\u2019ll go to get it and the harder it is to stick to our boundaries. If you\u2019re in negotiations without pre-setting limits with yourself then, guaranteed, you will end up crossing the line and be disappointed with yourself later on. No matter what you\u2019re negotiating, it\u2019s always important to remember where you need to draw the line. And it\u2019s equally as important to know your limits (but not to share it with others of course). Set boundaries, be disciplined and you\u2019ll be able to come out of most negotiations well.\n\nRelated: Top 10 Negotiation Tactics Used By Buyers (and How to Respond)\n\nIn times of crisis, be flexible\n\nAs the current situation has taught me, it\u2019s critical to be open-minded and flexible when the unknown hits you. Take internal mobility as an example. Although some roles in the company have technically disappeared or are experiencing a very reduced workload, I\u2019m working with my team to see how we can reallocate our manpower to teams who need extra support with those who aren\u2019t at full capacity. Not everyone will be a perfect match, but it allows us to retain our employees, which is massively important while we weather this storm. What\u2019s more, it creates an opportunity for someone to try and potentially excel in an area of the business they would otherwise never have exposure to.\n\nDon\u2019t take yourself too seriously\n\n...but do take your work very seriously. This is a deceptively simple formula that I try to live by, and that has trickled through ironSource to become a defining characteristic of our DNA. People who take themselves seriously are exhausting to be around. You spend time managing their ego as opposed to focusing on what really matters or what\u2019s most interesting. And people who don\u2019t take their work seriously are ultimately people who aren\u2019t striving for excellence, aren\u2019t focused on looking at the bigger picture and aren't thinking about how to do better tomorrow.\n\nRelated: Master These 15 Habits to Be Taken More Seriously at Work", "author": ["Tomer Bar-Zeev"]}]}, "entrepreneur_marketing": {"rss": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/marketing", "articles": [{"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/-LnqDpTYbmg/348139", "published": "2020-05-15T15:30:00", "title": "The 17 Best Content Marketing Books You Can Read Right Now", "text": "May 15, 2020 8 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAre you looking to up your content marketing game right now? Are you tired of seeing the same on everyone\u2019s \u201cbest of\u201d list? Me too.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, those books are good, and some are even classics, but content marketing is always evolving. You must keep up with what\u2019s new and exciting in the field so you can apply it to your business, no matter how big or small you are.\n\nSo, I decided to take a deep dive into the newer content marketing books that have been released in the last couple of years. I\u2019ve gathered the best 17 books on content marketing that\u2019ll help you be a better marketer, strategies, and business owner.\n\n1. Content Marketing by Gavin Turner\n\nTurner\u2019s book is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your business with proven strategies that\u2019ll help grow your brand and business. It\u2019s filled with useful tactics you can use in both the short-and long-term to ramp up your marketing, boost content recognition and production and how to tie it all together.\n\n2. Dreyer\u2019s English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style by Benjamin Dreyer\n\nA fresh alternative to the dull grammar and writing books out there, Dreyer\u2019s English was written by a long-time copy chief at Random House Publishing. It\u2019s an engaging and fun look at words and grammar that anyone will appreciate, no matter if you\u2019re new or a veteran marketer. Use it to answer your questions about when to use a semicolon or em dash and why it\u2019s okay to start a sentence with \u201cAnd\u201d or \u201cBut.\u201d\n\n3. F#ck Content Marketing: Focus on Content Experience to Drive Demand, Revenue & Relationships by Randy Frisch\n\nOnce you get past the title, this book is an excellent resource for content marketers. Frisch, the CMO and co-founder of Uberflip, wrote it to help marketers focus more on the way content is experienced, rather than simply pumping it out. His main idea is that marketers have worried too much about content production and not enough about content scalability. It\u2019s an interesting read and one that can help marketers surface their content in the never-ending chronological scroll that is our online world today.\n\n4. Marketing Rebellion: The Most Human Company Wins by Mark Schaefer\n\nSchaefer wrote this book because he knows that the marketing landscape has changed dramatically. Consumers have so many ways of avoiding ads on TV, their browsers, and social media streams that marketers have no choice but to change their tactics. In the book, Schaefer advocates that marketers take a more effective and human approach to their messages. He explains it all clearly and outlines actionable steps that all marketers can take to move forward.\n\n5. Mean People Suck: How Empathy Leads to Bigger Profits and a Better Life by Michael Brenner\n\nThis book was published at a time when interest in the customer experience is more critical than ever, and job dissatisfaction is at an all-time high. Negativity can seep into any business from anywhere, so Brenner explains the benefits of empathy at work, and how it can help people be better outside the office too. Brenner\u2019s filled the book with stories of companies that were able to replace toxic cultures and dissatisfied customers with helpful, positive employees that delivered high-quality customer experiences.\n\n6. Superfans: The Easy Way to Stand Out, Grow Your Tribe, and Build a Successful Business by Pat Flynn\n\nFlynn wrote this book to help entrepreneurs build a more engaged, loyal audience, and explains why a smaller, more loyal audience is better. Superfans makes the case that we should be thinking more about connecting with our audiences on a deeper level through extra-special moments that \u201ccreate novelty, defy expectations, and break the mold.\u201d\n\n7. Talk Triggers by Jay Baer and Daniel Lemin\n\nBaer and Lemin do an excellent job of writing about an often overlooked aspect of content marketing in this book \u2014 word of mouth marketing. Most marketers don\u2019t have a strategy for this particular marketing channel, so they created one. Their \u201c4-5-6\u201d learning system will help you uncover and activate talk triggers in your business. They\u2019re such good writers that this well-organized book explains a complex topic without being overwhelming.\n\n8. They Ask, You Answer by Marcus Sheridan\n\nSheridan\u2019s popular book got an update last year, with new sections on closing deals with video marketing and the essential elements every good business website should have. He also included new stories of businesses who\u2019ve used these tactics to great success, lending even more proof to the fact that this strategy works for everyone.\n\n9. Conversational Marketing by Dave Gerhardt and David Cancel\n\nDrift co-founders Cancel and Gerhardt wrote this book as the definitive book on how to generate better leads and close more sales with chatbots. Conversational Marketing explains how chatbots are transforming the way brands market themselves and interact with customers. It\u2019s a well-written and digestible primer on how to convert a business from traditional communication channels to the modern messaging apps we all use today.\n\n10. Killing Marketing: How Innovative Businesses Are Turning Marketing Cost Into Profit by Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose\n\nIn this follow-up book to an earlier classic, Pulizzi and Rose explain how today\u2019s innovative companies are achieving remarkable results by fundamentally changing their approach. They\u2019ve dramatically increased customer loyalty and revenue by creating more value for customers by using owned media and changing to a customer-centric way of thinking about content.

But creating a second act for your business journey will help you prepare for the inevitable, while creating a stream of income your business desperately needs.\n\nEntrepreneurs must fulfill the needs and emotions of their audience in different ways than before. Business owners need to be sensitive to the current situation in order to provide necessary value and an engaged response from customers.\n\nHere are four suggestions for entrepreneurs to creating a pivot strategy during the current crisis:\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Pivot Your Business During a Crisis\n\n1. Create a digital offering that fits consumers\u2019 needs and emotions now\n\nIf you are a service-based business or if you work off of retainers from your clients, creating a new service that aligns with the feelings of your clients is something that will set you apart from others who are continuing traditional efforts. Analyzing the current mental state of the client will help you customize your offer to something that will sell and help fulfill the need for what your client wants.\n\nOffering something such as one-on-one strategy calls and new ways for clients to tackle the current situations with their will provide more clarity to the entrepreneur as an individual. This clarity can then help them build a more reliable brand.\n\n2. Increase content and create more on digital media platforms\n\nSocial media usage has shown a massive spike in numbers when it comes to users utilizing newer and current platforms during this pandemic. The creation of content on platforms is critical for Entrepreneurs because it gives them the opportunity to showcase thought leadership.\n\nIn addition to the content on social media, creating content utilizing digital media platforms such as podcasts, YouTube videos, and even Tik Tok can communicate necessary value to new and current consumers. The latest platform, Tik Tok, has over 500 million users worldwide, and creating visually appealing content can help create a funnel for entrepreneurs to gain new customers. Using these platforms as a marketing tool while providing value and staying authentic will attract more eyes to the brand.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy\n\n3. Create online digital experiences that replicate in-person emotions\n\nWhile most, if not all, business events have been canceled, the first step of is rescheduling events and keeping the in-person event ideas alive for when it is safe to have them. However, in the meantime, creating the digital event, roundtable, or conference as if everyone was actually in-person can assist in driving conversations of business development and defining the next steps in an entrepreneur's journey. Platforms like hopin.to and bluejeans.com create great in-person vibes for events, conferences, and intimate workshops as well that work towards creating an engaging experience.\n\n4. Build new relationships that can foster new monetary partnerships\n\nA brand or business's relevance through awareness during this time of crisis is significant because maintaining a relationship with your consumers will drive genuine conversations that can turn into partnerships and potentially sponsorships that give more value to your audience.\n\nDirect messages, one-on-one zoom calls, and think tanks are great ways to start conversations. Simply saying \"how can I help you?\" can lead to a new business partnership.\n\nUltimately business is an odyssey, so when the current crisis is over, having an exit strategy that moves you forward is essential. Even if it's just going back to the same business model as before.\n\nLikewise, strengthening new and existing relationships is vital, because on the other side of this, consumers and partners are going to remember who was there for them.\n\nRelated: How to Become a Brand, Not an Employee", "author": ["Andrew Nguyen"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/H9Btak43CC8/350643", "published": "2020-05-14T19:15:00", "title": "Free Webinar | May 27: How to Increase Sales and Find New Customers While Working From Home", "text": "May 14, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way we do forever.

From DIY home improvement to street fashion, there\u2019s a blog for every topic you could ever dream of. If you\u2019ve got an idea, there are people out there willing to read about it! As the world adjusts to the new normal of social distancing and WFH, many will turn to bloggers as a source of entertainment and inspiration. So this begs the question: how does your businesses\u2019 blog stand out? Unfortunately, the answer is not simply to publish good articles \u2013 that\u2019s true, but not enough. We live in the age of information overload; for every question, there\u2019s bound to be five people with an answer. Crafting blog posts that will gather the attention of viewers and draw more traffic is going to require a bit more work. But don\u2019t be afraid! It won\u2019t involve staring for hours at your laptop screen in your pajamas (or your WFH quarantine outfit of the day). To enhance your blogs, it\u2019s going to require some added thought beyond posting, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to adopt the life of a full-time influencer. As you implement techniques to enhance traffic, you\u2019ll find they do a lot of the work for you \u2013 meaning less time on your part. I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favorite pro tips and ideas from other experienced bloggers to help you propel your blog above the rest. Grab your cup of Dalgona coffee, sit back, and let\u2019s talk blogs!\n\n1. Re-evaluate your niche\n\nRemember when I said there\u2019s an audience for every topic? It\u2019s still true, but the popularity of (or lack of) your topic can actually hurt your blog traffic. To explain, let\u2019s quickly visit your childhood and the story of Goldilocks and the three bears; the porridge was either too hot, too cold, or just right. Just like the porridge, your topic has to be just right in terms of the size of its audience. Choose a topic too large and you may have a difficult time standing out. If you choose one too specific, you could have a difficult time attracting a following. So here\u2019s my advice: if your audience isn\u2019t as large or reachable as you\u2019d like, reconsider your blog\u2019s focus, and adjust it\u2019s specificity accordingly.\n\nRelated: Get One-on-One Expert Help From Entrepreneur NEXT powered by Assemble\n\n2. Adjust posting frequency\n\nMuch like posting on social media, determining your post frequency for your blog is just as crucial. Post too much and your viewers may feel overwhelmed; post too little and they may forget about your blog altogether. There is no universally correct amount of posts that will drive your traffic up \u2013 as fantastic as that would be. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to suddenly churn out five blogs a week! Start slowly, adding an extra post, or even experimenting with one less post. Watch closely how your traffic reacts, and you\u2019ll slowly determine the frequency that will bring in a steady stream of viewers!\n\n3. Feature your most popular posts\n\nMost blog platforms will have a feature that allows users to showcase their most popular posts on the main page; my advice is to use this to your advantage. By showing off some of your most successful posts, this will impress any viewer first arriving at your page, and increase the likelihood that they\u2019ll visit your other posts, as well. Take some time to look through your past blogs and notice which ones received the most engagement and views. By showing off these specific posts, visitors to your blog site will be more likely to return to see similar content!\n\nRelated: How to Start a Blog and Make Money Online\n\n4. Post about your blog\n\nSometimes less is more, but not in this case. Promoting your blog shouldn\u2019t stop once it\u2019s published. Now is the time to tap into your influencer side, and post, post, post! I\u2019ve worked with blog sites at a variety of companies, and if I\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s that promoting blogs on social media is a surefire way to increase traffic. Provide clickable links to your latest blogs on Facebook and Twitter, and post the website link to your blog in your Instagram bio. Increasing the visibility of your blogs across social media will surely benefit your blog traffic, and demonstrate to your followers that you have more to offer outside of these platforms.\n\n5. Add keywords\n\nHave you heard of SEO? If not, let\u2019s take a quick crash course. SEO means \u201cSearch Engine Optimization\u201d, or optimizing your content so that it ranks higher in search results. One of the easiest ways to dip your toes into SEO is by adding keywords to your content that are currently popular in your niche. For example, if I wanted to write a blog about pop culture, I\u2019d sprinkle in keywords such as \u201cGigi Hadid\u201d, \u201cCharli D\u2019Amelio\u201d, or \u201cTiger King\u201d (all currently trending topics in the celebrity realm). Adding keywords will increase your blog\u2019s chances of becoming more visible in searches on the web, therefore bringing more traffic to your site!\n\nRelated: How to Write a Book (and Actually Finish It) in 5 Steps\n\n6. Follow related blogs for inspiration\n\nThe good news is, you\u2019re not alone. Where there\u2019s one blog about an industry, there\u2019s bound to be plenty more, and that\u2019s not always a bad thing! In fact, there\u2019s no better inspiration than existing content from other businesses and leaders related to your topic. If you\u2019re feeling stuck, or even need somewhere to simply begin your blog, look to others for inspiration. Connect with them. Learn how they became successful with blogging and mold their success tips into creating your own popular blog site. And stay connected! I can guarantee, after years of experience in blogs, there are still moments of feeling stuck despite having a good amount of experience under my belt. When these times come, I turn to the blogs of other established people within the industry. Soon enough, the creative juices flow once again, and they will for you, too.\n\n7. Guest blog posts\n\nHere\u2019s a tip that will give your tired fingers a rest from typing: invite someone else to write a blog on your site. I don\u2019t mean someone random that you meet on the street (but who am I to judge your strategy?), rather someone who is within your industry. In #6, I spoke about how there are many blogs for almost every topic- which means there is also a good bunch of people who are like-minded to you. Tap into this network. Although partnering with your competition can be an intimidating idea, there\u2019s no need to be afraid. Guest blogging can be a friendly way to help one another gain new blog traffic, and introduce your brand\u2019s content to an entirely new audience. By hosting another industry professional\u2019s content on your site, you\u2019ll be able to offer a fresh perspective for your readers \u2013 and keep them coming back for more.\n\nCreating and maintaining a successful blog is no easy feat, and certainly isn\u2019t accomplished overnight. But don\u2019t let those initial feelings overwhelm you; it does get easier over time with a little practice and fine-tuning. Take the time to determine the best plan for your blog, and stick to it as much as possible.

Here's How to Get Started.", "text": "May 13, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nEveryone \u201cknows\u201d that sponsoring podcasts is, quite often, one of the most effective and easiest ways to launch a modern startup and set it on a fast-growth trajectory. Although podcast audience numbers are down slightly during the pandemic, most industry observers predict they will bounce back up once the stay-at-home orders are rescinded and commutes resume.\n\nPodcasting is especially attractive for advertisers, since it enables distribution of content when the audiences want it, wherever they want it and in whatever platform they choose to consume it.\n\nWhen plans are laid to launch a modern campaign, spending money on podcasts is almost certainly going to be strongly considered. According to Triton Digital, a provider of technology for the podcast industry, there are more than 800,000 active podcasts available, with 54 million episodes.\n\nTaking those first few steps in this process can be simple: First, determine the audience profile that makes up your target market. Basic information to include their age range, gender, education, occupation, income level, family situation, geographic location, politics, hobbies and interests, etc. Then, identify the podcast distribution networks that represent which shows reach your target market, and work with those companies' sales personnel to help figure out which specific shows reach the best audience profile within the desired spend or budget.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons to Add a Podcast to Your Content-Marketing Strategy\n\nVerifying the legitimacy of a podcast is crucial. Have they worked with other well-known advertisers? Do they have known/legit guests, hosts, and/or a legit media brand associated with them?\n\nAccording to Lex Friedman, CRO of Art19, a California-based independently owned podcast company, there are three common mistakes entrepreneurs make with podcast campaigns:\n\nThe first is trying to make a podcast ad sound like a radio ad. \u201cRadio listeners instinctively hit the preset station button to avoid listening to ads. In fact, one of the reasons audiences continue to abandon radio for podcasts is to avoid the endless personal injury lawyer pitches and car dealership owners yelling at them,\u201d says Friedman.\n\nThe second is sponsoring a podcast mainly based on the fact that the decision-maker likes the show, without spending the time and effort to determine whether the show\u2019s audience profile is right for the brand and product. \u201cThe audience profile and your target market may overlap, but not closely enough, or you may just want to support some of your favorite podcasts,\u201d says Friedman.\n\nThe last mistake is being too cautious with your budget. Despite its widespread growth, podcasting remains one of the best options for entrepreneurs with shoe-string budget DIY campaigns, but Friedman says, \u201cDon\u2019t try to \u2018dip a toe\u2019 in podcast advertising and expect to get any results ... or even learn anything useful. If you only have a minimal amount \u2014 a few thousand dollars to invest \u2014 better to wait until you\u2019re able to properly fund a campaign.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey of 168,500 podcast listeners, the podcast advertising network Midroll found that \u201ccampaigns with ads on five or more episodes result in 39 percent more listener recall than those with just one spot. Running spots on just four episodes improves unaided brand recall by 27 percent compared to running a single ad.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Promote Your New Podcast: 10 Effective Strategies to Try\n\nSpeaking of spend, podcast ad deals \u201care not that complicated,\u201d says Richard Laermer, CEO of RLM PR. \u201cThere are two fundamental numbers always to consider: the first is the audience number, which gets measured as downloads, the higher the podcast's audience, the more an advertiser pays) The second number is CPM.\u201d CPM stands for cost per 1,000, M being the Roman numeral for 1,000. For podcasts, the 1,000 refers to downloads. When a podcast and an advertiser broker an ad deal, CPM is the number they negotiate. According to Laermer, \u201cgenerally, CPMs range from $25 to $40, and sometimes higher if the podcast is really hot or hits a niche audience.\u201d\n\nAccording to Midroll, 63% of podcast listeners have bought a product they heard advertised on a podcast. Whether the topic is daily news or sports, true-crime, career-booster professional development or obscure historical events, podcasts have become a part of our daily routines, making commutes easier and life more interesting, and represent a prime opportunity to change the way consumers respond to advertising in general.", "author": ["Dave Hochman"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/z7DBnH6vfPU/349942", "published": "2020-05-11T18:00:00", "title": "4 Questions You Should Ask Before Investing in Influencer Marketing", "text": "May 11, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nInfluencer marketing is alive and well. It\u2019s thriving, in fact. According to Mediakix, \"89 percent of marketers have reported that ROI from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels\" they invest in.\n\nStill, I\u2019ll admit, when influencer marketing first became a thing, I wasn\u2019t sure if the trend would last as long as it has. But I\u2019ve been happily proven wrong again and again, as it continues to be a worthwhile channel to invest in for brands of all sizes.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t learned whether influencer marketing can help you connect with new customers, drive sales and grow your business, now is the perfect time to find out. There are now more resources, tools and case studies available than ever before that can teach you everything you need to know to build a successful campaign.\n\nAfter spending part of the year talking with and learning from successful marketers about how to get the most out of working with influencers, I\u2019ve come to believe that there are four main questions every marketer should ask before getting too far along in the process. Those questions are as follows....\n\nRelated: Influencer Marketing Really Is a Game-Changer\n\n1. How well do I really know my customers?\n\nBefore investing in any new marketing channel, it\u2019s important that you take a step back and think about who your customers are and what matters to them. Knowing your customers and their motivations will help you throughout the development of your campaign \u2014 everything from deciding which platform to focus on and which influencer to hire to what kind of content to create and promote.\n\nThere are a lot of different exercises you can go through to put yourself in the shoes of your customers, but one of my favorites is known as empathy mapping. The purpose of an empathy map is to try to better understand what your customers think, how they feel, what they say and what actions they take. It\u2019s similar to a customer persona, but the creation process is often quicker and more collaborative. When you build an empathy map, you can choose who you want to gain insights from. It could be your marketing employees, some of your best and most loyal customers, other employees across other departments at your company or a blended group comprised of all three groups.\n\nBy the end of the process, you should have a better understanding of who your customers are, what their goals are and what they are motivated by.\n\nTo plan your first empathy map exercise, use this helpful step-by-step toolkit from IBM.\n\n2. What message am I trying to send?\n\nYou can hire the most popular influencer in the world, but your efforts are going to be fruitless unless you have a firm grasp on the specific message you\u2019re ultimately trying to send to your audience. Remember: You\u2019re not hiring influencers to sell for you \u2014 at least not directly. Instead, you\u2019re partnering with them to help you build relationships and establish trust with people. To do that, you need to have a clear idea of the message you\u2019re trying to get through to people.\n\nFor example, when Sprint launched a marketing campaign that leveraged influencers, they didn\u2019t make the message all about phones and phone service. Why? Because it\u2019s a message that ultimately won\u2019t resonate with people. Instead of focusing on themselves, Sprint worked with influencers to create a viral video that helped promote their #LiveUnlimited hashtag, which encourages people to follow their dreams and work hard for what they want.\n\nThink about what message you want to send to your customers. What matters to your customers, and what beliefs or motivations could you tap into with the help of the right influencers?\n\n3. What kind of person do I want to partner with?\n\nOne of the hardest truths to understand when you\u2019re new to influencer marketing is that not all influencers are created equal. This was one of the most common pieces of advice I got when talking with more than a dozen experienced marketers who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring influencers to help promote products and brands. Everyone said the same thing: You have to really know who you\u2019re working with and how they can help you.\n\nThings aren\u2019t always what they seem. Influencers can buy fake followers and make themselves appear bigger and more popular than they really are. Some social sites are working to crack down on the problem, but it hasn\u2019t been completely solved yet. You can waste a lot of money hiring people that won\u2019t actually be able to bring any sort of value or ROI back to your business.\n\nThe best way to avoid this is to think of influencers as business partners, not simply people you pay to promote products. A partner will ask questions, seek to understand your customers and your goals and help you develop a campaign that hits the mark. If you reach out to an influencer and all they care about is getting paid, it\u2019s probably worth finding someone else to work with.\n\n4. What will success look like for me?\n\nInfluencer marketing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It\u2019s not the golden goose that will lead to an instantaneous influx in sales as soon as you hit go on your campaign. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to think about how else you can track success along the way. You should know before launching a campaign how you\u2019ll measure success. If it\u2019s not immediate and direct sales, what does success look like for you? Maybe it\u2019s related to increases in engagement or website traffic. Maybe it\u2019s a boost in followers. Maybe all you want is to align yourself with a well-known person in your industry that you know your prospective customers like and trust.\n\nRelated: 4 Influencer-Marketing Secrets Entrepreneurs Need to Know\n\nThinking about the bigger picture and all the ways you can measure success will prevent you from getting too discouraged or giving up before you find out what kind of impact influencer marketing can have on your business.", "author": ["William Harris"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/mYaKRAWBCUI/349535", "published": "2020-05-10T20:30:00", "title": "Best Practices for Marketing During and After COVID-19", "text": "May 10, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nA global crisis can either paralyze a marketing team or galvanize it to thrive. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing: some companies are cutting back on marketing (in some instances, laying off the entire marketing team), while others are being more agile and coming up with interesting ways of engaging their audience during these difficult times.\n\nIf you want to stay in business, you can\u2019t stay idle for long. As a business owner myself, I understand why many entrepreneurs would want to cut down completely on marketing activities. Being conservative feels like the safe choice when there\u2019s uncertainly about how long the crisis will last. But we have to balance financial responsibility with the need to keep consumers informed and engaged when things get tough.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy\n\nIn fact, long-term studies show that the right approach during economic uncertainty is to increase \u2014 not decrease \u2014 your marketing spend. The last thing you want is to be caught flat-footed and find yourself lagging your competitors when the economy revs up again.\n\nFor the most part, consumers are receptive to some marketing at this time. A recent study from the American Association of Advertising Agencies found that 43% of consumers find it reassuring to hear from brands. In addition, 56% said they like learning how brands are helping their communities during the pandemic. Only 15% said they\u2019d rather not hear from companies.\n\nThat said, marketing during these times requires sensitivity to what\u2019s going on in people\u2019s lives and the flexibility to keep up with swift and swooping changes.\n\nStart with customer empathy\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on consumer behaviors and attitudes cannot be understated. An ongoing study we\u2019re conducting with our sister company Reach3 Insights recently found that 76% have recently picked up new habits, behaviors and routines in the wake of COVID-19. Of those people, 89% said they plan on keeping some of their new habits. Consumers are also trying new products, with 36% planning to continue using new brands they\u2019ve tried after COVID-19.\n\nNow is not the time to rely on assumptions. Any data you have from 6 weeks ago\u2014let alone 6 months ago\u2014is already out of date. As the consulting firm Gartner recently advised, CMOs must be proactive in monitoring changes to customer behaviors and purchasing needs while the crisis is unfolding.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips for Marketing a Service Business\n\nBusinesses must move forward but do so with genuine empathy. Marketers can help C-suite executives take the right action by acting as a lighthouse for consumer understanding. Many companies already have existing Voice of Customer and research programs\u2014these can be leveraged at this time to uncover the emotions underlying people\u2019s shifting attitudes and behaviors. Doubling down on customer engagement and listening programs can help provide insights on how to best move forward.\n\nTell relevant, authentic stories \u2014 and give, give, give\n\nImpressively, some brands have already produced compelling campaigns that speak to the realities of the pandemic. Dove, for example, created a spot shining a light on the courage of health care workers. Some brands, like Budweiser and Burger King, are focusing on social distancing and encouraging people to do their part by staying home. One of my favorites is Sam\u2019s Club, which recently created a 60-second spot thanking its employees and calling them \u201cretail heroes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great to see creativity in storytelling at this time, but marketers must push their companies to do even more. This is the time to pay it forward and provide as much value as possible to your customers and communities.\n\nEvery organization and person has the capacity to contribute in their own way. The most important question companies should ask themselves is this: \u201cwhat can I do to help?\u201d\n\nGiving back can take several forms. For instance, J\u00e4germeister is hosting a virtual event to help raise funds for New York restaurant owners. In tech, companies like Apple quickly mobilized their resources to produce much-needed PPEs. In my home country of Canada, big-box retailers such as Loblaw and Save-on-Foods have increased the wages of their front-line staff to show appreciation for their efforts. Following the lead of many software companies, Nike has temporarily eliminated its subscription fees for its app to help people stay fit while quarantining.\n\nThese moves transcend marketing and may not increase sales immediately, but they\u2019ll build goodwill and help drive long-term loyalty. Giving back is simply the right thing to do. The faster the world can beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the better chance all companies have in surviving the crisis.\n\nBe agile for the new normal\n\nSome entrepreneurs and marketers are holding off action, thinking that things will be back to \u201cnormal\u201d in a few weeks or months. I do not hold the same view.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Solopreneurs Can Strengthen Their Businesses Through Marketing\n\nFor one, some scientists are predicting that some form of social distancing may need to happen until 2022. That\u2019s a long time to put any type of marketing on hold. A more important consideration is the fact that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on the psyche and outlook of consumers. In our own COVID-19 study, 86% of Americans and 81% of Canadians agreed that the crisis will create a new normal and have a lasting impact on society.\n\nRegardless of how long the crisis actually lasts, COVID-19 will forever change the consumer landscape. After this comes to pass, companies can\u2019t go back to their old playbooks. Personas, messaging and even your product strategy may need to significantly evolve for the realities of the post-COVID-19 world.\n\nFor various reasons, some CMOs are hesitant to engage consumers in research at this time. But as Gartner\u2019s Frances Russell points out in a recent article, many marketers who have deployed surveys specifically about COVID-19's impact on customer experience have seen actionable responses. We see this in our own research as well: Not only are people answering our conversational chat surveys, they are also providing detailed selfie videos, which is really helping us and our clients and partners understand the human impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe bottom line is that fresh data and accurate insights have never been more important. In these uncharted territories, relying on instincts alone is dangerous. If you haven\u2019t reached out to your customers in the past month, now\u2019s the time to do so.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to recognize the uncertainties and fears surrounding COVID-19, don\u2019t let this crisis paralyze you. Enabling your team to really understand your customers and act based on timely insights is key to navigating your way through this crisis both for your marketing team and your company.", "author": ["Andrew Reid"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/bt2wXjB2Y7Y/349386", "published": "2020-05-08T15:50:00", "title": "How to Build an Online Community of Like-Minded Entrepreneurs", "text": "May 8, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nOnline communities are the way of the future: They bring people of all ages, backgrounds and hometowns together over a common industry, skill set or interest. I\u2019ve personally been stunned by the impact of an online community from my own experience. My online Facebook community, Elites Mastermind, has over 85,000 members who unite on a daily basis to discuss ecommerce tips and strategies.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Building an Online Community for Your Business\n\nThe impacts are significant. I created my Facebook group to build a virtual community and offer tips, but there are also sales advantages: The University of Michigan found that customers spend 19 percent more after joining a company\u2019s online community. Thanks to this, and the massive potential for consistent engagement, 74 percent of large companies have created online communities, according to research from Demand Metric. For me, however, it\u2019s about amplifying impact. I believe that anyone who has something to say can create an online community of like-minded entrepreneurs and unite them over a common cause. Here\u2019s how to do so, based on my own experience of what works.\n\n1. Share knowledge for free.\n\nThe core element of our group is sharing information at no cost. These tips cover Shopify, Facebook ads, social media marketing, product sourcing, traffic generation and more. Think about the commonalities among all the members of your group. What are individuals joining the community to learn? What interests them most? What are they hoping to accomplish? From there, create the content you know they want to know. Seventy-three percent of consumers report that they trust a brand when they deliver good quality products and services, according to research by Edelman. This extends beyond what you sell as a brand into what you give the consumer consistently. Quality advice, how-to\u2019s and pieces of value within your community develop trust.\n\nPart of this comes down to defining your niche. Generic entrepreneurship communities can work in theory, but they need strong branding and a strong sense of community to bring all of the individuals together. What aspect of entrepreneurship do you want to unite based on?\n\nRelated: 5 Examples Your Brand Can Follow to Build an Online Community\n\n2. Rely on word of mouth.\n\nI\u2019m often asked if I used paid ads to grow my Facebook community, but the honest answer is that all of it was word-of-mouth marketing. This, too, comes back to sharing value. Think about it: If you were part of a community that was sharing endless value, wouldn\u2019t you share it with a friend? At the very least it might come up in a conversation on business strategies, or you may quote the community in a podcast, article or blog post. Ultimately, this word-of-mouth marketing is stronger for your brand than paid ads, because 92 percent of consumers say they trust recommendations from friends and family over any type of advertising, according to Nielsen research. Give your community members something to rave about to their own communities.\n\nWhen just getting started, don\u2019t deny the power of your own word of mouth marketing. You\u2019ve likely established some trust with a few social media followers, friends or family members. Tell them what your community seeks to do and what you\u2019ll share \u2014 this will get the first batch of members in the door.\n\nRelated: 7 Strategies for Achieving Phenomenal Online Community Growth\n\n3. Engage frequently.\n\nCommunities aren\u2019t worth doing if they aren\u2019t supported consistently. Engage frequently \u2014 if not daily, every other day \u2014 because you will become the heartbeat that keeps the community going. Go into your group for a live video, host an \u201cask me anything,\u201d or even facilitate in-person events to build a sense of community. As membership grows and many start posting on their own, more activity will build. But stepping out and letting the members run the show can convey that you don\u2019t care. You also will miss out on a massive opportunity to establish thought leadership within your community.\n\nIt comes down to empowerment, too. Engagement encourages more participation. Every like and comment on a post makes the poster feel that they should share more.\n\nRelated: How to Create Community Among Your Customers\n\n4. Share in other groups as well.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to think of community as something that extends beyond the walls of your Facebook group. I consistently show up in other Facebook groups to share value, because a key part of community building is building relationships outside of the community you already have. The way I see it, everyone benefits: Those who I connect with can then join my community and share their unique perspective and expertise with the group. This is how grow continually and deliver value consistently.\n\nRelated: 3 Ways to Build an Online Community That's All About Your Prospects", "author": ["Steve Tan"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/PQHMZ3x1VlI/349667", "published": "2020-05-07T17:30:00", "title": "4 Ways Solopreneurs Can Strengthen Their Businesses", "text": "May 7, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nBusiness is hurting across the globe. Supply chains have been disrupted. People are staying home. Many businesses that rely on traditional sources of revenue are not able to stay open. For solopreneurs, the pain can be even more acute.\n\nRecessions traditionally impact small businesses disproportionately, as we saw in 2008, when they accounted for 45 percent of employment but 62 percent of jobs lost. And it\u2019s even worse for businesses with under 10 employees or young businesses period. Solopreneurs almost always fall into one of these categories and often both. And this current downturn seems to be following a similar trend, with nearly 80 percent of small businesses negatively impacted. Fifty-four percent have dealt with slower . No matter your sector, you\u2019re probably going to be dealing with fallout, but there is hope, and there are ways that solopreneurs can still thrive.\n\nCut your marketing back as little as possible \u2014 grow it if you can\n\nWhen a recession hits and money gets tight, many companies decide to cut back wherever they can. Marketing and advertising tend to get hit hard. But did you realize that you might actually be hurting yourself long-term by cutting back your spend?\n\nAs Moz founder Rand Fishkin notes, \u201cDon\u2019t use a sledgehammer, use a scalpel.\u201d Businesses that lower ad spend during a recession tend to see sales fall 20 to 30 percent over the next two years.\n\nMarketing and advertising are the low-hanging fruit if you\u2019re going to tighten your belt, but do it with the mindset of pruning for new growth, not that of a drowning man clinging to a life preserver.\n\nSome studies even suggest that a soft economy may be the best time for businesses to grow their market share. If you\u2019re cutting back while your competitors are pushing ahead, you might lose out once the economy gets back on better footing.\n\nRelated: How to Maximize Your Startup\u2019s Content Marketing Budget\n\nConnect the physical with the digital\n\nSolopreneurs with physical businesses are having a particularly hard time right now as everybody has to stay indoors, but some have been able to pivot by bringing their offering online \u2014 or as online as they can.\n\nKajabi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Build Together\u201d campaign has been collecting stories from its users, and many of them deal with exactly this. For example, dog-training expert Connie Cleveland does 12 live events each year and hosts a two-day live workshop. That part of her business has completely collapsed, but after a recent event was cancelled, she reached out to everyone who had signed up and offered them a month of free membership for her online training business, The Obedience Road.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of people who took me up on that, which is great,\" says Cleveland. \"A month from now, they may drop off or they may not, but at least I got them into the membership site, where they\u2019ll get to know me and what I offer.\u201d\n\nRestaurants that never offered carryout or online ordering are now doing full online rollouts. Physical trainers are doing seminars from their home gyms. The advantage of being a is that you\u2019re more nimble than most businesses. Take advantage of it.\n\nFind a pain point and address it \u2014 immediately\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Warby Parker. The company that put direct-to-consumer eyeglasses on the map didn\u2019t start in good economic times \u2014 it actually started during a recession.\n\nCo-founder Dave Gilboa had to buy a new smartphone and a new pair of glasses around the same time and wondered why the glasses cost so much more than the phone. That thought coalesced into what became Warby Parker, and the rest is history, as they say.\n\nWhy did it succeed? The company provided a product people wanted at a cost below what anyone else could offer. No one to that point had been providing stylish eyeglasses for the price Warby Parker could. While money was tighter, this had a lot of appeal, and it proved resilient when the economy got back on track.\n\nCompanies like Coding Dojo, Stellari and Digital Ocean are pivoting to providing products and services that are required in present circumstances. Some fashion companies are repurposing material to create masks and other PPE, while other tech brands are providing support and free services for hard-hit businesses.\n\nWhen money gets tight and customers are in short supply, you can build a loyal audience by providing real value and helping people. That\u2019s true at any time, but doubly so now.\n\nRelated: Want to Build Better Products? Own Your Customers\u2019 Pain\n\nBe genuinely helpful\n\nCompanies that throw themselves into helping their communities and genuinely aiding people will reap the benefits, whereas a tone-deaf or selfish response will turn them off. The most important thing is to focus on genuine, authentic help first. Be altruistic. The business benefits will follow. Even if it seems like you\u2019re losing out in the short-term, you\u2019ll build relationships, appreciation and customers that will last far beyond this moment.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest takeaway from this for solopreneurs: Find ways to stay in business, but make sure you\u2019re providing a benefit that people can really use even while cooped up in their houses or dealing with sickness.

What I\u2019ve learned through each launch strategy and execution process is how important it is to be creative. If you're part of a community of , it's likely that someone is launching something on any given day. As exciting as that is to be part of, it can also be a challenge to stand out from the noise and complete your launch in a way that\u2019s specific to your personal brand and the brand of whatever it is that you\u2019re launching.\n\nRelated: This Creative Production Company Launched Almost 25 Years Ago. Its Ability to Evolve With the Market Kept It in Business.\n\nHere are some creative ideas that I\u2019ve put to the test in my own digital launches (specifically, the launch of my false lash line last year that did quite well) that can help you start thinking outside the box about your own upcoming launch. Remember: The more creative and unique you are in your launch strategy, the more eyeballs your launch will get.\n\n1. Unite with ambassadors to share the launch for you\n\nI firmly believe in \u201cgo big or go home.\u201d I\u2019ve had many launches where it felt like I was shouting into the void with just one post across all my social channels, and when I launched my lash company, I just didn\u2019t want it to be like that. So, I gathered a group of lash ambassadors: people who represented my \u201ctarget market\u201d (in this case, makeup and false lash lovers) who could partake in the launch with me. I sent them two pairs of free lashes, asked them to take photos with the glitter lash box and wearing the lashes, and we all posted at the very same time.\n\nRelated: Learn Graphic Design and Launch Your Own Business\n\nIn addition to the added exposure (and the fun!), it was a chance to see my product in all of its diversity. Each of your ambassadors will use or embrace your product a little differently, and seeing everyone\u2019s creative take together creates a full picture of what your product can do. Given, this was a bit easier for me because it was a product that could be worn, but the same principle applies if you\u2019re launching a book or a program. Can you first do a mini launch on a small beta group and give them your product for free in exchange for their inclusion in your concerted launch efforts? The more you give them creative reign over their posts here, the better.\n\n2. Creative, bold digital assets\n\nIn a digital launch, the more creative you can be with your fonts, color scheme, social media posts and landing page, the better. I was recently talking with Layla Parr, the founder of the Launch Societe, a company that focuses specifically on launches. I loved her language about what she helps female founders do: \u201cCombine her warring energies into a harmonious launch.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m certainly not a graphic designer, but I have been able to create the digital assets for each of my launches. Parr told me that her best advice is to \u201creach for the highest vision for what you want the launch to feel like, then find fonts and colors that can imitate that same feel.\u201d That stuck with me.\n\nRelated: Learn How to Start a Creative Side Hustle as a Photographer\n\nI spent a great deal of time perusing online resources like Creative Market to find fonts that matched my expression. This exploration is important \u2014 I urge you to not just go for the status quo fonts and templates. Make a splash! The bolder the digital assets, the higher the chance that one of your followers will actually pause their mindless scrolling to look at what you\u2019re launching.\n\n3. Make a fun countdown\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your digital assets, create some suspense before you launch. I didn\u2019t tell anyone outside my ambassador group and close friends that I was about to launch my line of lashes. To drum up interest, I posted faded images of me wearing my product in a non-obvious way with the overlaid numbers of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d and then \u201c1\u201d leading up to the launch day. I put the date of the launch in the caption, too. This suspense creates a sense of investment for your audience. The more they can wonder about what's coming and feel excited about it, the more momentous your launch will feel.\n\n4. Host a giveaway\n\nFinally, a few weeks after the launch, consider hosting a giveaway on your social channels to stir up enthusiasm again. Give away anywhere from one to five of your products or seats in your upcoming course, and ask followers to enter by tagging friends and liking the photo. This will enhance your product\u2019s visibility even more. I also found that doing this giveaway was a great way to engage audience members who weren\u2019t initially interested in my product or service in the heat of the launch but would be interested in trying it for free if they won the giveaway. This way, you don\u2019t lose or delay any purchases from people who were going to buy to begin with. It just reignites enthusiasm in the \"middle tier\" of your audience members who need an extra push to invest in your product.\n\nTry these ideas out for yourself, or put your own spin on them. Digital launches are my favorite because there are no boundaries to how creative you can be. Show the world what you\u2019re made of, and make them pay attention. Your launch deserves it.\n\nRelated: 3 Memorable Ways to Launch a Product to Wow Customers", "author": ["Haley Hoffman Smith"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/SQyV6UD4RqI/349969", "published": "2020-05-06T16:30:00", "title": "5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy", "text": "May 6, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWe are all doing our best to cope under the current circumstances, and I believe that within adversity lies an opportunity to change, evolve and adapt.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an individual, entrepreneur or brand, the need of the hour is to reassess, rethink and reinvent your approach. While influencers, billionaires and corporations are joining hands to aid those in need, brands need to sustain business activities and simultaneously make a positive contribution to those around them.\n\nI recently spoke with brand strategist Alex McCurry, founder of Astra Media, which is helping businesses, brands and entrepreneurs reinvent their digital marketing strategy. Our conversation inspied me to share the following five ways in which brands can rethink their online strategy and make relevant offerings as we all turn our focus toward .\n\nGo Digital\n\nWith people spending much more time on social media platforms than ever before, brands need to shift focus to their digital operations and look for effective ways to connect, interact and transact with their audience. McCurry says that several brands and large brick-and-mortar retailers are now looking to strengthen their digital presence to sustain operations, be it by leveraging ecommerce or offering special incentives.\n\n\u201cI think companies are beginning to understand the importance of social media and digital presence,\" he argues. \"I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until even the most stubborn executives begin to see the value of these digital tools.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Ecommerce Companies Can Continue Engaging New Customers\n\nBe Compassionate\n\nNow is the time when we must do all we can to help each other. For brands, it is a unique opportunity to think outside the box and create innovative ideas that enable them to come forward and make a difference. \u201cBeing greedy or calloused during times of strife can be suicidal for companies,\" McCurry cautions. \"On the other hand, showing a level of compassion and selflessness can help build long-term customer loyalty.\u201d\n\nAn example that comes to mind is how Bacardi shifted production to supply methanol and help manufacture hand sanitizers. Bacardi has a massive presence online and launched a campaign dubbed #raiseyourspirits, which raised $3 million to support local bars and restaurants who were suffering due to the outbreak.\n\n\n\nRethink Offerings\n\nDuring a global health crisis, there are bound to be rapid changes in both consumer behavior and market dynamics. It is essential to monitor brand communication at all times and quickly adapt to changing circumstances. McCurry points to how Dyson is considering a shift in production to create 15,000 ventilators to help the UK\u2019s Nation Health Service and cope with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cBeing timely and understanding the importance of how market conditions and other changes can affect the relevancy of your product is imperative,\" he says. \"Remaining relevant and self-aware of your product can often determine whether you succeed or not during times like this.\u201d\n\nDyson kept tabs on the situation and chose to make a significant alteration in their line of production. Rather than marketing hairdryers and vacuum cleaners, they decided to change their stance by providing much needed medical equipment, ultimately saving lives.\n\nSupport a Cause\n\nThough business may be slow at the moment, it offers brands the opportunity to reach out to their audience online and initiate new and meaningful conversations. You must understand what customers expect from you as a brand and how it can be delivered.\n\nMcCurry shares an interesting example: Kenneth Cole decided to donate 20 percent of all its online sales to the Solidarity Response Fund created by the World Health Organization. Since everyone is holed up at home, leading gyms and fitness studios are offering free at-home workouts along with video-based guides and tutorials for exercises.\n\n\u201cPeople like to be affiliated with projects that they think are making a difference,\" McMurry reasons. \"The power of philanthropy and social entrepreneurship is huge, as it dramatically increases a consumer's confidence in your brand.\u201d\n\nSolve Pertinent Issues\n\nIt is essential to communicate often and effectively how your brand is helping consumers face challenges. \u201cAll of the compassion and lip service in the world is meaningless without action,\" states McCurry. \"By providing real, tangible solutions, it shows consumers that you truly practice what you preach.\u201d\n\nAs examples, think of how restaurants are now providing customers no-contact doorstep delivery or the way big-box stores like Walmart have allocated special hours for senior citizens, ensuring they can stock up on essentials without any risk.\n\nRelated: The 3 Most Valuable Things Entrepreneurs Can Be Doing for Their Team Right Now\n\n\n\nIn my own experience, sometimes a brand needs to stop thinking about statistics, revenue and returns and start thinking of genuine ways to add value and alleviate current stresses.

Apart from that, however, there are quite a few differences that make marketing a service business more complicated and difficult.\n\nFor one, you can't mass-produce services like you can with products, and the customer\u2019s input is much more pronounced. An uncooperative customer can degrade service quality significantly, unlike products which you can design to be fool-proof. Nonetheless, marketing is a crucial part of success in any service industry and you must get it right. Here are a few tips to do just that:\n\nDifferentiation for initial awareness\n\nUnlike with products where there will be reviews and even the most minute differences will be highlighted to place rank one product over another, most service businesses are similar in what they deliver. So to break into a market, you\u2019ll need to identify one area to center your unique selling proposition around.\n\nIt could be lower pricing, faster turnaround time, or specialization, but there must be something that will make customers consider moving to your service as opposed to the more established firms. After they hire you, you can help them see other ways your service is better, but that initial differentiation is key to landing new customers.\n\nRene Langer, CEO of PICKHVAC \u2014 which developed an online tool to connect contractors and clients \u2014 says that, \u201cWhen trying to establish your presence through pricing, it\u2019s important to be cautious in your approach. Too aggressive and you\u2019ll find yourself relegated to the low-end of the market with razor thin margins, while if you don\u2019t go low enough, you might not be able to turn enough heads to give your business the critical mass it needs. It\u2019s better to focus more on value than on price per se. Use incentives and bundles to make customers understand they\u2019ll get better bang for their buck with you.\"\n\nRelated: 3 Content Marketing Tips for Your Service Business\n\nStellar customer service to gain referrals\n\nNowadays, customer service is one of the most important considerations for any service-oriented business. It\u2019s also a crucial factor in how likely your customers are to refer their friends and family, so getting it right must be a focal point of your marketing efforts.\n\nThe first step is to train your staff extensively to be sure they understand the value of exceptional customer service and how to provide it. Many customers will not bother to report, but bad customer service from any of your staff will leave them determined to stay away from your business in the future. Apart from training, providing great customer support is essential, even after a service has been concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to go overboard though \u2013 you do not want to become that person who is always sending spammy emails and eventually gets blocked. Instead, reach out occasionally with valuable information related to your service. That way, you\u2019ll keep your business top of mind and also ensure that you\u2019re leaving a positive impression for the next time a former client needs the services you provide.\n\nRelated: Video Marketing for Service Businesses\n\nNimble marketing\n\nYour competitors are not going to be sitting still while you come in and take all the customers. It\u2019s likely that over time, they are going to be switching things up as well, especially because service business\u2019 brands are more flexible than product brands.\n\nAnd flexibility is a point in your favor, if you harness it correctly. Be sure to keep an eye on your marketing metrics to see what\u2019s working and what needs to be changed, and it\u2019s crucial to have your social media monitoring in good hands as well so you can respond quickly and appropriately whenever something comes up on social media. If handled astutely, positive or negative feedback can be turned into good publicity for your brand.\n\nOn the whole, marketing a service business is complicated. But when done properly you can come into a market, stake your position, and increase your market share over time.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways Service-Based Businesses Can Market on Instagram", "author": ["Pritom Das"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/eMkRSSyBMic/349932", "published": "2020-05-01T13:00:00", "title": "Make Your Branding and Marketing Content Pop with This Easy-to-Use $30 Digital Illustrator", "text": "May 1, 2020 2 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

REUTERS/Stephen Yang/File Photo\n\nAs some state economies begin to reopen, we invited a group of small business experts to return for a follow-up discussion as part of our #AskReuters Twitter chat series.\n\nBelow are edited highlights.\n\nWhy and how have small businesses been impacted by this pandemic?\n\n\u201cMany small businesses have been disproportionately impacted because they do not have the cash reserves and borrowing power to sustain their operations and their business models are not always designed to generate monthly recurring revenues.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Bob Chalfin, lecturer in management at The Wharton School of the University of Pennsylvania\n\nMany small businesses are still waiting for federal aid. Any tips on cutting through red tape and staying afloat?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m hearing that Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) loan processing time has improved considerably recently, so there may be hope. Also consider local and state funding; many cities are offering cash grants and other support for local businesses.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Janet Alvarez, executive editor of Wise Bread\n\nIn addition to federal aid programs, what more can policymakers, financial institutions and even consumers do to respond to the needs of small businesses?\n\n\u201cIf there was ever a time for rules to be broken, suspended, and rethought by lenders, landlords and credit agencies now is the time. See what all of those above can do to help.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michael Sherrod, entrepreneur-in-residence at Texas Christian University Neeley School of Business\n\nWhen it comes to aid and loans, there is some confusion about what needs to be paid back and when. How should small businesses approach their repayment plans?\n\n\u201cCarefully! Keep a close eye on your working capital ups and downs (and seasonality) as you plan out cash flow. Don\u2019t be afraid to ask your bank to slow down your repayment schedule if you can demonstrate need \u2013 but being on top of your numbers is key to make that ask!\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tom Schryver, lecturer at the Johnson Graduate School of Management of Cornell University\n\nWhat are the biggest mistakes you have seen small businesses make since the crisis hit?\n\n\u201cThe biggest mistake I have seen is panic based on rumors. The situation is changing so fast that rumors abound. Stay informed, check rumors out with your network.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Tom Sullivan, vice president for small business policy at U.S. Chamber of Commerce\n\nWhat are some of the smartest moves you have seen small businesses make in the midst of the pandemic?\n\n\u201cSome of the smarter small business owners rapidly adapted to messaging, such as by reaching out via social media or cold calling customers, letting them they are still open, for example, for take out home delivery.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Kashif A. Ahmed, founder and president of American Private Wealth, LLC\n\nFor many small businesses, reopening will be akin to opening for the first time. What advice do you have to plan \u2013 and pay \u2013 for reopening?\n\n\u201cReopen in stages. Lay out a schedule to ramp up. Business is likely to be slow at first. Better to run out of product than to have too much early on. Coordinate with vendors & suppliers to have the product you need at each stage. Focus on cash flow.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Carl Peterson, vice president of small firm interests at the American Institute of CPAs\n\nAs the economy starts to reopen, what are the key changes small businesses will need to make to succeed?\n\n\u201cUnderstand your customers and adjust to meet their needs, including providing a safe environment for staff and patrons.

On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) cut its payout for the first time since World War Two as part of a plan to save $30 billion to help it weather an unprecedented decline in oil demand.\n\nYet some managers of divided funds - which seek to give their clients exposure to a steady stream of income - believe the beaten-down sector may hold companies that are likely to keep their dividends intact and see their share prices rise. The sector has rebounded 28.5% from its March lows, compared with 26.3% for the S&P 500.\n\n\u201cThe initial moves were very emotionally based and now we\u2019re getting back to fundamentals,\u201d said Scott Davis, a senior portfolio manager at Columbia Threadneedle Investments who oversees $24 billion in income strategies. \u201cThere is still going to be volatility but we think you can pick your spots.\u201d\n\nDavis has recently added to positions such as Home Depot Inc (HD.N), Chevron Corp (CVX.N) and Union Pacific Corp (UNP.N) that have attractive free cash flows despite being in industries that have been among the hardest-hit by the slowdown. Both companies offer a dividend yield of approximately 2.5%.\n\nCompanies like Walmart Inc (WMT.N) and Home Depot that have free cash flow growth above 6% will likely be able to invest and grow their market shares during a recession, while those such as Macy\u2019s Inc (M.N) could end up in bankruptcy, he said.\n\n\u201cI have a feeling that some of those trends that were already in play will only get accelerated,\u201d said Davis.\n\nU.K. and European companies will likely cut dividends more than their U.S. counterparts, which are more likely to reduce share buybacks first, said Mark Peden, investment manager, Equities, at Kames Capital.\n\nCompanies like cruise line operator Carnival Corp (CCL.N) and British retailer Marks and Spencer Group PLC (MKS.L) likely will not restore their dividends to previous levels, but other companies will want to increase theirs as early as possible to demonstrate their financial health, he said.\n\nWhile dividend-paying stocks may provide the cushion of a payout, their dividends - and share prices - could be in jeopardy if a subsequent wave of the virus deals another blow to growth by forcing countries to reinstate or extend lockdown measures.\n\nAnalysts at BofA Global Research urged investors to focus on companies whose dividends are likely to be secure, rather than comparatively rich.\n\n\u201cThe massive economic disruption brought on by COVID-19 questions the sustainability of dividends,\u201d the bank\u2019s analysts wrote.\n\nAt the same time, historically low borrowing costs have prompted many companies without strong balance sheets to initiate dividends since the end of the 2008 financial crisis, noted Linda Bakhshian, a portfolio manager at Federated Hermes.\n\nWhile many of those companies will be forced to cut their dividends, cash-rich firms in growing sectors like healthcare and technology are the most likely to maintain or even increase their payouts through what could be a painful recession ahead, she said.\n\n\u201cYou\u2019re going to see soon which companies are going to come out of this on the other side stronger,\u201d she said.", "author": ["David Randall", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/0gOIp8voe6I/your-unemployment-questions-answered-idUSKBN22C37G", "published": "2020-04-30T18:16:13", "title": "Your unemployment questions, answered", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. jobless claims have exceeded 30 million since the coronavirus outbreak hit the country, wiping out a decade of job gains and sending many Americans scrambling to find work and cash in on government aid.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A person walks by the entrance of the New York State Department of Labor offices, which closed to the public due to the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, U.S., March 20, 2020.

Ask your boss about work sharing as an alternative to layoffs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project\n\nWhat benefits are available to contractors or gig-economy workers who have seen their salaries disappear?\n\n\u201cContractors, check with your state to see if they\u2019ve extended benefits.

California also approved contractors to receive benefits through pandemic unemployment assistance.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Raymond Lee, founder and chief executive of Careerminds\n\nAny guidance on looking for a job?\n\n\u201cLean on your network.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nRest assured there are options, even if they are all expensive.\n\nIf you are losing a workplace plan, you will get paperwork explaining your benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, which allows you to continue on your same plan. The catch is that you have to pay the full amount of the premiums, not just the employee portion.\n\n\u201cThe employer was typically paying 50 to 100% of the cost, that\u2019s why COBRA is so expensive,\u201d said Anthony Lopez, vice president of operations for eHealth.com https://www.ehealthinsurance.com, a nationwide aggregator.\n\nLopez said most people calling eHealth now are looking for other options besides COBRA, and that means going through the state exchanges, private insurance or short-term plans. You can also go to state websites, healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov or directly to insurance companies to find rates for your personal situation.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d Lopez said, mostly because they fear they will not be able to get health insurance.\n\nLopez said he was not seeing denials, which is reassuring, but then the fear turns into sticker shock.\n\nThe key to picking the best plan is to figure out if it is better to pay less for the premium, but more of the actual cost of the care through a high deductible - and which level to choose.\n\nThe average monthly premium for 2020 was $456 for individuals and $1,134 for families, according to eHealth\u2019s latest analysis. Deductibles averaged $4,263 for individuals and $7,893 for families, meaning this is how much they would have to pay out of pocket, excluding services like well visits for children, before the insurance starts to pay.\n\nOptions for high-deductible plans have been prevalent for years, even through employer plans, but many would have these costs offset by the employer paying a big chunk of the premium and also contributing a lump sum toward the deductible.\n\nHelp might be available for premium reductions for those who qualify for government subsidies. The math will be a little tricky right now though, because the calculation is based on your last tax return. If you estimate your income based on your job loss, and then you get another job, you may owe a penalty, Lopez warned.\n\nDEALING WITH DEDUCTIBLES\n\nIt is not just Americans facing job losses who have to face the reality of high deductibles because of COVID-19. Those still on their workplace plans, who may have been furloughed but are able to keep their insurance, are having to manage their costs more than ever.\n\nResearchers at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy studied what happens financially to people who switch from traditional health plans to high-deductible plans, and found there was a significant increase in out-of-pocket spending and excessive financial burden.\n\n\u201cIf you are healthy and lucky, then a high deductible is a great thing for you,\u201d said Neeraj Sood, a professor at USC who worked on the study.\n\nNone of us is very lucky right now, however.\n\nIn reality, it is very easy to rip through a deductible of several thousand dollars. A couple of trips to urgent care at full price or an afternoon in an emergency room could do it.\n\nEven if the test for COVID-19 is a covered expense, there are all sorts of other costs you could face if you fall ill, and you are on the hook for normal healthcare costs too.\n\nIt takes advance planning to properly deal with these expenses, and that will not be something everyone can pull off with stretched finances.\n\nJeff Hicks, a certified financial planner from Illinois, is one model. He has had a $10,000 family deductible plan for nearly 20 years, and each year religiously puts aside the full amount of the deductible in a Health Savings Account, which is a specialized pre-tax account that also grows tax-free.\n\nFor the first four years, he spent none of it. Then his wife got very sick, and they went the next four years spending the full amount. Since then, they have gone back and forth on the spending.\n\n\u201cOnce she had this catastrophic deal, I knew we were looking at potentially having it every year. I resigned myself to the fact that this may be the path we\u2019re on,\u201d Hicks said.", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/0g2D71vYeK8/scaramuccis-skybridge-hit-with-heavy-redemption-requests-as-fund-fell-letter-idUSKCN22634P", "published": "2020-04-24T20:23:18", "title": "Scaramucci's SkyBridge hit with heavy redemption requests as fund fell: letter", "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors in SkyBridge Capital asked for hundreds of millions of dollars back after the fund suffered a 23% loss in March when investments made by its debt-focused hedge fund managers soured, Anthony Scaramucci wrote in a letter to clients, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the loss.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Anthony Scaramucci, Founder and Co-Managing Partner at SkyBridge Capital, speaks during the opening remarks during the SALT conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. May 17, 2017.

Do not share this,\u201d advised Gaines, who is an enrolled agent based in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe Economic Impact Payments to individuals are technically refundable tax credits on your 2020 return, which means they exist separately from whatever your tax liability will be for that year. When you file your return, there will be some kind of worksheet to input the payment you already received and it will tally up the correct amount you should have received.\n\nIf you got too little, you will receive the difference. If you got too much, you get to keep it. (Yes, keep it, no strings attached.)\n\nKubey revisited the language from the 2008 return, when there was a similar stimulus payment following the financial crash. \u201cThe instructions pretty clearly said: if you got too much, you don\u2019t have to pay it back.\u201d\n\n\u2018THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!\u2019\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Alan Pinck, an enrolled agent based in San Jose, California. He is dealing with a client whose husband passed away in 2019 and will be getting a stimulus payment for her spouse.\n\nDundon has a client who was single in 2018 and got a payment for herself and two kids. She got married in 2019 and filed a return with her new husband, who has one child. They got a payment for two adults and three children.\n\nDivorced couples who alternate claiming their children or who split the children may have some reconciling to do.\n\nPeople who had children before the end of 2020, or whose children turn 17 in this time frame, will also have wonky math.\n\nThose who made more or less in any of the years used to calculate the payments will have to work it out in 2020.\n\n\u201cI truly do not believe that Congress realized that there are so many different scenarios for this money,\u201d said enrolled agent Morris Armstrong, based in Connecticut.\n\nWHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT?\n\nIf you need money now, it is no solace to be told that this will all be resolved in a year, but that is the only true answer right now.\n\n\u201cWe can do the math, but we don\u2019t know with any certainty what the IRS is actually doing,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cThey are just an agency doing what they are told.

When it is expected money like a tax refund, they tend to be practical and do things like pay down debt or make a large planned purchases.\n\nNewcomb said she did not yet know what she was going to do with the deposit that had just landed in her own account.

The government intended the stimulus to help get the economy going again. People need money to move and change hands, and every transaction that gets halted ripples out to affect many people.\n\nOne way Newcomb has found that shifts behavior in situations like these is to turn anxiety into excitement - a theory called anxiety reappraisal in a paper by Harvard Business School professor Alison Wood Brooks that Newcomb cites in her work.\n\n\u201cIf we could trust that we will find a solution to the virus, then I think we would all feel easier about letting that money go. There has to be a sense that you\u2019re going to be OK. That\u2019s the missing piece,\u201d Newcomb said.\n\nUntil that happens, some people are being motivated by the spirit of philanthropy.

Bernstein/File Photo\n\nA higher Medicare age was an awful policy idea when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives pitched it in 2017 (reut.rs/3cjvT01). It was just as bad in various proposals from Paul Ryan to reform federal spending when he ran the House Budget Committee and served as speaker of the House. And just imagine what it could have meant during today's coronavirus outbreak, which disproportionately affects older adults who rely on Medicare.\n\nThe pandemic has made the yawning gaps and inequities in our health insurance system painfully obvious. And until now, the dream of universal health insurance coverage has seemed very distant.\n\nBut last week, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden became the first major-party candidate to call to expand access to Medicare by reducing the eligibility age to 60. This is a remarkable turning point - the standard bearer of a major party actually is calling for significant expansion of a government program. \u201cSuddenly, the government doesn\u2019t seem to be such a bad actor anymore,\u201d said Marilyn Moon, one of the nation\u2019s top experts on Medicare.\n\nMoon is an economist and former public trustee of both Medicare and Social Security. She co-chaired a recent study on ways to expand Medicare eligibility by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI).\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal was a concession to the progressive wing of his party aimed at unity for the fall election, and it was a step in the right direction. But the NASI report shows that dropping the Medicare age to 60 would be no more than a very incremental step. A new battle over health reform surely will emerge in the wake of the pandemic, and the outcome we need is universal, affordable health coverage for all that improves the quality of care.\n\nTHREE APPROACHES TO REFORM\n\nThe NASI study bit.ly/2K4Aya7 offers a fascinating in-depth look at three approaches to expanding Medicare eligibility: lowering the eligibility age, establishing Medicare for All, and creating a Medicare buy-in. The report was created by a study panel made up of 27 experts from a broad range of perspectives, such as economics, health policy, political science, sociology, medicine and law.\n\nThe report draws some surprising conclusions about the practicality of actually executing these approaches. Yes, Medicare for All might be the toughest putt from a political standpoint - but the optional buy-in - which sounded great rolling off the tongues of moderate candidates like Pete Buttigieg - actually is the most difficult to execute.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that Medicare for All sounds nice, but that it is aspirational and very difficult, if not impossible to do in practice,\u201d said Moon. \u201cAnd the buy-in just sounds like it\u2019s not a big change. But we quickly realized that the buy-in was very complicated, because you take a complicated program like Medicare, which has a lot of moving parts, and then the even more complex Affordable Care Act structure and you try to marry the two in some way. It\u2019s very difficult to do.\u201d\n\nMedicare for All could achieve nearly universal coverage, and yield sizable administrative savings. But there are plenty of questions about how exactly it would be executed. These include the continued role - if any - of private insurance like Medicare Advantage, Medigap and prescription drug plans; benefits and cost sharing and financing mechanisms, to name just a few. From a political standpoint, a push for Medicare for All would provoke a donnybrook with the powerful health insurance lobby if it includes an end of commercial health insurance as we know it.\n\nA SWEET SPOT?\n\nReducing the Medicare age might just be the sweet spot, because it is fairly straightforward to implement and might not provoke the same intensity of political opposition.\n\nBut if we want to make a meaningful difference in healthcare coverage in this country, the age would need to move much lower than 60. The NASI study found that an entry point of age 62 would add 10.1 million to the Medicare rolls, but only 670,000 who had been uninsured because this older age group already has a comparatively low uninsured rate. Of course, that figure could be much higher now due to COVID-19-induced job losses.\n\nDropping the eligibility age to 50 would add 57.3 million new enrollees, 4.6 million of whom would have been uninsured. But that would come with its own set of questions. \u201cYou begin to change the nature of the people that are being covered, including many more families with children - but Medicare is an individually based insurance program,\u201d said Moon. \u201cYou also have to figure out whether or not the payment rates that Medicare uses that help make it inexpensive would be adequate for healthcare providers who suddenly would be covering many more of their patients under Medicare.\u201d\n\nA lower Medicare age would come with a few other complications, starting with how to finance the expansion. Medicare Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) are paid for with a combination of enrollee premiums and government general revenue. But Part A (hospitalization) is financed through a payroll tax paid in advance by workers. The fund's actuarial assumptions are premised on serving only the 65-and-older population, and it already is on thin ice, facing an exhaustion date of 2026. (reut.rs/2RBxUwP) That date will likely move even closer due to the unanticipated cost of\n\ncaring for coronavirus patients.\n\nBiden has proposed to protect the Part A trust fund by financing the expense of serving new, younger enrollees from general revenue, rather than the payroll tax.\n\nIt is far too early in the pandemic crisis to know where this debate will go, and much will depend on the political makeup of Washington next year. But as the saying goes, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste nyti.ms/2ykhKkl.\n\nFor more on Medicare expansion, check out my podcast interview this week with Marilyn Moon bit.ly/3adkttp.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)", "author": ["Mark Miller", "Min Read"]}]}, "reuters_science": {"rss": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/scienceNews", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/news/science", "articles": [{"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/ih_pijsP-ik/star-trek-not-star-wars-nasa-releases-basic-principles-for-moon-exploration-pact-idUSKBN22R2Z9", "published": "2020-05-15T20:26:09", "title": "'Star Trek, not Star Wars:' NASA releases basic principles for moon exploration pact", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NASA on Friday set the stage for a global debate over the basic principles governing how humans will live and work on the moon, as it released the main tenets of an international pact for moon exploration called the Artemis Accords.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The full moon, also known as the Supermoon or Flower Moon, rises above the Statue of Liberty, as seen from Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S., May 7, 2020.

Among 154 coronavirus patients at two nursing homes, those who took a statin, such as Lipitor, were nearly three times more likely to be free of symptoms during their infection than those who did not, researchers in Belgium found. There was also slight trend toward lower risks for lengthy hospital stays and death that was not statistically significant. The study was not randomized, so more formal trials are needed to definitively prove that statins affect outcomes. \"In the current absence of other valuable therapies and considering the benefit-risk balance, an older person living in a nursing home could consider taking a statin if at high COVID-19 infection risk,\" the authors advised. The study, reported on Friday on the medRxiv website, has not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2X3K57g)\n\nCOVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease\n\nThe desperate need of severely ill coronavirus patients for mechanical ventilators to help them breathe had led many people to think of COVID-19 primarily as a respiratory disease, at least in adults. But among nearly 5,500 coronavirus patients in the largest New York health system, more than one in three hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed acute kidney injuries, and nearly 15% required dialysis, researchers reported on Thursday in the medical journal Kidney International. Other research teams have reported that the virus can infect cells in the small intestine. And on Wednesday, researchers reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that autopsies of 27 people who died of COVID-19 showed the virus in tissues of 17 hearts, 17 livers, 8 brains and the kidneys of 13 people. There have also been reports of the virus causing blood clots that can lead to strokes. ( bit.ly/3fYw9o3 bit.ly/2Z6KXLe)\n\nConvalescent plasma is safe but not conclusively proven to help\n\nResearchers around the world are studying whether hospitalized coronavirus patients can be helped by infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the virus, so-called convalescent plasma. It is not yet clear whether or to what extent convalescent plasma provides benefit, but a large study shows the treatment is safe. U.S. researchers analyzed data from 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening coronavirus infections who received the treatment as part of a U.S. FDA Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma for COVID-19 patients. Fewer than 1% of patients had any serious adverse effects in the first four hours after transfusion, researchers found. The findings, published on Thursday on the medRxiv website, have not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2AA7hml)\n\nFlu data can help coronavirus case estimates; less reliable for deaths\n\nOne way to get a better sense of how the coronavirus spread in the United States, researchers suggest, is to look at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on the number of people with flu-like symptoms and estimate how many of them were actually diagnosed with the flu. The ones who were not may have had coronavirus infections instead. Researchers looked at the number of prescriptions for oseltamivir, an antiviral specifically used to treat influenza. According to their report on Friday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, when they compared the CDC-reported flu-like illness levels with their estimate of actual flu diagnoses based on oseltamivir prescriptions, they concluded that by April 4 there were already more than 2.5 million coronavirus cases in the United States. (bit.ly/2AAm2Wh)\n\nOn the other hand, flu mortality estimates are not a helpful tool for comparing the deadliness of the flu and the coronavirus, a separate report says. Most people do not realize that CDC numbers for influenza deaths are just estimates, whereas COVID-19 deaths numbers are actual counts, Dr. Jeremy Faust of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters. Writing in JAMA Internal Medicine on Thursday, he and a coauthor say that between the 2013-2014 and 2018-2019 flu seasons, the estimated annual number of flu deaths ranged from 23,000 to 61,000 - but over the same period, the yearly number of counted influenza deaths was between 3,448 and 15,620. In contrast, during just the week ending April 21, 2020, there were 15,455 U.S. COVID-19 deaths reported. The reported number of U.S. coronavirus-related deaths from the previous week, ending April 14, was 14,478.\" (bit.ly/2WSAUq8)\n\nGraphic: The lifeline pipeline, COVID-19 treatments, vaccines in development here", "author": ["Nancy Lapid", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/C8Ua4hKmp_w/how-sewer-science-could-ease-testing-pressure-and-track-covid-19-idUSKBN22Q2I8", "published": "2020-05-14T16:07:05", "title": "How sewer science could ease testing pressure and track COVID-19", "text": "LONDON (Reuters) - The science of sewage surveillance could be deployed in countries across the world to help monitor the spread of national epidemics of COVID-19 while reducing the need for mass testing, scientists say.\n\nA scientist works in the lab at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh, Scotland, amid the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19), May 13, 2020.

Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. \"There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,\" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (bit.ly/3fJIRqp)\n\nTwin antibodies may be better than one\n\nScientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a \"cocktail\" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity.

Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children\u2019s asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. \u201cEven in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,\u201d Kung said. \u201cThis suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.\u201d\n\n(bit.ly/3cuDM3j)\n\nScientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genome\n\nResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. \"This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,\" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. \"The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes.\" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed.

In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

The higher levels of \"angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,\" or ACE2, in men's blood might mean their organs have more of the ACE2 \"receptors\" the virus uses to get into cells, researchers suggest in a paper published on Monday in European Heart Journal. Their study involved more than 2,000 elderly men and women with heart failure but no coronavirus infection, many of whom were taking common blood pressure drugs that block the effect of this enzyme, known as ACE2 inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The researchers emphasize that study participants receiving these medications did not have higher levels of ACE2, which adds to earlier evidence that the drugs do not increase people's risk for coronavirus infection.

The time it took for at least half the patients to have negative coronavirus tests was seven days with add-on interferon, compared to 12 days without it, researchers reported on Sunday in The Lancet. Overall, 86 patients received the interferon-containing combination and 41 got the antivirals without interferon. When the study started, half the patients had already been symptomatic for more than five days. The combination that included interferon \"also alleviated symptoms completely within four days - a significantly shorter time than the control,\" researchers said, adding that a larger trial to confirm these results is needed.

The study, which was posted online on Monday on the MedRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed, found fewer than 0.5% of all pregnant women were hospitalized with the disease, and only around 10% of those women needed intensive care. Most pregnant women who were admitted to hospital were more than six months pregnant, the study also found.\n\nA separate study from Sweden, however, found pregnant women there do appear to face higher risks. Swedish national registry data, published on Sunday in the medical journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, showed that compared to nonpregnant women infected with the coronavirus, similarly aged pregnant women with the virus were more than five times as likely to need intensive care and four times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation. The authors of an editorial accompanying the study advise that, \"on the basis of available data...the risk of COVID-19 in pregnancy should not be down-played to avoid falsely reassuring healthcare professionals and the public. Women should be advised to take necessary precautions to avoid infection during pregnancy.\" (;reut.rs/3bqgmdU;bit.ly/35RUB5u;bit.ly/3coDAma)\n\nGraphic: The lifeline pipeline, COVID-19 treatments, vaccines in development here", "author": ["Nancy Lapid", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/zFNwAqG6AoM/abbott-coronavirus-test-is-accurate-infected-mothers-breast-milk-may-protect-infants-idUSKBN22K2GE", "published": "2020-05-08T18:36:57", "title": "Abbott coronavirus test is accurate; infected mother's breast milk may protect infants", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak, shared with Reuters on February 18, 2020. NEXU Science Communication/via REUTERS\n\nNew coronavirus antibody test highly accurate\n\nA new antibody test is highly accurate at determining whether people have been infected with the novel coronavirus, according to a study published on Friday in The Journal of Clinical Microbiology. Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine found the test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, had a specificity rate of 99.9% and a sensitivity rate of 100%, suggesting little chance of incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having been infected and virtually no chance of a false negative readout. Abbott's test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA and the company has already shipped more than 10 million of the tests to hospitals and labs. (Links: reut.rs/2xIdOdk bit.ly/2Lb24U3)\n\nCoronavirus antibodies in breast milk may protect infants\n\nBreast milk from infected mothers may contain antibodies to the novel coronavirus that could be protective for babies, a study suggests. \"Nursing mothers who are infected with the novel coronavirus should continue to breastfeed throughout their COVID-19 illness and beyond, because (other researchers) have shown transmission does not occur via milk, and we have determined that antibodies are almost certainly there, and may protect their babies from infection,\" Rebecca Powell of The Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai in New York, who led the study, told Reuters. Her team's report, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. (bit.ly/2WHvJcA)\n\nHydroxychloroquine fails to show benefit in hospitalized coronavirus patients\n\nIn a large observational study of hospitalized coronavirus patients, hydroxychloroquine - an old malaria drug championed by U.S. President Donald Trump as a \u201cgame changer\u201d in the fight against the virus - neither lessened patients\u2019 need for breathing assistance nor their risk of death, according to a report published on Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine.\n\n\"We didn't see any association between getting this medicine and the chance of dying or being intubated,\" lead researcher Dr. Neil Schluger, of New York-Presbyterian Hospital and Columbia University Irving Medical Center, told Reuters. \"The patients who got the drug didn't seem to do any better.\" Patients in the study were not randomly assigned to receive hydroxychloroquine or a placebo, the researchers noted, and so randomized trials, the gold standard for tests of new therapies, should continue.

British physicians reporting on Thursday in The Lancet said the children initially have fever, rash, conjunctivitis, lower-limb swelling, pain in arms and legs, and \"significant\" gastrointestinal symptoms, even without testing positive for the coronavirus. The syndrome, while rare, can rapidly progress to critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation.

Some of the men were already recovering from their illness.\n\n\"If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention,\" doctors at China's Shangqiu Municipal Hospital wrote in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Thursday, adding that more research is needed. (Links: reut.rs/2WhI2h0 bit.ly/3bm6JgA )\n\nPoor nasal swab technique may explain some false negative coronavirus tests\n\nPart of the reason for some false negative coronavirus tests - tests that do not detect the virus in someone who is actually infected - may be that the test sample was not collected properly by the person using the nasopharyngeal swab, Canadian researchers say. They reanalyzed specimens from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 whose test results had been negative or unclear and found less human DNA than they expected to see. Correct use of nasopharyngeal swabs to obtain a high quality specimen \"requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to ... a depth of roughly 7 centimeters (2.76 inches), followed by rotation and withdrawal,\" Zabrina Brumme of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and colleagues say. Their study, posted on Friday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal. ( bit.ly/2yGKG6J )\n\nCoronavirus spread affected more by public health measures than by climate\n\nTemperature and latitude do not appear to be associated with the spread of the novel coronavirus, and humidity levels have only a weak effect, according to data collected in March from 144 regions of the world. By contrast, public health measures like social distancing, school closures and sheltering at home do make a difference and were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth, Dr. Peter Juni at the University of Toronto and colleagues found in a report published on Friday in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).\n\n\"The important effect of public health interventions needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions,\" Juni's team concluded in their report.

Now, as major economies prepare green investments to kickstart growth, advocates spy a golden chance to drag the niche energy into the mainstream of a post-pandemic world.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The new Febus hydrogen bus is seen before a presentation in Pau, France, January 14, 2020. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nGreen hydrogen was pushed to the fore last week when Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said the technology was \u201cready for the big time\u201d and urged governments to channel investments into the fuel.\n\nSome countries, including the Netherlands, Australia and Portugal, have already begun investing in the technology. Now investors, politicians and businesses are pushing the European Union and others to use its post-crisis recovery plan to support hydrogen in areas like trucking and heavy industry.\n\nThe promise of hydrogen as a fuel to help power vehicles and energy plants has been a talking point since the 1970s, but it is currently too expensive for widespread use. Proponents say infrastructure investment and more demand from transport, gas grids and industry will bring the cost down.\n\nMost hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions, which defeats the object for many policymakers. But there is potential to extract \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity.\n\nEU officials, one of whom described green hydrogen as the \u201choly grail\u201d, said it could replace fossil fuels in sectors that lack alternatives to align operations with the EU\u2019s Green Deal plan to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cHydrogen could solve a lot of problems. We need everything else as well but the political interest is because to achieve deep energy efficiency and decarbonisation, hydrogen seems relatively easy,\u201d said Jesse Scott, senior advisor at think-tank Agora Energiewende.\n\n\u201cIt is less alarming (for policymakers) than some other elements for meeting net zero,\u201d she added, such as carbon removal technology for example.\n\nHYDROGEN GAINING MOMENTUM\n\nMomentum appears to be building; EU industry chief Thierry Breton met hydrogen companies online this week to discuss the bloc\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe could use these circumstances, where loads of public money are going to be needed into the energy system, to jump forward towards a hydrogen economy,\u201d said Diederik Samsom, who heads the European Commission\u2019s climate cabinet.\n\nThis could result in hydrogen use scaling up faster than was expected before the pandemic, he added.\n\nThe European Commission has earmarked clean hydrogen - a loose term which can include gas-based hydrogen, if fitted with technology to capture the resulting emissions - as a \u201cpriority area\u201d for industry in its Green Deal.\n\nOver the past year, several governments, including Germany, Britain, Australia and Japan, have announced or have been working on hydrogen strategies and the pace has picked up over the past month during the pandemic.\n\nThis week, Australia set aside A$300 million ($191 million) to jumpstart hydrogen projects. Portugal plans to build a new solar-powered hydrogen plant which will produce hydrogen by electrolysis by 2023.\n\nThe Netherlands unveiled a hydrogen strategy in late March, outlining plans for 500 megawatts (MW) of green electrolyser capacity by 2025. A German hydrogen strategy is expected later this month.\n\nThe Dutch government is pushing for the EU to follow suit and present an \u201caction plan\u201d for clean hydrogen, a spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nCAN IT BECOME AFFORDABLE?\n\nWhen it comes to transport, hydrogen fuel cells trail electric batteries in the push for greener cars, given their higher price and the lack of refuelling stations. But proponents see potential for heavier vehicles.\n\nDaimler and Volvo Trucks unveiled plans last month to bring hydrogen fuelled heavy-duty vehicles to market within the decade.\n\nHydrogen gas is already used in industry to produce ammonia, which goes into fertilisers, and methanol, used to make plastic.\n\nA major drawback of the green hydrogen that governments are most interested in, is that it requires a large amount of renewable electricity to produce. The good news is, renewables prices have fallen sharply in recent years.\n\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, hydrogen made from fossil fuels currently costs between $1-$1.8/kg. Green hydrogen can cost around $6/kg today, making it significantly more expensive than the fossil fuel alternatives.\n\nHowever, increased demand could reduce the cost of electrolysis. Coupled with falling renewable energy costs, green hydrogen could fall to $1.7/kg by 2050 and possibly sub-$1/kg, making it competitive with natural gas. Higher carbon prices would also encourage the shift.\n\n\u201cClean hydrogen produced from electricity is around three times more expensive than that from natural gas, but solar and wind costs have decreased in recent years and if they continue to fall, clean hydrogen produced with lower electricity costs would become more affordable,\u201d said Philippe Vie, global energy and utilities lead at consultancy Capgemini.\n\n\u201cOn hydrogen we are right now where we were with renewables in 2000-2005. Ten to 15 years is probably a good time lapse to become competitive,\u201d he added.\n\nMAJOR MONEY NEEDED\n\nAny serious attempt at large-scale use - either in industry or transportation - would also require major infrastructure investments. For example, power from an offshore wind farm would need to be connected to an electrolyser that produces the green hydrogen, which would then need to be transported to end users.\n\nEurope has around 135 MW of electrolyser capacity, but planned green hydrogen projects could bring that to 5.2 gigawatts, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. But many projects hinge on further investment partners or subsidies, which advocates fear will be scarcer in the COVID-19-induced economic slump.\n\n\u201cInvestments that would have been foreseen to be done now are not made because production is delayed,\u201d Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of lobby group Hydrogen Europe, told Reuters.\n\nTo help lower costs, several projects are being worked on across the gas infrastructure, industry, mining and energy sectors.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Dutch gas firm Gasunie unveiled plans in February to build a mammoth wind-powered hydrogen plant in the northern Netherlands, capable of producing 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen by 2040.\n\nIn Germany, oil refinery Raffinerie Heide is embarking on a project using excess wind energy and abundant water supply in the region to produce hydrogen to make kerosene.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe price of hydrogen we pay for now is four times natural gas from an external source fed through the pipeline and produced 30 km away,\u201d said CEO Juergen Wollschlaeger.\n\nA big fear for companies in the hydrogen industry is that they will be unable to take advantage of the unique opportunity presented by vast economic stimulus packages, and that governments will favour supporting traditional high-carbon fuel sectors that have been hit hard by a collapse in energy demand.\n\n\u201cFor us, that will be the question to be answered in the next weeks.

Patients who got this treatment were more likely to survive, the researchers reported on Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The difference was most pronounced among the 395 patients who needed mechanical ventilation. In this group, the death rate was 63% without anticoagulants and 29% when patients did get blood thinners.\n\nThe researchers note that because the study was not randomized, it cannot prove the drugs directly led to better survival. Large randomized trials are needed to confirm a benefit, researchers said, and any potential benefit needs to be weighed against the increased risk of bleeding with these drugs.

Researchers at MD Anderson Cancer Center in Houston found that having antibodies to two important structures on the surface of the virus does not necessarily mean patients\u2019 recovery will be faster or smoother.\n\nDr. Raghu Kalluri, who coauthored the study, told Reuters that patients with severe COVID-19 disease being treated in intensive care units had varying levels of antibodies. In fact, some recovered patients did not have these antibodies at all, which, he said, suggests that their immune systems fought off the virus in some unknown way. The study, posted on Tuesday on the preprint server medRxiv, has not yet been peer reviewed or published in a medical journal.

In the subset of studies that used particularly reliable tests to evaluate patients' ability to smell and taste, rates of dysfunction were even higher, suggesting \"that the true prevalence of dysfunction in COVID-19 patients may remain underestimated,\" the research team wrote on Tuesday in the journal Otolaryngology - Head and Neck Surgery.

After exploiting the capability of the European mobile platform MOLAB in situ and non-invasively at the Munch Museum in Oslo, the researchers came to the ESRF, the European Synchrotron (Grenoble, France), the world's brightest X-ray source, to carry out non-destructive experiments on micro-flakes originating from one of the most well-known versions of The Scream.

The study is published in Science Advances.\n\nThe Scream is among the most famous paintings of the modern era. The now familiar image is interpreted as the ultimate representation of anxiety and mental anguish. There are a number of versions of The Scream, namely two paintings, two pastels, several lithographic prints and a few drawings and sketches. The two most well-known versions are the paintings that Edvard Munch created in 1893 and 1910. Each version of The Scream is unique. Munch clearly experimented to find the exact colours to represent his personal experience, mixing diverse binding media (tempera, oil and pastel) with brilliant and bold synthetic pigments to make 'screaming colours'. Unfortunately, the extensive use of these new coloured materials poses a challenge for the long-term preservation of Munch's artworks.\n\nThe version of the Scream (1910?) that belongs to the Munch Museum (Oslo, Norway) clearly exhibits signs of degradation in different areas where cadmium-sulfide-based pigments have been used: cadmium yellow brushstrokes have turned to an off-white colour in the sunset cloudy sky and in the neck area of the central figure. In the lake, a thickly applied opaque cadmium yellow paint is flaking. Throughout its existence, several elements have played a role in the deterioration of the masterpiece: the yellow pigments used, the environmental conditions and a theft in 2004, when the painting disappeared for two years.\n\nSince the recovery of the painting after the theft, the masterpiece has rarely been shown to the public. Instead, it is preserved in a protected storage area in the Munch Museum, in Norway, under controlled conditions of lighting, temperature (about 18\u00b0C) and relative humidity (about 50%).\n\nAn international collaboration, led by the CNR (Italy), with the University of Perugia (Italy), the University of Antwerp (Belgium), the Bard Graduate Center in New York City (USA), the European Synchrotron (ESRF, France), the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) and the Munch Museum, has studied in detail the nature of the various cadmium-sulfide pigments used by Munch, and how these have degraded over the years.\n\nThe findings provide relevant hints about the deterioration mechanism of cadmium-sulfide-based paints, with significant implication for the preventive conservation of The Scream.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The synchrotron micro-analyses allowed us to pinpoint the main reason that made the painting decline, which is moisture. We also found that the impact of light in the paint is minor. I am very pleased that our study could contribute to preserve this famous masterpiece,\" explains Letizia Monico, one of the corresponding authors of the study.\n\nHitting the right formula for preservation\n\nMonico and her colleagues studied selected cadmium-sulfide-based areas of The Scream (1910?), as well as a corresponding micro-sample, using a series of non-invasive in-situ spectroscopic analyses with portable equipment of the European MOLAB platform in combination with the techniques of micro X-ray diffraction, X-ray micro fluorescence and micro X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy mainly at the ESRF, the European Synchrotron, in France, the world's most powerful synchrotron. The study of the painting was integrated with investigations of artificially aged mock-ups. The latter were prepared using a historical cadmium yellow pigment powder and a cadmium yellow oil paint tube that belonged to Munch. Both mock-ups had a similar composition to the lake in the painting. \"Our goal was to compare the data from all these different pigments, in order to extrapolate the causes that can lead to deterioration,\" says Monico.\n\nThe study shows that the original cadmium sulfide turns into cadmium sulfate in the presence of chloride-compounds in high-moisture conditions (relative humidity, or RH ?95%). This happens even if there is no light.\n\n\"The right formula to preserve and display the main version of The Scream on a permanent basis should include the mitigation of the degradation of the cadmium yellow pigment by minimising the exposure of the painting to excessively high moisture levels (trying to reach 45% RH or lower), while keeping the lighting at standard values foreseen for lightfast painting materials. The results of this study provide new knowledge, which may lead to practical adjustments to the Museum's conservation strategy,\" explains Irina C. A. Sandu, conservation scientist at the Munch Museum.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Today the Munch Museum stores and exhibits Edvard Munch's artworks at a relative humidity of about 50% and at a temperature of around 20 \u00b0C. These environmental conditions will also apply to the new Munch Museum to be opened in Spring 2020. That said, the Museum will now look into how this study may affect the current regime. Part of such a review will be to consider how other materials in the collection will respond to possible adjustments,\" adds Eva Storevik Tveit, paintings conservator at the Munch Museum.\n\nCadmium-sulfide-based yellows are not only present in Munch's artwork but also in the work of other artists contemporary to him, such as Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh and James Ensor.\n\n\"The integration of non-invasive in-situ investigations at the macro-scale level with synchrotron micro-analyses proved its worth in helping us to understand complex alteration processes. It can be profitably exploited for interrogating masterpieces that could suffer from the same weakness,\" reports Costanza Miliani, coordinator of the mobile platform MOLAB (operating in Europe under the IPERION CH project) and second corresponding author of this study.\n\nMonico and colleagues, especially Koen Janssens (University of Antwerp), have a long-standing collaboration with the ESRF, the European Synchrotron, and in particular with the scientist Marine Cotte, to investigate these pigments and the best way to preserve the original masterpieces.\n\n\"At the ESRF, ID21 is one of the very few beamlines in the world where we can perform imaging X-ray absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of the entire sample, at low energy and with sub-micrometer spatial resolution,\" explains Janssens.\n\n\"EBS, the new Extremely Brilliant Source, the first-of-a-kind high-energy synchrotron, which is under commissioning at the moment at the ESRF, will further improve the capabilities of our instruments for the benefit of world heritage science. We will be able to perform microanalyses with increased sensitivity, and a greater level of detail. Considering the complexity of these artistic materials, such instrumental developments will highly benefit the analysis of our cultural heritage,\" adds Cotte, ESRF scientist and CNRS researcher director.\n\n\"This kind of work shows that art and science are intrinsically linked and that science can help preserve pieces of art so that the world can continue admiring them for years to come,\" concludes Miliani, coordinator of MOLAB.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515135407.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:54:07", "title": "COVID-19 infection control, radiographer protection in CT exam areas", "text": "In an open-access article published ahead-of-print by the American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR), a team of Chinese radiologists discussed modifications to the CT examination process and strict disinfection of examination rooms, while outlining personal protection measures for radiographers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\nAs Jieming Qu, Wenjie Yang, and colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School Affiliated Ruijin Hospital noted, to undergo CT, patients must exit the fever clinic and proceed to an examination room elsewhere at the institution.

A safe infection control strategy for examination of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 was also implemented, including reconstructing the area and planning the path a patient would take.

For many years, the lack of shellfish in some layers at these sites puzzled archaeologists. In spite of apparently living near the ocean, the inhabitants hunted mostly big game -- the sort of animals that typically live farther inland.\n\nScientists knew a submerged landscape existed on the continental shelf just offshore, but it wasn't until recently, perhaps inspired by rising sea levels of our current human-caused global warming, they realized these caves might have made up the westernmost edge of a long-lost plain.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDuring most of the Pleistocene, the geological era before the one we live in now, these caves were not located on the coast. With so much of the Earth's water locked up in continent-sized glaciers, sea level was much lower, and humans could have thrived between the cliffs and a gentler coastline miles and miles to the east.\n\nA special issue of Quaternary Science Reviews presents papers using a wide range of techniques to reconstruct the environment and ecology of the Paleo-Agulhas Plain. They reveal a verdant world rich with game, plant, and coastal resources, periodically cut off from the mainland during warm spells between glacial periods when sea level rose to levels similar to those of today, which would have played an important role in human evolution.\n\nFranklin and her colleagues used modern vegetation patterns along the Cape south coast to develop models of the expected vegetation for the various soil types, as well as the climate (especially rainfall) and fire regimes of the past glacial periods that framed most of the timeframe in which modern humans emerged.\n\nJoining her in the research were Richard M. Cowling and Alastair J. Potts of Nelson Mandela University; Guy F. Midgley at Stellenbosch University; Francois Engelbrecht of the University of Witwatersrand; and Curtis W. Marean of Arizona State University.\n\nVegetation was reconstructed based on a model of the ancient climate and fire patterns of these glacial phases that define human evolution. The group developed the vegetation model based on present-day patterns and environmental conditions, compared their model to an independently derived vegetation map to validate it, then applied it to the climate, landforms, and soils reconstructed for the peak of the last ice age on the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain.\n\nReconstruction, mapping, and modeling of the paleo-climate, geology, and soils by their collaborators are featured in other articles in the special issue.\n\nThe model found the paleo-landscape exposed during glacial low-sea levels added a land area the size of Ireland to the southern tip of Africa. Near the coast, it was dominated by \"limestone fynbos,\" a low-stature, but species-rich shrubland typical of contemporary South Africa's Cape Floristic Province, a global plant diversity hotspot. The northern plains were mostly grasslands in shallow floodplains and on shale bedrock.\n\nThis savanna-like vegetation is rare in the modern landscape and would have supported the megafauna typical of glacial periods. These game animals, found in the archaeological record, include a great diversity of grazing animals, including the now-extinct giant Cape Buffalo, and others of which no longer occur naturally in this part of Africa, such as giraffes.\n\nThe Paleo-Agulhas plain had extremely high plant species diversity, as well as a greater variety of ecosystems and plant communities than currently found in this region, including shale grassland with dune fynbos-thicket mosaic on uplands and broad and shallow floodplains supporting a mosaic of woodland and grassland on fertile, alluvial soils.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131915.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:15", "title": "The dreaming brain tunes out the outside world", "text": "Scientists from the CNRS and the ENS-PSL in France and Monash University in Australia have shown that the brain suppresses information from the outside world, such as the sound of a conversation, during the sleep phase linked to dreaming. This ability could be one of the protective mechanisms of dreams. The study, carried out in collaboration with the Centre du Sommeil et de la Vigilance, H\u00f4tel-Dieu, AP-HP -- Universit\u00e9 de Paris, is published in Current Biology on 14 May 2020.\n\nWhile we dream, we invent worlds that bear no relation to the quietness of our bedroom. In fact, it is rather unusual for elements of our immediate environment to be incorporated into our dreams. To better understand how the brain protects itself from outside influences, researchers invited 18 participants to a morning nap in the lab. Morning sleep is rich in dreams. Dreams mostly occur during what is known as REM sleep, since the brain is somehow in a waking state during this phase of sleep, showing brain activity similar to that when a person is awake. The body, on the other hand, is paralysed, although not entirely. During certain phases of REM sleep, the eyes continue to move. Research has shown that such movements are related to dreaming.\n\nTo study how the dreaming brain interacts with external sounds, the scientists got volunteer sleepers to listen to stories in French mixed with meaningless language. By combining the electroencephalogram with a machine learning technique, they confirmed that, even when the brain is asleep, it continues to record everything that goes on around it. They also showed that, during light sleep, the brain prioritises meaningful speech, just as it does when in the waking state. However, such speech is actively filtered out during eye movement phases in REM sleep. In other words, our sleeping brain can select information from the outside world and flexibly amplify or suppress it, depending on whether or not it is immersed in a dream!\n\nThe team believe that this mechanism enables the brain to protect the dreaming phase, which is necessary for emotional balance and consolidation of the day's learning. Although dreams are predominant during periods of eye movement, they can also occur during other phases of sleep. Are they then accompanied by a similar suppression of sensations from the outside world?", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131911.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:11", "title": "Scientists break the link between a quantum material's spin and orbital states", "text": "In designing electronic devices, scientists look for ways to manipulate and control three basic properties of electrons: their charge; their spin states, which give rise to magnetism; and the shapes of the fuzzy clouds they form around the nuclei of atoms, which are known as orbitals.\n\nUntil now, electron spins and orbitals were thought to go hand in hand in a class of materials that's the cornerstone of modern information technology; you couldn't quickly change one without changing the other. But a study at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory shows that a pulse of laser light can dramatically change the spin state of one important class of materials while leaving its orbital state intact.\n\nThe results suggest a new path for making a future generation of logic and memory devices based on \"orbitronics,\" said Lingjia Shen, a SLAC research associate and one of the lead researchers for the study.\n\n\"What we're seeing in this system is the complete opposite of what people have seen in the past,\" Shen said. \"It raises the possibility that we could control a material's spin and orbital states separately, and use variations in the shapes of orbitals as the 0s and 1s needed to make computations and store information in computer memories.\"\n\nThe international research team, led by Joshua Turner, a SLAC staff scientist and investigator with the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Science (SIMES), reported their results this week in Physical Review B Rapid Communications.\n\nAn intriguing, complex material\n\nThe material the team studied was a manganese oxide-based quantum material known as NSMO, which comes in extremely thin crystalline layers. It's been around for three decades and is used in devices where information is stored by using a magnetic field to switch from one electron spin state to another, a method known as spintronics. NSMO is also considered a promising candidate for making future computers and memory storage devices based on skyrmions, tiny particle-like vortexes created by the magnetic fields of spinning electrons.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut this material is also very complex, said Yoshinori Tokura, director of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan, who was also involved in the study.\n\n\"Unlike semiconductors and other familiar materials, NSMO is a quantum material whose electrons behave in a cooperative, or correlated, manner, rather than independently as they usually do,\" he said. \"This makes it hard to control one aspect of the electrons' behavior without affecting all the others.\"\n\nOne common way to investigate this type of material is to hit it with laser light to see how its electronic states respond to an injection of energy. That's what the research team did here. They observed the material's response with X-ray laser pulses from SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).\n\nOne melts, the other doesn't\n\nWhat they expected to see was that orderly patterns of electron spins and orbitals in the material would be thrown into total disarray, or \"melted,\" as they absorbed pulses of near-infrared laser light.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut to their surprise, only the spin patterns melted, while the orbital patterns stayed intact, Turner said. The normal coupling between the spin and orbital states had been completely broken, he said, which is a challenging thing to do in this type of correlated material and had not been observed before.\n\nTokura said, \"Usually only a tiny application of photoexcitation destroys everything. Here, they were able to keep the electron state that is most important for future devices -- the orbital state -- undamaged. This is a nice new addition to the science of orbitronics and correlated electrons.\"\n\nMuch as electron spin states are switched in spintronics, electron orbital states could be switched to provide a similar function. These orbitronic devices could, in theory, operate 10,000 faster than spintronic devices, Shen said.\n\nSwitching between two orbital states could be made possible by using short bursts of terahertz radiation, rather than the magnetic fields used today, he said: \"Combining the two could achieve much better device performance for future applications.\" The team is working on ways to do that.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131909.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:09", "title": "Blood clotting abnormalities reveal COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events", "text": "When researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, used a combination of two specific blood-clotting tests, they found critically ill patients infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were at high risk for developing renal failure, venous blood clots, and other complications associated with blood clots, such as stroke. Their study, which was one of the first to build on growing evidence that COVID-19-infected patients are highly predisposed to developing blood clots, linked blood clotting measurements with actual patient outcomes. The research team is now participating in a randomized clinical trial of a drug that breaks down blood clots in COVID-19-infected patients.\n\n\"This is an early step on the road to discovering treatments to prevent some of the complications that come with this disease,\" said Franklin Wright, MD, FACS, lead author of the research article and an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nTheir research is published as an \"article in press\" on the Journal of the American College of Surgeons website ahead of print.\n\nPatients who are critically ill regardless of cause can develop a condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The blood of these patients initially forms many clots in small blood vessels. The body's natural clotting factors can form too much clot or eventually not be able to effectively form any clot leading to issues of both excessive clotting and excessive bleeding. However, in patients with COVID-19 the clotting appears to be particularly severe and -- as evidenced by case studies in China and elsewhere -- clots in COVID-19 patients do not appear to dissipate, explained Dr. Wright.\n\nTrauma acute care surgeons and intensive care physicians who treat trauma, transplant, and cardiothoracic surgery patients at UC Health University of Colorado Hospital saw the potential of using a specialized coagulation test to examine clotting issues in COVID-19 patients. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a whole blood assay that provides a broad picture of how an individual patient's blood forms clots, including how long clotting takes, how strong clots are, and how soon clots break down. TEG is highly specialized and used primarily by surgeons and anesthesiologists to evaluate the efficiency of blood clotting; it is not widely used in other clinical settings. \"The COVID pandemic is opening doors for multidisciplinary collaboration so trauma acute care surgeons and intensivists can bring the tools they use in their day-to-day lives and apply them in the critical care setting to new problems,\" Dr. Wright said.\n\nThe researchers evaluated outcomes for all patients who had a TEG assay as part of their treatment for COVID-19 infection as well as other conventional coagulation assays, including ones that measure D-dimer levels. D-dimer is a protein fragment that is produced when a blood clot dissolves. D-dimer levels are elevated when large numbers of clots are breaking down.\n\nA total of 44 patients treated for COVID-19 infection between March 22 and April 20 were included in the analysis. Those whose bodies were not breaking down clots most often required hemodialysis and had a higher rate of clots in the veins. These patients were identified by TEG assays showing no clot breakdown after 30 minutes and a D-dimer level greater than 2600 ng/mL. Eighty percent of patients with both affirmative test findings were placed on dialysis compared with 14 percent who tested for neither finding. Patients with affirmative test findings also had a 50 percent rate of venous blood clots compared with 0 percent for those patients with neither finding.\n\n\"These study results suggest there may be a benefit to early TEG testing in institutions that have the technology to identify COVID-19 patients who may need more aggressive anticoagulation therapy to prevent complications from clot formation,\" Dr. Wright said.\n\nA clinical trial of one form of treatment is already underway. The Denver Health and Hospital Authority is leading a multi-center study that includes UC Health University of Colorado Hospital, National Jewish Health-St Joseph Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Long Island Jewish Hospital in conjunction with Genentech, Inc., enrolling patients with COVID-19 infection in a randomized clinical trial of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This drug is a natural anticoagulant that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1996 for the treatment of diseases associated with clotting disorders, such as heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The trial will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous tPA in improving respiratory function and management of patients with aggressive blood clotting.\n\n\"This study suggests that testing whole blood clotting measurements may allow physicians to identify and treat patients with COVID-19 more effectively to prevent complications and encourage further research into therapies to prevent blood clots in these patients,\" Dr. Wright said.\n\nDr. Wright's associates in this study include: Thomas O.

The effect of shrubs is so powerful that it even counterbalances the lower annual rainfall amounts expected during climate change.\n\nUntil now, researchers have thought that woody plants like trees and shrubs have deeper roots than grass. This belief stemmed from scientists performing their related studies on flat ground.\n\n\"It is striking that ecosystem composition is what controls projected future changes to groundwater recharge,\" Schreiner-McGraw said. \"This does not mean that climate change is not important, but that vegetation change is potentially more important and something that scientists and land managers should focus more effort on understanding.\"\n\nCo-author Hoori Ajami, an assistant professor of groundwater hydrology at UC Riverside, said the paper looks at the combined effects of climate and vegetation change on groundwater-recharge processes in arid environments.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Most studies to date have looked at these changes in isolation,\" Ajami said. \"Here we illustrate that the combined effects of vegetation change and climate change could be greater or less than the sum of its parts.\"\n\nThe intrusion of shrubs into grasslands is often considered a problem because it reduces the amount of forage available for livestock grazing and can lead to more bare ground patches and subsequent increase in soil erosion. This process of creating more bare ground is called \"xerification.\" Climate change contributes to xerification, but fire suppression and overgrazing play the biggest roles.\n\nIt makes sense that shrubs, which have deep root systems along with thick stems and many leaves, capture more water than grass does as it percolates down through the soil, leaving less available water to replenish the underground aquifers. Research on \"diffuse recharge,\" the process by which water replenishes groundwater supplies over a large area, seems to bear this out for flat landscapes. Xerification of grasslands has thus been viewed as bad for both livestock and the water cycle.\n\n\"We approached this research with a simple premise that topography plays a role in redistributing available water, and this should affect the outcomes of xerification,\" said co-author Enrique R. Vivoni, a professor at Arizona State University.\n\nThe group looked at focused recharge, which occurs when hillslopes funnel water into concentrated areas, such as streambeds. Streambeds often have sandy bottoms, which allow water to quickly infiltrate and prevent the deep-rooted shrubs from sucking it up.\n\nadvertisement\n\nData from a highly monitored desert mountain slope in New Mexico was used to simulate the effects of woody plant encroachment and climate change on water resources. The team discovered that not only did the shrubs increase focused groundwater recharge, but that they did so even under conditions where climate change reduced the amount of rainfall.\n\nThey also modeled a more extensive form of shrub encroachment called thicketization, in which plants grow in dense stands with no bare patches, and found, as in prior flat landscape research, the shrubs reduced the amount of groundwater recharge on slopes as well.\n\nOn hillslopes, bare soil in between patches of shrubs is necessary to drive water into streambeds. Increased runoff increases focused groundwater recharge.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that a transition from grassland to shrubland can increase sustainability of groundwater aquifers,\" said Schreiner-McGraw. \"The best way to increase focused recharge in this system is to increase the amount of runoff from hillslopes that gets concentrated in the streambeds.\"\n\nClimate change will most likely increase groundwater recharge by making rainstorms larger, but less frequent. Larger storms increase the amount of runoff that reaches sandy-bottom channels and increases groundwater recharge. Findings from this study suggest vegetation will also play an important part in groundwater recharge in the future.\n\nThough the study took place in New Mexico, Schreiner-McGraw said it applies to similar environments. Large parts of California are also desert savannahs. Southern California and the Central Valley have landforms similar to those found in the New Mexico study site. These areas could experience similar hydrological processes, though atmospheric rivers create storms very different from monsoon storms, so more research is required.\n\n\"The study highlights the role of long-term monitoring in understanding water balance dynamics of watersheds, and the role that process-based modeling plays in understanding system dynamics,\" Ajami said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515115654.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T16:56:54", "title": "Eavesdropping on single molecules with light by replaying the chatter", "text": "Scientists have pioneered a new technique to expose hidden biochemical pathways involving single molecules at the nanoscale.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Exeter's Living Systems Institute used light to establish a means to monitor the structure and properties of individual molecules in real time.\n\nThis innovative approach has allowed the team to temporarily bridge molecules together to provide a crucial lens into their dynamics.\n\nThe study is published in the leading journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe structure of individual molecules and their properties, such as chirality, are difficult to probe.\n\nIn the new study, led by Professor Frank Vollmer, the group was able to observe reactions at the nanoscale which would otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThiol/disulfide exchange -- or the principal way disulfide bonds are formed and rearranged in a protein -- has not yet been fully scrutinised at equilibrium at the single-molecule level, in part because this cannot be optically resolved in bulk samples.\n\nHowever, light can circulate around micron-sized glass spheres to form resonances.

Co-authors on the paper include Don Gruenbacher, associate professor and department head of electrical and computer engineering; Jessica Heier Stamm, associate professor of industrial and manufacturing systems engineering; Gary Brase, professor of psychological sciences; Scott DeLoach, professor and department head of computer science; and David Amrine, research director of the Beef Cattle Institute.\n\nThe researchers used the model to evaluate which supply chain components were more robust and which were not. They determined that packing plants are the most vulnerable. Scoglio said that recent events in the middle of the COVID-19 pandemic raise important issues about how to safeguard the system.\n\n\"An important message is that after understanding the critical role of these packers, we need to decide how we could protect both them and the people who work there,\" Scoglio said. \"While the plants are a critical infrastructure and need to be protected, taking care of the health of the workers is very important. How can we design a production process that can be flexible and adaptable in an epidemic?\"\n\nAccording to the paper, the beef cattle industry contributes approximately $8.9 billion to the Kansas economy and employs more than 42,000 people in the state. Since trucks are needed to move cattle, any disruption in either cattle production or transportation almost certainly would harm the regional economy, Scoglio said.\n\n\"Packers need to be considered as a critical point of a much longer supply chain, which needs specific attention to make sure it will not fail and can continue working,\" Scoglio said. \"Beef packers are a critical infrastructure in the United States.\"\n\nThe project was supported by the National Science Foundation and focused on southwest Kansas, but the researchers acknowledge that cattle come from outside the region and interruptions may have larger national effects.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515115646.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T16:56:46", "title": "Global cooling event 4,200 years ago spurred rice's evolution, spread across Asia: Scientists use genomics, archeology, and climate data to reconstruct history of rice", "text": "A major global cooling event that occurred 4,200 years ago may have led to the evolution of new rice varieties and the spread of rice into both northern and southern Asia, an international team of researchers has found.\n\nTheir study, published in Nature Plants and led by the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology, uses a multidisciplinary approach to reconstruct the history of rice and trace its migration throughout Asia.\n\nRice is one of the most important crops worldwide, a staple for more than half of the global population. It was first cultivated 9,000 years ago in the Yangtze Valley in China and later spread across East, Southeast, and South Asia, followed by the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. In the process, rice evolved and adapted to different environments, but little is known about the routes, timing, and environmental forces involved in this spread.\n\nIn their study, the researchers reconstructed the historical movement of rice across Asia using whole-genome sequences of more than 1,400 varieties of rice -- including varieties of japonica and indica, two main subspecies of Asian rice -- coupled with geography, archaeology, and historical climate data.\n\nFor the first 4,000 years of its history, farming rice was largely confined to China, and japonica was the subspecies grown. Then, a global cooling event 4,200 years ago -- also known as the 4.2k event, which is thought to have had widespread consequences, including the collapse of civilizations from Mesopotamia to China -- coincided with japonica rice diversifying into temperate and tropical varieties. The newly evolved temperate varieties spread in northern China, Korea and Japan, while the tropical varieties and spread to Southeast Asia.\n\n\"This abrupt climate change forced plants, including crops, to adapt,\" said Rafal M. Gutaker, a postdoctoral associate at the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology and the study's lead author. \"Our genomic data, as well as paleoclimate modeling by our collaborators, show that the cooling event occurred at the same time as the rise of temperate japonica, which grows in milder regions. This cooling event also may have led to the migration of rice agriculture and farmer communities into Southeast Asia.\"\n\n\"These findings were then backed up by data from archaeological rice remains excavated in Asia, which also showed that after the 4.2k event, tropical rice migrated south while rice also adapted to northern latitudes as temperate varieties,\" said Michael D. Purugganan, the Silver Professor of Biology at NYU, who led the study.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter the global cooling event, tropical japonica rice continued to diversify. It reached islands in Southeast Asia about 2,500 years ago, likely due to extensive trade networks and the movement of goods and peoples in the region -- a finding also supported by archeological data.\n\nThe spread of indica rice was more recent and more complicated; after originating in India's lower Ganges Valley roughly 4,000 years ago, the researchers traced its migration from India into China approximately 2,000 years ago.\n\nWhile the researchers had thought that rainfall and water would be the most limiting environmental factor in rice diversity, they found temperature to be the key factor instead. Their analyses revealed that heat accumulation and temperature were very strongly associated with the genomic differences between tropical and temperate japonica rice varieties.\n\n\"This study illustrates the value of multidisciplinary research. Our genomic data gave us a model for where and when rice spread to different parts of Asia, archaeology told us when and where rice showed up at various places, and the environmental and climate modeling gave us the ecological context,\" said Purugganan. \"Together, this approach allows us to write a first draft of the story of how rice dispersed across Asia.\"\n\nUnderstanding the spread of rice and the related environmental pressures could also help scientists develop new varieties that meet future environmental challenges, such as climate change and drought -- which could help address looming food security issues.\n\n\"Armed with knowledge of the pattern of rice dispersal and environmental factors that influenced its migration, we can examine the evolutionary adaptations of rice as it spread to new environments, which could allow us to identify traits and genes to help future breeding efforts,\" said Gutaker.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515115644.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T16:56:44", "title": "Heart attacks, heart failure, stroke: COVID-19's dangerous cardiovascular complications: ER doctors highlight underappreciated risks, potential drug interactions", "text": "COVID-19 can cause serious cardiovascular complications including heart failure, heart attacks and blood clots that can lead to strokes, emergency medicine doctors report in a new scientific paper. They also caution that COVID-19 treatments can interact with medicines used to manage patients' existing cardiovascular conditions.\n\nThe new paper from UVA Health's William Brady, MD, and colleagues aims to serve as a guide for emergency-medicine doctors treating patients who may have or are known to have COVID-19. The authors note that much attention has been paid to the pulmonary (breathing) complications of COVID-19, but less has been said about the cardiovascular complications that can lead to death or lasting impairment.\n\n\"In writing this article, we hope to increase emergency physicians' knowledge and awareness of this new pathogen and its impact on the cardiovascular system,\" said Brady, of UVA's Department of Emergency Medicine. \"As we encounter more and more patients with COVID-19-related illness, we are increasing our understanding of its impact on the body in general and the cardiovascular system in particular. The rate of learning on this area is amazingly rapid. Information continues to change weekly, if not daily.\"\n\nCOVID-19 and Heart Failure\n\nHeart failure is a particular concern in patients with COVID-19. One study, the article authors note, found that almost a quarter of COVID-19 patients -- 24% -- were suffering acute heart failure when they were first diagnosed with the coronavirus. (This doesn't mean that 24% of all COVID-19 patients will suffer heart failure. The authors state that it remains unclear if the heart failure was the result of COVID-19 specifically or if the virus was worsening undiagnosed heart failure.)\n\nOf the patients with heart failure, nearly half were not known to have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease.\n\nStrokes and Other Concerns\n\nThe paper also notes that COVID-19, and other diseases that cause severe inflammation throughout the body, increase the risk that fatty plaque built up in the blood vessels will rupture, leading to heart attacks and stroke. Influenza and certain other viruses have been associated with increased risk of plaque ruptures within the first week after the disease was diagnosed, the authors state in their review of the available COVID-19 medical literature.\n\nFinally, the authors describe potential drug interactions in COVID-19 patients. For example, the highly publicized malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can interact with medications designed to regulate heart rhythm, in addition to causing heart damage and worsening cardiomyopathy. Remdesivir, an antiviral that is the only COVID-19 treatment authorized by the FDA, can cause low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm. It's important for doctors to bear these interactions in mind when treating patients with COVID-19, the authors note.\n\n\"As we gain more experience with this new pathogen, we realize that its adverse impact extends beyond the respiratory system,\" Brady said. \"We will continue to learn more about COVID-19 and the most optimal means of managing its many presentations.\"\n\nFindings Published\n\nThe article has been published online by the American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

It also reduced blood levels of interleukin(IL)-6 and C-reactive protein (CRP), two inflammatory proteins found in COVID-19 patients.\n\nDr. Fish says that the research team considered IFN-\u03b1 therapy for COVID-19 after they demonstrated interferon provided therapeutic benefit during the SARS outbreak of 2002 and 2003.\n\n\"Rather than developing a virus-specific antiviral for each new virus outbreak, I would argue that we should consider interferons as the 'first responders' in terms of treatment,\" says Dr. Fish.\n\n\"Interferons have been approved for clinical use for many years, so the strategy would be to 'repurpose' them for severe acute virus infections.\"\n\nBoosting a natural defense mechanism\n\nadvertisement\n\nInterferons are a group of signaling proteins released by the human body in response to all viruses. As Dr. Fish explains, they are a \"first line of defense.\"\n\nThey target different stages of a virus's life cycle, inhibiting them from multiplying. They also boost an immune response by activating different immune cells to clear an infection. Some viruses, however, can block this natural defense mechanism.\n\n\"But it is possible to override this block. If a virus blocks interferon production, then treating with interferon can offset this.\"\n\nStudy details\n\nThe researchers conducted this exploratory study on a group of 77 patients with COVID-19 in Wuhan, China. These patients were admitted to Union Hospital, Tongii Medical College, between January 16 and February 20, 2020. They represented moderate cases of the disease as none of the patients required intensive care or prolonged oxygen supplementation or intubation.\n\nDespite the study's limitations of a small, non-randomized group of patients, the work provides several important and novel insights into COVID-19 disease, notably that treatment with IFN-\u03b12b can accelerate viral clearance from the upper respiratory tract and also reduce circulating levels of inflammatory factors that are associated with severe COVID-19.\n\nDr. Fish says a randomized clinical trial is a crucial next step. According to her, a clinical trial with a larger group of infected patients who are randomized to treatment or placebo would further this research.\n\nIn the meantime, the findings from this study are the first to suggest therapeutic efficacy of IFN-\u03b12b as an available antiviral intervention for COVID-19, which may also benefit public health measures by shortening the duration of viral clearance and therefore slowing the tide of the pandemic.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515103923.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T15:39:23", "title": "Innovative virus research may save wheat and other crops", "text": "UC Riverside scientists have solved a 20-year-old genetics puzzle that could result in ways to protect wheat, barley, and other crops from a devastating infection.\n\nAyala Rao, professor of plant pathology and microbiology, has been studying Brome Mosaic virus for decades.

The proteins perform different tasks, some of which cause stunted growth, lesions, and ultimately death of infected host plants.\n\nTwo decades ago, scientists used the average of all three particles to create a basic description of their structure. In order to differentiate them, Rao first needed to separate them, and get them into their most pure form.\n\nadvertisement\n\nUsing a genetic engineering technique, Rao's team disabled the pathogenic aspects of the virus and infused the viral genes with a host plant.\n\n\"This bacterium inserts its genome into the plant's cells, similar to the way HIV inserts itself into human cells,\" Rao said. \"We were then able to isolate the viral particles in the plants and determine their structure using electron microscopes and computer-based technology.\"\n\nNow that one of the particles is fully mapped, it's clear the first two particles are more stable than the third.\n\n\"Once we alter the stability, we can manipulate how RNA gets released into the plants,\" Rao said. \"We can make the third particle more stable, so it doesn't release RNA and the infection gets delayed.\"\n\nThis work was made possible by a grant from the University of California Multicampus Research Program and Initiatives.

They also argue the first-of-its-kind investigation could provide important input to employment policy, especially as global governments scramble to prop up ailing economies.\n\n\"It has long been acknowledged that the entry and growth of new firms contribute a large share of job creation in most countries. Social venture start-ups, however, are mostly celebrated for their worth in helping the disadvantaged or solving social concerns -- their role in job creation has not really been considered,\" said Professor Obschonka.\n\n\"Yet using an established method for tracking direct and indirect job creation effects across 67 regions in Sweden over an eight-year period from start-up entry into the marketplace, our findings show the average job creation effect per firm was larger for social start-ups than for their commercial counterparts.\n\n\"Job creation is often a major focus of the social mission of these start-ups, especially for marginalised groups including people with disabilities and long-term unemployed individuals.\"\n\nProfessor Davidsson said the findings were contrary to the reliance on volunteers by many social endeavours.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"There appear to be a number of reasons social ventures create more jobs.

So even the high growth firms among the commercial category do not raise the average to high levels; partly because they outcompete or acquire some of their peers.\n\n\"By contrast, social ventures address underserved 'markets' of social problems, such as homelessness, substance abuse, domestic violence, refugees, environmental concerns, animal shelters, foodbanks, crisis centres, youth unemployment and so on.\n\n\"This creates room for growth without pushing out other social ventures.

Following the encouraging decline in the number of new cases of COVID-19, the debate on the effectiveness of interventions taken to date and on further relaxation of the restrictions is meanwhile gaining momentum.\n\nResearchers from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPIDS) and the University of G\u00f6ttingen have now succeeded in analyzing the German COVID-19 case numbers with respect to past containment measures and deriving scenarios for the coming weeks. Their computer models could also provide insights into the effectiveness of interventions in other countries. Their results have been published today online in the journal Science.\n\nSimulations since mid-March\n\nMany people are currently concerned about how well the measures to contain the pandemic have worked in recent weeks and how things will continue in the coming weeks. Scientists at the MPIDS have been investigating these questions. The team has been simulating the course of the coronavirus epidemic in Germany together with scientists from the G\u00f6ttingen Campus since mid-March. In their model calculations, the researchers relate the gradually increasing restrictions of public life in March to the development of COVID-19 case numbers. In particular, they examined the effect of the three packages of interventions in March: the cancellation of major public events around March 8, the closure of educational institutions and many shops on March 16, and the extensive contact ban on March 22. To this end, the researchers combined data on the temporal course of the COVID-19 new infections with an epidemiological dynamics model that allows the analysis of the course of the pandemic to date and the investigation of scenarios for the future. According to the computer models, the packages of measures initially slowed down the spread of COVID-19 and finally broke the dreaded exponential growth.\n\n\"Our analysis clearly shows the effect of the various interventions, which together ultimately brought about a strong trend reversal,\" says Viola Priesemann, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute. Michael Wilczek, research group leader and co-author of the study, adds: \"Our model calculations thus show us the overall effect of the change in people's behavior that goes hand in hand with the interventions.\"\n\nA computer model also for other countries and regions\n\nIn their work, the G\u00f6ttingen researchers did not only have Germany in mind. \"From the very beginning, we designed our computer model so that it could be transferred to other countries and regions. Our analysis tools are freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast) and are already being used and developed further by researchers around the world,\" says Jonas Dehning, lead author of the study. The G\u00f6ttingen research team is currently working on applying the model to European countries. It is particularly important to work out the different points in time at which the measures were taken in different countries, which could allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the individual measures.\n\nConcerns about the second wave\n\nThe G\u00f6ttingen researchers' analysis of Germany on the basis of case numbers up to April 21 indicated an overall positive development of case numbers for the coming weeks. However, their analysis also reveals a central challenge in assessing the epidemic dynamics: changes in the spread of the coronavirus are only reflected in the COVID-19 case numbers with considerable delays. \"We have only recently seen the first effects of the relaxation of restrictions of April 20 in the case numbers. And until we can evaluate the relaxations of May 11, we also have to wait two to three weeks,\" says Michael Wilczek. The researchers are therefore continuing to monitor the situation very closely. Every day they evaluate the new case numbers to assess whether a second wave is to be expected.\n\nUsing three different model scenarios, the G\u00f6ttingen team also shows how the number of new cases might develop further. If the relaxations of May 11 doubles the infection rate, a second wave can be expected. Instead, if the infection rate balances the recovery rate, the new infections stay approximately constant. However, it is also possible that the number of new infections will continue to decrease, says Viola Priesemann: \"If everyone continues to be very careful and contact tracing by the health authorities is effective, and at the same time all new outbreaks of infection are detected and contained early, then the number of cases can continue to decrease. How exactly the numbers will develop in the future, therefore, depends decisively on our behavior, the observance of distance recommendations and hygiene measures,\" says the G\u00f6ttingen physicist.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515103912.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T15:39:12", "title": "Pine martens like to have neighbors -- but not too near", "text": "Pine martens need neighbours but like to keep their distance, according to new research.\n\nOver three years, the cat-like predators were caught in Scotland and moved to mid-Wales by Vincent Wildlife Trust.\n\nBy attaching miniaturised radio-transmitter collars to 39 of the released animals, a tracking team followed them for a year as they explored their new home in Welsh forests.\n\nThe research, published today in the journal Ecology and Evolution, was carried out by Dr Cat McNicol from the Environment and Sustainability Institute of the University of Exeter with staff from Vincent Wildlife Trust.\n\nDr McNicol's analyses have shown that the pine martens spent some time exploring their new habitats before settling into solitary territories, but that having pine marten neighbours helped them settle more quickly.\n\nIn the first release, when there were no other pine martens nearby, the new arrivals roamed long distances over two weeks before settling into their chosen territory -- often close to the point where they were released.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe following year, when more pine martens were released in the same area, the new cohort established territories within a week, but further away from the release point.\n\nDr McNicol said \"Although they defend solitary territories vigorously, pine martens depend on their neighbours when deciding where to set up home.

Yet, both efforts are surrounded by unresolved uncertainty whether the immune system can mount a substantial and lasting response to SARS-CoV-2 and whether exposure to circulating common cold coronaviruses provides any kind of protective immunity.\n\nA collaboration between the labs of Alessandro Sette, Dr. Biol. Sci. and Shane Crotty, Ph.D., at La Jolla Institute for Immunology is starting to fill in the massive knowledge gap with good news for vaccine developers and is providing the first cellular immunology data to help guide social distancing recommendations.\n\nPublished in today's online edition of Cell, the study documents a robust antiviral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a group of 20 adults who had recovered from COVID-19. The findings show that the body's immune system is able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 in many ways, dispelling fears that the virus may elude ongoing efforts to create an effective vaccine.\n\n\"If we had seen only marginal immune responses, we would have been concerned,\" says Sette, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research, and adds, \"but what we see is a very robust T cell response against the spike protein, which is the target of most ongoing COVID-19 efforts, as well as other viral proteins. These findings are really good news for vaccine development.\"\n\n\"All efforts to predict the best vaccine candidates and fine-tune pandemic control measures hinge on understanding the immune response to the virus,\" says Crotty, also a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research. \"People were really worried that COVID-19 doesn't induce immunity, and reports about people getting re-infected reinforced these concerns, but knowing now that the average person makes a solid immune response should largely put those concerns to rest.\"\n\nIn an earlier study, Sette and his team had used bioinformatics tools to predict which fragments of SARS-CoV-2 are capable of activating human T cells. The scientists then, in this newest research, tested whether T cells isolated from adults who had recovered from COVID-19 without major problems, recognized the predicted protein fragments, or so-called peptides, from the virus itself. The scientists pooled the peptides into two big groups: The first so-called mega-pool included peptides covering all proteins in the viral genome apart from SARS-CoV-2's \"spike\" protein. The second mega-pool specifically focused on the spike protein that dots the surface of the virus, since almost all of the vaccines under development right now target this coronavirus spike protein.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We specifically chose to study people who had a normal disease course and didn't require hospitalization to provide a solid benchmark for what a normal immune response looks like, since the virus can do some very unusual things in some people,\" says Sette.\n\nThe researchers found that all COVID-19 patients had a solid CD4, or \"helper,\" T cell response, which helps antibody production. Almost all patients had produced virus-specific CD8, or \"killer,\" T cells, which eliminate virus-infected cells. \"Our data show that the virus induces what you would expect from a typical, successful antiviral response,\" says Crotty.\n\nAnd, although these results don't preclude that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may be detrimental, they provide an important baseline against which individuals' immune responses can be compared; or, as Sette likes to put it, \"if you can get a picture of something, you can discuss whether you like it or not but if there's no picture there's nothing to discuss.\"\n\n\"We have a solid starting foundation to now ask whether there's a difference in the type of immune response in people who have severe outcomes and require hospitalization versus people who can recover at home or are even asymptomatic,\" adds Sette. \"But not only that, we now have an important tool to determine whether the immune response in people who have received an experimental vaccine resembles what you would expect to see in a protective immune response to COVID-19, as opposed to an insufficient or detrimental response.\"\n\nThe teams also looked at the T cell response in blood samples that had been collected between 2015 and 2018, before SARS-CoV-2 started circulating. Many of these individuals had significant T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, although they had never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. But everybody has almost certainly seen at least three of the four common cold coronaviruses, which could explain the observed crossreactivity.\n\nIt is still unclear, though, whether the observed crossreactivity provides at least some level of preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore could explain why some people or geographical locations are hit harder by COVID-19.\n\n\u00ac\u00ac\"Given the severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, any degree of cross-reactive coronavirus immunity could have a very substantial impact on the overall course of the pandemic and is a key detail to consider for epidemiologists as they try to scope out how severely COVID-19 will affect communities in the coming months,\" says Crotty.\n\nThe work was funded by the NIH NIAID (AI142742, AI135078, AI007036, AI00738475N9301900065, and U19 AI118626), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Johnathan and Mary Tu Foundation and internal LJI institutional funds.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515085708.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T13:57:08", "title": "A soft touch for robotic hardware: Combined muscles and sensors made from soft materials allow for flexible robots", "text": "Robots can be made from soft materials, but the flexibility of such robots is limited by the inclusion of rigid sensors necessary for their control.

A robot which operates in the real world needs to understand its environment and itself in order to navigate and perform tasks.\n\nIf the world was entirely predictable, then a robot would be fine moving around without the need to learn anything new about its environment. But reality is unpredictable and ever changing, so machine learning helps robots adapt to unfamiliar situations. Although this is theoretically true for all robots, it is especially important for soft-bodied robots as the physical properties of these are intrinsically less predictable than their rigid counterparts.\n\n\"Take for example a robot with pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM), rubber and fiber-based fluid-driven systems which expand and contract to move,\" said Associate Professor Kohei Nakajima from the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. \"PAMs inherently suffer random mechanical noise and hysteresis, which is essentially material stress over time. Accurate laser-based monitors help maintain control through feedback, but these rigid sensors restrict a robot's movement, so we came up with something new.\"\n\nNakajima and his team thought if they could model a PAM in real time, then they could maintain good control of it. However, given the ever-changing nature of PAMs, this is not realistic with traditional methods of mechanical modeling. So the team turned to a powerful and established machine learning technique called reservoir computing. This is where information about a system, in this case the PAM, is fed into a special artificial neural network in real time, so the model is ever changing and thus adapts to the environment.\n\n\"We found the electrical resistance of PAM material changes depending on its shape during a contraction. So we pass this data to the network so it can accurately report on the state of the PAM,\" said Nakajima. \"Ordinary rubber is an insulator, so we incorporated carbon into our material to more easily read its varying resistance. We found the system emulated the existing laser-displacement sensor with equally high accuracy in a range of test conditions.\"\n\nThanks to this method, a new generation of soft robotic technology may be possible. This could include robots that work with humans, for example wearable rehabilitation devices or biomedical robots, as the extra soft touch means interactions with them are gentle and safe.\n\n\"Our study suggests reservoir computing could be used in applications besides robotics. Remote-sensing applications, which need real-time information processed in a decentralized manner, could greatly benefit,\" said Nakajima. \"And other researchers who study neuromorphic computing -- intelligent computer systems -- might also be able to incorporate our ideas into their own work to improve the performance of their systems.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164231.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:31", "title": "Largest and hottest shield volcano on Earth", "text": "In a recently published study, researchers from the University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology revealed the largest and hottest shield volcano on Earth. A team of volcanologists and ocean explorers used several lines of evidence to determine P\u016bh\u0101honu, a volcano within the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument now holds this distinction.\n\nGeoscientists and the public have long thought Mauna Loa, a culturally-significant and active shield volcano on the Big Island of Hawai'i, was the largest volcano in the world. However, after surveying the ocean floor along the mostly submarine Hawaiian leeward volcano chain, chemically analyzing rocks in the UH M\u0101noa rock collection, and modeling the results of these studies, the research team came to a new conclusion. P\u016bh\u0101honu, meaning 'turtle rising for breath' in Hawaiian, is nearly twice as big as Mauna Loa.\n\n\"It has been proposed that hotspots that produce volcano chains like Hawai'i undergo progressive cooling over 1-2 million years and then die,\" said Michael Garcia, lead author of the study and retired professor of Earth Sciences at SOEST. \"However, we have learned from this study that hotspots can undergo pulses of melt production. A small pulse created the Midway cluster of now extinct volcanoes and another, much bigger one created P\u016bh\u0101honu. This will rewrite the textbooks on how mantle plumes work.\"\n\nIn 1974, P\u016bh\u0101honu (then called Gardner Pinnacles) was suspected as the largest Hawaiian volcano based on very limited survey data. Subsequent studies of the Hawaiian Islands concluded that Mauna Loa was the largest volcano but they included the base of the volcano that is below sea level that was not considered in the 1974 study. The new comprehensive surveying and modeling, using methods similar to those used for Mauna Loa show that P\u016bh\u0101honu is the largest.\n\nThis study highlights Hawaiian volcanoes, not only now but for millions of years, have been erupting some of the hottest magma on Earth. This work also draws attention to an infrequently visited part of the state of Hawai'i that has ecological, historical and cultural importance.\n\n\"We are sharing with the science community and the public that we should be calling this volcano by the name the Hawaiians have given to it, rather than the western name for the two rocky small islands that are the only above sea level remnants of this once majestic volcano,\" said Garcia.\n\nThis work was funded by the National Science Foundation, Schmidt Ocean Institute and the University of Hawai'i.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143600.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:36:00", "title": "Seeing the universe through new lenses", "text": "Like crystal balls for the universe's deeper mysteries, galaxies and other massive space objects can serve as lenses to more distant objects and phenomena along the same path, bending light in revelatory ways.\n\nGravitational lensing was first theorized by Albert Einstein more than 100 years ago to describe how light bends when it travels past massive objects like galaxies and galaxy clusters.\n\nThese lensing effects are typically described as weak or strong, and the strength of a lens relates to an object's position and mass and distance from the light source that is lensed. Strong lenses can have 100 billion times more mass than our sun, causing light from more distant objects in the same path to magnify and split, for example, into multiple images, or to appear as dramatic arcs or rings.\n\nThe major limitation of strong gravitational lenses has been their scarcity, with only several hundred confirmed since the first observation in 1979, but that's changing ... and fast.\n\nA new study by an international team of scientists revealed 335 new strong lensing candidates based on a deep dive into data collected for a U.S. Department of Energy-supported telescope project in Arizona called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The study, published May 7 in The Astrophysical Journal, benefited from the winning machine-learning algorithm in an international science competition.\n\n\"Finding these objects is like finding telescopes that are the size of a galaxy,\" said David Schlegel, a senior scientist in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (Berkeley Lab's) Physics Division who participated in the study. \"They're powerful probes of dark matter and dark energy.\"\n\nThese newly discovered gravitational lens candidates could provide specific markers for precisely measuring distances to galaxies in the ancient universe if supernovae are observed and precisely tracked and measured via these lenses, for example.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStrong lenses also provide a powerful window into the unseen universe of dark matter, which makes up about 85 percent of the matter in the universe, as most of the mass responsible for lensing effects is thought to be dark matter. Dark matter and the accelerating expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, are among the biggest mysteries that physicists are working to solve.\n\nIn the latest study, researchers enlisted Cori, a supercomputer at Berkeley Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), to automatically compare imaging data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) -- one of three surveys conducted in preparation for DESI -- with a training sample of 423 known lenses and 9,451 non-lenses.\n\nThe researchers grouped the candidate strong lenses into three categories based on the likelihood that they are, in fact, lenses: Grade A for the 60 candidates that are most likely to be lenses, Grade B for the 105 candidates with less pronounced features, and Grade C for the 176 candidate lenses that have fainter and smaller lensing features than those in the other two categories.\n\nXiaosheng Huang, the study's lead author, noted that the team already succeeded in winning time on the Hubble Space Telescope to confirm some of the most promising lensing candidates revealed in the study, with observing time on the Hubble that began in late 2019.\n\n\"The Hubble Space Telescope can see the fine details without the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere,\" Huang said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe lens candidates were identified with the assistance of a neural network, which is a form of artificial intelligence in which the computer program is trained to gradually improve its image-matching over time to provide an increasing success rate in identifying lenses. Computerized neural networks are inspired by the biological network of neurons in the human brain.\n\n\"It takes hours to train the neural network,\" Huang said. \"There is a very sophisticated fitting model of 'What is a lens?' and 'What is not a lens?'\"\n\nThere was some painstaking manual analysis of lensing images to help pick the best images to train the network from tens of thousands of images, Huang noted. He recalled one Saturday during which he sat down with student researchers for the entire day to pore over tens of thousands of images to develop sample lists of lenses and non-lenses.\n\n\"We didn't just select these at random,\" Huang said. \"We had to augment this set with hand-selected examples that look like lenses but are not lenses,\" for example, \"and we selected those that could be potentially confusing.\"\n\nStudent involvement was key in the study, he added. \"The students worked diligently on this project and solved many tough problems, all while taking a full load of classes,\" he said. One of the students who worked on the study, Christopher Storfer, was later selected to participate in the DOE Science Undergraduate Laboratory Internship (SULI) program at Berkeley Lab.\n\nResearchers have already improved upon the algorithm that was used in the latest study to speed up the identification of possible lenses. While an estimated 1 in 10,000 galaxies acts as a lens, the neural network can eliminate most of the non-lenses. \"Rather than going through 10,000 images to find one, now we have just a few tens,\" he said.\n\nThe neural network was originally developed for The Strong Gravitational Lens Finding Challenge, a programming competition that ran from November 2016 to February 2017 that motivated the development of automated tools for finding strong lenses.\n\nWith a growing body of observational data, and new telescope projects like DESI and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) that is now scheduled to start up in 2023, there is heated competition to mine this data using sophisticated artificial intelligence tools, Schlegel said.\n\n\"That competition is good,\" he said. A team based in Australia, for example, also found many new lensing candidates using a different approach. \"About 40 percent of what they found we didn't,\" and likewise the study that Schlegel participated in found many lensing candidates that the other team hadn't.\n\nHuang said the team has expanded its search for lenses in other sources of sky-imaging data, and the team is also considering whether to plug into a broader set of computing resources to expedite the hunt.\n\n\"The goal for us is to reach 1,000\" new lensing candidates, Schlegel said.\n\nNERSC is a DOE Office of Science User Facility.\n\nStudy participants included researchers from the University of San Francisco, Berkeley Lab, the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Siena College, the University of Wyoming, the University of Arizona, the University of Toronto and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, and Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay in France.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143558.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:35:58", "title": "Multiscale crop modeling effort required to assess climate change adaptation", "text": "Crop modeling is essential for understanding how to secure the food supply as the planet adapts to climate change. Many current crop models focus on simulating crop growth and yield at the field scale, but lack genetic and physiological data, which may hamper accurate production and environmental impact assessment at larger scales.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Nature Plants, researchers identify a series of multiscale and multidisciplinary components -- from crop genetics up to global factors -- that are critical for finding environmentally sustainable solutions to food security.\n\nMany crop models focus on understanding how plant characteristics such as leaf size play into the crop yield at the field scale, the researchers said. \"Modeling at this scale is critical, but we would like to incorporate information from gene-to-cell and regional-to-global scale data into our modeling framework,\" said Bin Peng, a University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign postdoctoral researcher and co-lead author.\n\nThe study identifies components that could help generate a more informative modeling framework. \"Multiscale modeling is the key to linking the design of climate change adaptation strategies for crop and field management with a large-scale assessment of adaptation impact on crop production, environment, climate and economy,\" Peng said.\n\nThe study calls for a better representation of the physiological responses of crops to climate and environmental stressors -- like drought, extreme rainfall and ozone damage. \"Many physiological processes would be important to simulate the crop growth under stressed conditions accurately,\" Peng said.

As noted by the authors, the large-scale surveillance of coronaviruses in these animals, called pangolins, could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses circulating in the wild, and could help prevent and control emerging infectious diseases.\n\nLast December, an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. Recent studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -- the virus that causes COVID-19 -- could have originated in bats. But SARS-CoV-2 may have spilled over to humans from another intermediate host, and the source of this virus is still unknown. To effectively control the disease and prevent new spillovers, it is critical to identify the animal origin of this newly emerging coronavirus. In the new study, Chen and colleagues examined whether pangolins could be an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe researchers assembled the whole genome of a coronavirus identified in two groups of sick Malayan pangolins. The results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus is genetically associated with SARS-CoV-2 and a group of bat coronaviruses. But further analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 did not arise directly from the pangolin coronavirus. Although this study does not support the idea that pangolins are an intermediate host directly responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that other coronaviruses could be circulating in pangolins. According to the authors, wildlife conservation and limited exposure to wildlife will be important to minimize the risk that coronaviruses will spill over from wild animals to humans.\n\nThe authors state, \"Pangolins could be natural hosts of Betacoronaviruses with an unknown potential to infect humans.

The disease's telltale signs -- cyclical fevers and chills -- are caused by successive broods of parasites multiplying in sync inside red blood cells, then bursting out in unison every few days.\n\nNow, a study shows that even when grown outside the body, malaria parasites can still keep a beat.\n\nReporting in the May 15 issue of the journal Science, researchers have uncovered rhythms in the parasite's gene activity levels that don't rely on time cues from the host, but instead are coordinated from within the parasite itself.\n\nThe findings indicate that the parasite that causes malaria has its own timekeeping machinery; an internal metronome that ticks of its own accord and causes thousands of parasite genes to ramp up and down at regular intervals.\n\n\"Malaria has all the molecular signatures of a clock,\" said Duke biology professor Steven Haase, the lead author of the study.\n\nUnderstanding how malaria's clock works might help develop new weapons against a disease that kills a child every two minutes, and has proven increasingly resistant to existing drugs, Haase said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHaase has spent years studying cell cycles in yeast to understand controls on the timing of events as one cell becomes two. But only recently has he turned to malaria. The work was prompted by a question that has vexed scientists: how do the parasites keep time?\n\nResearchers have long known that all the malaria parasites within an infected person's body -- millions of them -- move through their cell cycle at the same time. They invade red blood cells, proliferate and erupt out in synchronous waves, releasing new parasites that invade other red blood cells, and the cycle starts anew. But whether the parasites were actively coordinating their own schedule or merely responding to the daily circadian rhythms of their human host was a mystery.\n\nIn the new study, the scientists grew four strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in human red blood cells in the lab, where they were isolated from daily fluctuations in their host's body temperature, melatonin levels and other bodily rhythms.\n\nTogether with colleagues from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Florida Atlantic University and Montana State University, the team extracted the parasites' RNA every three hours for up to three days, and looked at when each gene was activated and what its level of expression was.\n\nThe researchers noted that, even without clues from a host, all the parasites within a given strain kept in step. Roughly 90% of the genes they examined appear to be clock-controlled, rising and falling in a predictable fashion, and with a sequence that repeats itself, over and over.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalyses show that the malaria clock keeps time just as well as the biological clocks that control sleep cycles, metabolism and other circadian rhythms in humans and other animals, said co-author Francis Motta, assistant professor of mathematics at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nThe team's findings are supported by a separate study of mice infected with malaria, also appearing in the May 15 issue of Science, led by circadian rhythms expert Joseph Takahashi, an HHMI investigator at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nWhile very little of malaria's genome resembles clock genes found in other organisms, \"it's how the genes are arranged in a network that's important,\" Haase said.\n\nOther biological clocks consists of a network of interconnected genes that are switched on until the proteins they produce start to build up. In a chemical feedback loop, the higher concentration of proteins then acts to shut down the genes that made them.\n\nAs a next step, the team is looking into whether there is any crosstalk between the malaria clock and the clock ticking inside the cells of the human immune system.\n\nThe thinking is that parasites that are able to anticipate when their host's defenses are likely to be down can adjust the timing of their escape from red blood cells, possibly giving them an edge over more rhythmically challenged counterparts.\n\nIf we can figure out if and how the malaria parasite synchronizes the ticking of its clock with that of its host, Haase said, we might be able to disrupt those signals and help the human immune system better fight these invaders.\n\nThis research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (D12AP00025), the National Institutes of Health (R01 GM126555-01), and the National Science Foundation (DMS-1839299).

The team's findings were based on experiments in mice, while an accompanying paper, by biologist Steven Haase's team at Duke University, reports similar findings in the malaria parasite that infects humans.\n\nThe discovery overturns decades of conventional wisdom about the malaria parasite and raises the possibility of new treatments for the disease in the years ahead. Malaria kills around 400,000 people per year worldwide and remains a leading cause of death in many tropical nations, particularly among young children.\n\nScientists could potentially harness the parasite's biological rhythms to disrupt its invasion of humans' cells, says Takahashi, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Thousands of the parasite's genes turn on and off in a rhythmic fashion, he found, likely influencing a broad suite of physiological processes.\n\n\"It's as if the entire parasite is under this 24-hour program,\" he says. \"We think that if we can figure out what controls that program, we'd have a new target to try to inhibit the life cycle of the parasite.\"\n\nMatter of time\n\nCircadian clocks, which control metabolism on a daily rhythm, are important in virtually all living things, from bacteria to plants and animals. But little is known about the role of daily rhythms in parasites, which also have to contend with their hosts' clocks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn malaria, Plasmodium parasites grow inside the host's red blood cells and destroy them, triggering fevers and other symptoms. Doctors have long noticed that these fevers are rhythmic, recurring every 24, 48, or 72 hours depending on the species of Plasmodium. But scientists have assumed the parasite merely follows its host's 24-hour rhythm.\n\nTakahashi, who discovered the genetic basis for mammals' circadian clocks in the 1990s, suspected that the parasite might set its own rhythm. He and postdoc Filipa Rijo-Ferreira had observed something similar in another kind of parasite.\n\nRijo-Ferreira and Takahashi discovered in 2017 that the parasite that causes sleeping sickness has its own circadian rhythm. In 2018, they reported that the parasite shifts its host's circadian clock, making people sleep during the day instead of at night. The idea that parasites have internal clocks \"just exploded my imagination,\" Rijo-Ferreira says. Until then, no one had reported such a timing mechanism in a parasite. After that, malaria, with its cycling fevers, seemed like the most promising place to look.\n\nTakahashi and Rijo-Ferreira, who pioneered the project in the lab, conducted a series of experiments using mice and the malaria parasite that infects them, Plasmodium chabaudi. First, they demonstrated that the parasite's rhythm persists in constant darkness and regardless of host feeding, with 4,000 of the parasite's roughly 5,000 genes cycling in their levels of activity. Then they showed that the parasite can shift its daily rhythm and that its rhythm persists even in mice genetically altered to have no rhythm of their own.\n\nThe group's discovery of a clock controlling host-pathogen dynamics highlights \"the fundamental and expansive role of circadian clocks in human health and disease,\" says Duke's Haase, whose team's results in the same issue of Science demonstrate an internal rhythm in a malaria parasite species that infects humans, Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHaase and Takahashi discovered by chance that they were working on the same question using different malaria parasite species, and they coordinated to publish their findings together. \"It was a phenomenal act of collegiality,\" Haase says.\n\nStop the clock\n\nUltimately, the researchers want to throw a wrench in the parasite's clockworks. Haase hopes that his and Takahashi's teams will figure out how the host and parasite rhythms interact, revealing new targets for therapies. That's the \"moon shot,\" he says.\n\nThere are currently no drugs that target the circadian clock, but the idea is gaining traction, Takahashi says. What's more, \"the efficacy of different drugs varies with time of day,\" he says. For example, some cholesterol-lowering drugs are taken at the end of the day to better work with our circadian rhythms, as cholesterol is produced mainly at night.\n\nIn the case of malaria, Plasmodium parasites are already showing signs of resistance to existing drugs. The new study hopefully opens the door to \"exploring whether the timing at which you give a drug can make it more effective,\" Rijo-Ferreira says.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143524.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:35:24", "title": "Fighting the COVID-19 pandemic and major diseases at the same time: A balancing act for biomedical scientists", "text": "Researchers, politicians and funding bodies find themselves in front of a unique situation and enormous challenge: The mounting pressure to accelerate and intensify efforts to tackle the COVID-19 pandemic while handling the growing threat from all other diseases endangering our society.

Xu studied U.S. cities with and without bike-share systems, using Census and company data to analyze how commuting patterns change when bike shares become available.\n\n\"This study shows that bike-share systems can drive a population to commute by bike,\" said Xu, whose study was published May 11 in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management.\n\nBike-share systems, common in cities in Europe and Asia, were launched in four U.S. cities in 2010 and as of 2016 had grown to more than 50. Not all systems have been successful: Convenience -- how easy it is to find and rent a bike -- is the key. In Seattle, for example, a city-owned bike-share program failed in 2017 due largely to a limited number of bikes and a lack of infrastructure, but private companies in the same market thrived prior to the pandemic.\n\n[Around the world, cities have enacted mobility restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak. The responses of bike-share companies, and bike-share usage, have varied by community.]\n\nAmong other interests in transportation and immigration policy, Xu researches the effects of bicycling on the environment and human health, and on the ways bike-share systems can play a role by expanding access to cycling.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"In general, biking is good and healthy, and it means less pollution and traffic, but it can be expensive, and people worry about their bikes being stolen, things like that,\" Xu said. \"Bike share solves some of these problems, because people don't need to worry about the cost and theft.\"\n\nFor this study, Xu sorted through nine years of demographic and commute statistics from the American Community Survey, a detailed, annual report by the Census Bureau. He then examined bike-share company data (through the National Association of City Transportation Officials) from 38 cities with systems, focusing on trips logged during morning and afternoon rush hours. By comparing the number, location and time of work-related bike commutes from Census data against bike-share company records of trips logged, both before and after the launch of bike shares, Xu was able to estimate the use of bike shares for commute trips.\n\nXu found that in both bike-share and non-bike-share cities, the rate of bike commuting increased, while car commuting decreased, from 2008-2016. However, the rate of bike commuting -- and the use of public transportation -- was significantly greater in bike-share cities.\n\nFor example, in bike-share cities in 2008, roughly 66% of commuters drove to work, about 1% biked, and 22% took transit. That compared to non-bike-share cities, where about 88% of commuters drove, fewer than 1% biked, and 4% took transit.\n\nBy 2016 -- after many bike-share systems had launched -- car commuting had fallen to 59% in bike-share cities, while bike commuting had climbed to 1.7% and transit to 26%. Commuting by car in non-bike-share cities had slipped to 83% in 2016, while bike commuting had grown to 1%, and transit to 6%.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNationwide, 0.6% of commuters bike to work, according to an American Community Survey report in 2017.\n\nIn general, cities with larger bike-share systems also experienced sharper increases in bicycle commuting, Xu said.\n\n\"This is not surprising: A large bike-share system means a higher density of public bicycles and is thus more accessible by commuters,\" he said. \"In contrast, sadly, Seattle's Pronto struggled to attract commuters and was finally doomed only after three years of operation partially due to its relatively small size.\"\n\nIn his paper, Xu points to Chicago, which operates a municipally owned bike-share system called Divvy. Prior to Divvy's launch in 2013, 1.5% of commuters biked to work, Xu said, but afterward, that rate grew to 2%.\n\nThe trends held, he said, even when controlling for a city's expansion of protected bike lanes -- another significant factor in whether people choose to bike to work, according to other research.\n\nOverall, the numbers before COVID-19 were promising, Xu said. The numbers could grow, he said, if communities and bike-share companies make changes that can boost the appeal of bike commuting: adding bike lanes to city streets, expanding programs to outlying communities, or increasing the allowable rental time. Many bike shares, for instance, last only up to a half-hour before a user has to pay for a new trip.\n\nXu is also the author of a previous paper analyzed the impact of bike-share systems on obesity rates.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143510.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:35:10", "title": "Surplus antioxidants are pathogenic for hearts and skeletal muscle: This discovery may have clinical importance in management of heart failure", "text": "Many heart diseases are linked to oxidative stress, an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. The body reacts to reduce oxidative stress -- where the redox teeter-totter has gone too far up -- through production of endogenous antioxidants that reduce the reactive oxygen species. This balancing act is called redox homeostasis.\n\nBut what happens if the redox teeter-totter goes too far down, creating antioxidative stress, also known as reductive stress? Rajasekaran Namakkal-Soorappan, Ph.D., associate professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Pathology, and colleagues have found that reductive stress, or RS/AS, is also pathological. This discovery, they say, may have clinical importance in management of heart failure.\n\nThey report that RS causes pathological heart enlargement and diastolic dysfunction in a mouse model. This study, published in the journal Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, was led by Namakkal-Soorappan and Pei Ping, Ph.D., David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles.\n\n\"Antioxidant-based therapeutic approaches for human heart failure should consider a thorough evaluation of antioxidant levels before the treatment,\" they said. \"Our findings demonstrate that chronic RS is intolerable and adequate to induce heart failure.\"\n\nThe study used transgenic mice that had upregulated genes for antioxidants in the heart, which increased the amounts of antioxidant proteins and reduced glutathione, creating RS. One mouse line had low upregulation, and one had high upregulation, creating chronic low RS and chronic high RS, respectively, in the hearts of the mice.\n\nThe mice with high RS showed pathological heart changes called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and had an abnormally high heart ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction at 6 months of age. Sixty percent of the high-RS mice died by 18 months of age.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe mice with low RS had normal survival rates, but they developed the heart changes at about 15 months of age, suggesting that even moderate RS can lead to irreversible damage in the heart over time.\n\nGiving high-RS mice a chemical that blocked biosynthesis of glutathione, beginning at about 6 weeks of age, prevented RS and rescued the mice from pathological heart changes.\n\nGobinath Shanmugam, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the UAB Department of Pathology, and Namakkal-Soorappan point out that a 2019 survey found about 77 percent of Americans are consuming dietary supplements every day, and within this group, about 58 percent are consuming antioxidants as multivitamins. Thus, a chronic consumption of antioxidant drugs by any individual without knowing their redox state might result in RS, which can induce pathology and slowly damage the heart.\n\nEffect of RS on skeletal muscle\n\nIn a related study, published in the journal Redox Biology, Namakkal-Soorappan looked at the impact of RS on myosatellite cells, which are also known as muscle stem cells. These cells, located near skeletal muscle fibers, are able to regenerate and differentiate into skeletal muscle after acute or chronic muscle injury. The regulation of myosatellite cells is of interest given the loss of skeletal muscle mass during aging or in chronic conditions like diabetes and AIDS.\n\nRecently, Namakkal-Soorappan reported that tilting the redox teeter-totter to oxidative stress impaired regeneration of skeletal muscle. Now, in the Redox Biology paper, he has shown that tilting the redox to RS also causes significant inhibition of muscle satellite cell differentiation.\n\nRather than genetic manipulation to induce RS, as was done in the heart study, the researchers used the chemical sulforaphane or direct augmentation of intracellular glutathione to induce RS in cultured mouse myoblast cells. Both treatments inhibited myoblast differentiation. Finally, authors attempted to withdraw antioxidative stress by growing cells in medium without sulforaphane, which removes the RS and accelerates the differentiation. Namakkal-Soorappan and colleagues found that a pro-oxidative milieu, through a mild generation of reactive oxygen species, was required for myoblast differentiation.\n\nThe researchers also showed that genetic silencing of a negative regulator of the antioxidant genes also inhibited myoblast differentiation.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514131742.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T18:17:42", "title": "NASA's ICESat-2 measures Arctic Ocean's sea ice thickness, snow cover", "text": "Arctic sea ice helps keep Earth cool, as its bright surface reflects the Sun's energy back into space. Each year scientists use multiple satellites and data sets to track how much of the Arctic Ocean is covered in sea ice, but its thickness is harder to gauge. Initial results from NASA's new Ice Cloud and land Elevation Satellite-2 (ICESat-2) suggest that the sea ice has thinned by as much as 20% since the end of the first ICESat mission (2003-2009), contrary to existing studies that find sea ice thickness has remained relatively constant in the last decade.\n\nArctic sea ice thickness dropped drastically in the first decade of the 21st Century, as measured by the first ICESat mission from 2003 to 2009 and other methods. The European Space Agency's CryoSat-2, launched in 2010, has measured a relatively consistent thickness in Arctic sea ice since then. With the launch of ICESat-2 in 2018, researchers looked to this new way of measuring sea ice thickness to advance the study of this data record.\n\n\"We can't get thickness just from ICESat-2 itself, but we can use other data to derive the measurement,\" said Petty. For example, the researchers subtract out the height of snow on top of the sea ice by using computer models that estimate snowfall. \"The first results were very encouraging.\"\n\nIn their study, published recently in the Journal of Geophysical Research: Oceans, Petty and his colleagues generated maps of Arctic sea ice thickness from October 2018 to April 2019 and saw the ice thickening through the winter as expected.\n\nOverall, however, calculations using ICESat-2 found that the ice was thinner during that time period than what researchers have found using CryoSat-2 data. Petty's group also found that small but significant 20% decline in sea ice thickness by comparing February/March 2019 ICESat-2 measurements with those calculated using ICESat in February/March 2008 -- a decline that the CryoSat-2 researchers don't see in their data.\n\nThese are two very different approaches to measuring sea ice, Petty said, each with its own limitations and benefits. CryoSat-2 carries a radar to measure height, as opposed to ICESat-2's lidar, and radar mostly passes through snow to measure the top of the ice. Radar measurements like the ones from CryoSat-2 could be thrown off by seawater flooding the ice, he noted. In addition, ICESat-2 is still a young mission and the computer algorithms are still being refined, he said, which could ultimately change the thickness findings.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"I think we're going to learn a lot from having these two approaches to measuring ice thickness. They might be giving us an upper and lower bound on the sea ice thickness, and the right answer is probably somewhere in between,\" Petty said. \"There are reasons why ICESat-2 estimates could be low, and reasons why CryoSat-2 could be high, and we need to do more work to understand and bring these measurements in line with each other.\"\n\nICESat-2 has a laser altimeter, which uses pulses of light to precisely measure height down to about an inch. Each second, the instrument sends out 10,000 pulses of light that bounce off the surface of Earth and return to the satellite and records the length of time it takes to make that round trip. The light reflects off the first substance it hits, whether that's open water, bare sea ice or snow that has accumulated on top of the ice, so scientists use a combination of ICESat-2 measurements and other data to calculate sea ice thickness.\n\nBy comparing ICESat-2 data with measurements from another satellite, researchers have also created the first satellite-based maps of the amount of snow that has accumulated on top of Arctic sea ice, tracking this insulating material.\n\n\"The Arctic sea ice pack has changed dramatically since monitoring from satellites began more than four decades ago,\" said Nathan Kurtz, ICESat-2 deputy project scientist at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. \"The extraordinary accuracy and year-round measurement capability of ICESat-2 provides an exciting new tool to allow us to better understand the mechanisms leading to these changes, and what this means for the future.\"\n\nWith ICESat-2 and CryoSat-2 using two different methods to measure ice thickness -- one measuring the top of the snow, the other the boundary between the bottom of the snow layer and the top of the ice layer -- but researchers realized they could combine the two to calculate the snow depth.\n\n\"This is the first time ever that we can get snow depth across the entire Arctic Ocean's sea ice cover,\" said Ron Kwok, a sea ice scientist at NASA's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California and author of another study in JGR Oceans. \"The Arctic region is a desert -- but what snow we do get is very important in terms of the climate and insulating sea ice.\"\n\nThe study found that snow starts building up slowly in October, when newly formed ice has an average of about 2 inches (5 centimeters) of snow on it and multiyear ice has an average of 5.5 inches (14 cm) of snow. Snowfall picks up later in the winter in December and January and reaches its maximum depth in April, when the relatively new ice has an average of 6.7 inches (17 cm) and the older ice has an average of 10.6 inches (27 cm) of snow.\n\nWhen the snow melts in the spring, it can pool up on the sea ice -- those melt ponds absorb heat from the Sun and can warm up the ice faster, just one of the impacts of snow on ice.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514131735.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T18:17:35", "title": "Making quantum 'waves' in ultrathin materials: Study reveals how wavelike plasmons could power up a new class of sensing and photochemical technologies at the nanoscale", "text": "Wavelike, collective oscillations of electrons known as \"plasmons\" are very important for determining the optical and electronic properties of metals.\n\nIn atomically thin 2D materials, plasmons have an energy that is more useful for applications, including sensors and communication devices, than plasmons found in bulk metals. But determining how long plasmons live and whether their energy and other properties can be controlled at the nanoscale (billionths of a meter) has eluded many.\n\nNow, as reported in the journal Nature Communications, a team of researchers co-led by the Department of Energy's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory (Berkeley Lab) -- with support from the Department of Energy's Center for Computational Study of Excited-State Phenomena in Energy Materials (C2SEPEM) -- has observed long-lived plasmons in a new class of conducting transition metal dichalcogenide (TMD) called \"quasi 2D crystals.\"\n\nTo understand how plasmons operate in quasi 2D crystals, the researchers characterized the properties of both nonconductive electrons as well as conductive electrons in a monolayer of the TMD tantalum disulfide. Previous studies only looked at conducting electrons. \"We discovered that it was very important to carefully include all the interactions between both types of electrons,\" said C2SEPEM Director Steven Louie, who led the study. Louie also holds titles as senior faculty scientist in the Materials Sciences Division at Berkeley Lab and professor of physics at UC Berkeley.\n\nThe researchers developed sophisticated new algorithms to compute the material's electronic properties, including plasmon oscillations with long wavelengths, \"as this was a bottleneck with previous computational approaches,\" said lead author Felipe da Jornada, who was a postdoctoral researcher in Berkeley Lab's Materials Sciences Division at the time of the study. Jornada is currently an assistant professor in materials science and engineering at Stanford University.\n\nTo the researchers' surprise, the results from calculations performed by the Cori supercomputer at Berkeley Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC) revealed that plasmons in quasi 2D TMDs are much more stable -- for as long as approximately 2 picoseconds, or 2 trillionths of a second -- than previously thought.\n\nTheir findings also suggest that plasmons generated by quasi 2D TMDs could enhance the intensity of light by more than 10 million times, opening the door for renewable chemistry (chemical reactions triggered by light), or the engineering of electronic materials that can be controlled by light.\n\nIn future studies, the researchers plan to investigate how to harness the highly energetic electrons released by such plasmons upon decay, and if they can be used to catalyze chemical reactions.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514131733.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T18:17:33", "title": "The carnivorous plant lifestyle is gene costly", "text": "Plants can produce energy-rich biomass with the help of light, water and carbon dioxide. This is why they are at the beginning of the food chains. But the carnivorous plants have turned the tables and hunt animals. Insects are their main food source.\n\nA publication in the journal Current Biology now sheds light on the secret life of the green carnivores. The plant scientist Rainer Hedrich and the evolutionary bioinformatician J\u00f6rg Schultz, both from Julius-Maximilians-Universit\u00e4t (JMU) W\u00fcrzburg in Bavaria, Germany, and their colleague Mitsujasu Hasebe from the University of Okazaki (Japan) have deciphered and analysed the genomes of three carnivorous plant species.\n\nThey studied the Venus flytrap Dionaea muscipula, which originates from North America, the globally occurring waterwheel plant Aldrovanda vesiculosa and the spoon-leaved sundew Drosera spatulata, which is widely distributed in Asia.\n\nAll three belong to the sundew family. Nevertheless, they have each conquered different habitats and developed their own trapping mechanisms. In Dionaea and Aldrovanda, the ends of the leaves are transformed into folding traps. The sundew, on the other hand, attaches its prey to the leaf surface with sticky tentacles.\n\nBasic genes for carnivory\n\nThe first thing the international research team found out was that, despite their different lifestyles and trapping mechanisms, Venus flytrap, sundew and waterwheel have a common \"basic set\" of genes that are essential for the carnivorous lifestyle.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The function of these genes is related to the ability to sense and digest prey animals and to utilise their nutrients,\" explains Rainer Hedrich.\n\n\"We were able to trace the origin of the carnivory genes back to a duplication event that occurred many millions of years ago in the genome of the last common ancestor of the three carnivorous species,\" says J\u00f6rg Schultz. The duplication of the entire genome has provided evolution with an ideal playing ground for developing new functions.\n\nGenetic poverty despite a special way of life\n\nTo their surprise, the researchers discovered that the plants do not need a particularly large number of genes for carnivory. Instead, the three species studied are actually among the most gene-poor plants known. Drosera has 18,111, Dionaea 21,135 and Aldrovanda 25,123 genes. In contrast, most plants have between 30,000 and 40,000 genes.\n\nHow can this be reconciled with the fact that a wealth of new genes is usually needed to develop new ways of life? \"This can only mean that the specialization in animal food was accompanied by an increase in the number of genes, but also a massive loss of genes,\" concludes developmental biologist Hasebe.\n\nadvertisement\n\nRoot genes are active in the trapping organs\n\nMost of the genes required for the insect traps are also found in slightly modified form in normal plants. \"In carnivorous plants, several genes are active in the trapping organs, which in other plants have their effect in the root. In the trapping organs, these genes are only switched on when the prey is secure,\" explains Hedrich. This finding is consistent with the fact that the roots are considerably reduced in Venus flytrap and sundew. In the waterwheel they are completely absent.\n\nFurther research into the trapping function\n\nThe researchers now have an insight into the evolution of carnivory in plants and hold three blueprints for this particular way of life in their hands. Their next goal is to gain an even better understanding of the molecular basis of the trapping function.\n\n\"We have found that the Venus flytrap counts the electrical stimuli triggered by the prey, can remember this number for a certain time and finally makes a decision that corresponds to the number,\" says Hedrich. Now it is important to understand the biophysical-biochemical principle according to which carnivorous plants count.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514131731.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T18:17:31", "title": "New guidance related to COVID-19 and stroke care: Virus may increase stroke risk in certain patients, and it may be first symptom", "text": "A University of Missouri Health Care neurologist has published more than 40 new recommendations for evaluating and treating stroke patients based on international research examining the link between stroke and novel coronavirus (COVID-19).\n\nNeurologist Adnan I. Qureshi, MD, a professor of clinical neurology at the MU School of Medicine, led a team of stroke experts from 18 countries with documented COVID-19 outbreaks to develop recommendations for doctors evaluating patients with acute ischemic stroke who have either suspected or confirmed COVID-19 infection.\n\nThe international panel noted increased clotting in COVID-19 patients, which raised their risk for stroke. The research team found evidence that young people without previous risk factors for stroke are experiencing ischemic stroke with clots in the arteries of the brain presumably related to a COVID-19 infection. The average onset of stroke in COVID-19 patients occurred 10 days after infection, but in some cases, stroke was the initial symptom.\n\n\"People may come to the emergency department with stroke, and that may be the initial manifestation of COVID-19 infection, which puts a clear burden on providers because now you may not know if the patient you are evaluating for stroke may actually have underlying COVID-19 infection,\" Qureshi said. \"The purpose of these recommendations is to provide a step-by-step guide of how to manage these patients. The modifications we suggest have implications for the health of patients, but also the health of those who are involved in their care.\"\n\nQureshi's research indicates health care workers are at risk of acquiring COVID-19 from stroke patients and they should take safety precautions while limiting the number of care providers who have direct interaction with each patient. The guidelines also call for providers to treat any suspected COVID-19 stroke patient as though the patient has the infection, ensuring the sanitation of all equipment used during the stroke assessment. If a stroke patient is suspected to have COVID-19, a chest CT scan can provide rapid evidence of a possible infection in the lungs.\n\n\"Since COVID-19 actually involves the lungs, a simultaneous scan of the chest and brain can check for stroke and identify changes in the lungs that may identify whether this patient truly has or does not have COVID-19 infection,\" Qureshi said. \"This step has been incorporated into acute stroke protocol at MU Health Care.\"\n\nQureshi encourages stroke patients and their family members to recall any symptoms of dry cough, fever or body aches before the stroke, which may help the provider determine if the stroke is related to an underlying COVID-19 infection. If a COVID-19 infection is confirmed and other organs have been affected, guidelines suggest a Sequential Organ Failure Assessment (SOFA) can provide an overall prognosis before determining the appropriate stroke treatment in COVID-19 patients.\n\nQureshi's study, \"Management of acute ischemic stroke in patients with COVID-19 infection: Report of an international panel,\" also featured contributions from MU Health Care neurologist Camilo R.

The eight patients also had a condition called secondary hemophagocytic lymphohistiocytosis (sHLH), which is characterized by overactivation of the immune system and organ failure. One patient, who did not require mechanical ventilation, improved rapidly after starting treatment with the drug and was discharged from the hospital 9 days later. But the therapy did not prevent three out of seven patients on ventilators from dying, and it's not yet clear whether it improves mortality rates. The report appears May 14 in the journal Cell Host & Microbe.\n\n\"These data argue that the administration of anakinra may be a viable treatment in severe COVID-19 with sHLH, supporting larger clinical studies to validate this concept,\" says senior author Evangelos J. Giamarellos-Bourboulis, a professor of internal medicine at the Medical School of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens.\n\nThe death rate in patients with severe COVID-19 admitted to intensive care units (ICUs) is estimated to be between 50% and 65%. Severe complications of COVID-19 are thought to be driven by inflammatory responses, particularly through signaling molecules called interleukin 1? (IL-1?) and interleukin 6 (IL-6). The overproduction of IL-1? by immune cells called macrophages can cause sHLH, also known as macrophage activation syndrome, which is characterized by low counts of blood cells, excessive blood clotting, kidney injury, and liver dysfunction. Anakinra inhibits IL-1? signaling and has been shown to reduce the mortality of patients with signs of sHLH by 30%.\n\nIn the new study, the researchers tested whether anakinra could effectively treat severely ill COVID-19 patients with pneumonia and sHLH. Seven of the eight patients were males who had respiratory failure, were on ventilators in ICUs in Greece, and had serious underlying conditions such as heart disease and high blood pressure. They were treated with anakinra intravenously 200 mg every 8 hours for 7 days. They also received treatment with the antimalarial drug hydroxychloroquine and broad-spectrum antibiotics. The researchers monitored their outcomes over the course of 4 weeks.\n\nAnakinra treatment improved the majority of laboratory findings and decreased signs of sHLH in the ICU patients. All of them showed improved respiratory function, as indicated by a 15% to 117% increase in the ratio of partial pressure arterial oxygen and fraction of inspired oxygen (PaO2/FiO2), which compares the oxygen level in the blood to the oxygen concentration that is breathed. Moreover, six patients needed a lower dose of drugs that increase blood pressure. Although three of the ICU patients died, previous studies have shown that sHLH can lead to death rates as high as 67%.\n\nThe non-ICU patient was a 71-year-old woman who was hospitalized in the Netherlands for COVID-19 2 weeks after the third cycle of chemotherapy. This patient was also on hydroxychloroquine for rheumatoid arthritis. She received anakinra treatment 300 mg once daily intravenously for 4 days, followed by 100 mg once daily for an additional 5 days. She improved within the first day of anakinra treatment, showing a reduced need for oxygen and a decrease in signs of sHLH, and was discharged 9 days after starting treatment. According to the authors, these results suggest that anakinra may prevent the progression of respiratory failure and the need for mechanical ventilation in COVID-19 patients with sHLH.\n\n\"We believe that anakinra has the potential to improve outcomes in patients with severe COVID-19,\" says first author George Dimopoulos of the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. \"Larger clinical trials are warranted to validate these results and demonstrate the usefulness of anti-IL-1 therapy when COVID-19 is complicated by sHLH.\"\n\nThe study was funded in part by the Horizon 2020 grant ImmunoSep and the Hellenic Institute for the Study of Sepsis.

X-ray computed tomography, better known by its acronym CT, is a widely used method of obtaining cross-sectional images of objects.\n\nNow a research team -- led by Tohoku University Professor, Wataru Yashiro -- has developed a new method using intense synchrotron radiation that produces higher quality images within milliseconds.\n\nHigh-speed, high-resolution X-ray CT is currently possible using intense synchrotron radiation. However, this requires samples to be rotated at high speed to obtain images from many directions. This would make CT scans more akin to a rollercoaster ride!\n\nExtreme rotation also makes controlling the temperature or atmosphere of the sample impossible.\n\nNevertheless, the research team solved this conundrum by creating an optical system that splits single synchrotron X-ray beams into many. These beams then shine onto the sample from different directions at the same time; thus, negating the need to rotate the sample.\n\nThis \"multi-beam\" method is no easy task since the direction of X-rays cannot be easily changed. Unlike visible light, X-rays interact with matters weakly, making it difficult to utilize mirrors and prisms to change the path of the beams.\n\nTo overcome this, the research team used micro-fabrication techniques to create uniquely shaped crystals.

A few preliminary studies have shown toxicity of these substances to plants and invertebrates.\n\n\"This is the first multi-decadal temporal record of scPFCA deposition in the Arctic,\" explained Criscitiello. \"Our results suggest that the CFC-replacement compounds mandated by the Montreal Protocol are the dominant source of some scPFCAs to remote regions.\"\n\nOver the past four years, Criscitiello and colleagues drilled four ice cores across the eastern Canadian high Arctic.

These results demonstrate that both perfluoroalkyl carboxylic acids (PFCAs) and perfluorooctane sulfonate (PFOS) have continuous and increasing deposition on the Devon Ice Cap despite North American and international regulations and phase-outs. This is the likely result of ongoing manufacture, use, and emissions of these persistent pollutants, as well as their precursors and other new compounds in regions outside of North America.\n\n\"These results show the need for a more holistic approach when deciding to ban and replace chemical compounds,\" explained Criscitiello. \"Chemicals degrade, and developing a strong understanding of how they degrade in the environment, and what they degrade to, is vital.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514131710.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T18:17:10", "title": "Can COVID-19 spread through fecal matter?

But even before COVID-19, given concerns about a rapidly growing population and hunger around the world, the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO) issued a global call for zero tolerance on food waste. However, the lack of regulation, standardization, and general understanding of date labeling on food products (such as \"best by\" and \"use by\" dates) leads to billions of dollars per year in food waste in the United States alone. Many people don't realize that date labels on food products (with the exception of infant formula) are entirely at the manufacturer's discretion and are not supported by robust scientific evidence.\n\nTo address this concern and combat global food waste, researchers at the University of Maryland have come together across departments in the College of Agriculture & Natural Resources with the goal of clarifying the science or lack thereof behind food date labels, highlighting the need for interdisciplinary research and global research trends in their new publication in Food Control.\n\n\"We have 50 different types of date labels that are currently used in the US because there is no regulation -- best by, best if used by, use by -- and we as consumers don't know what these things mean,\" says Debasmita Patra, assistant research professor in Environmental Science and Technology and lead author on the paper. \"The labeling is the manufacturer's best estimation based on taste or whatever else, and it is not scientifically proven. But our future intention is to scientifically prove what is the best way to label foods. As a consumer and as a mom, a best by date might raise food safety concerns, but date labeling and food safety are not connected to each other right now, which is a wide source of confusion. And when billions of dollars are just going to the trash because of this, it's not a small thing.\"\n\nAccording to the United States Department of Agriculture's Economic Research Service (USDA-ERS), Americans discard or waste about 133 billion pounds of food each year, representing $161 billion and a 31% loss of food at the retail and consumer level. According to the FDA, 90% of Americans say they are likely to prematurely discard food because they misinterpret date labels because of food safety concerns or uncertainty on how to properly store the product. This simple confusion accounts for 20% of the total annual food waste in the United States, representing more than 26 billion pounds per year and over $32 billion in food waste.\n\n\"Food waste is a significant threat to food security,\" adds Paul Leisnham, associate professor in Environmental Science and Technology and co-author. \"Recognition of food waste due to confusion over date labeling is growing, but few studies have summarized the status of the research on this topic.\"\n\nThis was the goal of their latest publication, gathering support and background for their future work to reduce food waste, and providing guidance for future areas of research in this field. In order to achieve this, Patra enlisted Leisnham in her own department, but also relied on computational support and food quality and safety expertise from Abani Pradhan, associate professor in Nutrition and Food Science, and his postdoctoral fellow Collins Tanui, both co-authors on the paper.\n\n\"We wanted to see the trends and give some suggestions, because the paper shows that we are some of the very few who are thinking about truly interdisciplinary research connecting food labeling to food waste,\" says Patra. \"In fact, we were joking because one major finding was that environmental sciences and food science departments don't seem to collaborate on this topic, so we are doing something unique here at UMD.\"\n\n\"Our paper underlined the fact that future research on food waste and date labeling needs to take an interdisciplinary approach to better explore the perspectives of multiple stakeholders, adds Leisnham. \"Expertise from environmental science, food science, sociology, Extension education, and other disciplines can more effectively develop interventions to reduce behaviors that may increase food waste. This is an environmental issue, but involves the knowledge, attitudes, perceptions, and social behaviors of multiple stakeholders, including retailers, food-service providers, and diverse consumers.\"\n\nThe collaboration between environmental sciences and food sciences at UMD is an example of this collaboration in action, with the goal of establishing what science, if any, already underlies date labeling and connecting this to food quality and safety.\n\n\"Utilizing my expertise in experimental and mathematical modeling work, we aim to scientifically evaluate the quality characteristics, shelf life, and food spoilage risk of food products,\" says Pradhan. \"This would help in determining if the food products are of good quality beyond the mentioned dates, rather than discarding them prematurely. We anticipate to reduce food waste through our ongoing and future research findings.\"\n\nPatra stresses the importance of further collaboration through University of Maryland Extension (UME) to have maximum impact on food waste. \"Where is the confusion coming from?,\" says Patra. \"If we understand that, maybe we can better disseminate the information through our Extension work.\"\n\nPatra adds, \"Food is something that is involved in everybody's life, and so everyone needs to be a good food manager. But even now, there is no robust scientific evidence behind date labels, and yet those labels govern people's purchasing behavior. People look for something that has a longer 'best by' date thinking they are getting something better. And when you throw that food away, you are not only wasting the food, but also all the economics associated with that, like production costs, transportation from the whole farm to fork chain, and everything else that brought you that product just to be thrown away. Food safety, regulation, and education need to all combine to help solve this problem, which is why interdisciplinary collaboration is so important.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514115849.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T16:58:49", "title": "Even small disturbances can trigger catastrophic storms", "text": "You've probably seen the satellite images that show a hurricane developing: thick white clouds clumping together, arms spinning around a central eye as it heads for the coast.\n\nAfter decades of research, meteorologists still have questions about how hurricanes develop. Now, Florida State University researchers have found that even the smallest changes in atmospheric conditions could trigger a hurricane, information that will help scientists understand the processes that lead to these devastating storms.\n\n\"The whole motivation for this paper was that we still don't have that universal theoretical understanding of exactly how tropical cyclones form, and to really be able to forecast that storm-by-storm, it would help us to have that more solidly taken care of,\" said Jacob Carstens, a doctoral student in the Department of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Science.\n\nThe research by Carstens and Assistant Professor Allison Wing has been published in the Journal of Advances in Modeling Earth Systems.\n\nCurrent theories on the formation of hurricanes agree that some sort of disturbance must exist to start the process that leads to a hurricane. Carstens used numerical models that started with simple conditions to better understand exactly how those disturbances arise.\n\n\"We're trying to go as bare bones as possible, looking at just how exactly clouds want to organize themselves without any of these external factors playing into it to form a tropical cyclone more efficiently,\" he said. \"It's a way we can further round out our broader understanding and look more purely at the actual tropical cyclones themselves rather than the surrounding environment's impact on it.\"\n\nThe simulations started with mostly uniform conditions spread across the imaginary box where the model played out. Then, researchers added a tiny amount of random temperature fluctuations to kickstart the model and observed how the simulated clouds evolved.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDespite the random start to the simulation, the clouds didn't stay randomly arranged. They formed into clusters as the water vapor, thermal radiation and other factors interacted. As the clusters circulated through the simulated atmosphere, the researchers tracked when they formed hurricanes. They repeated the model at simulated latitudes between 0.1 degrees and 20 degrees north, representative of areas such as parts of western Africa, northern South America and the Caribbean. That range includes the latitudes where tropical cyclones typically form, along with latitudes very close to the equator where their formation is rare and less studied.\n\nThe scientists found that every simulation in latitudes between 10 and 20 degrees produced a major hurricane, even from the stable conditions under which they began the simulation. These came a few days after a vortex first emerged well above the surface and affected its surrounding environment.\n\nThey also showed the possibility of cloud interaction contributing to the development of a tropical cyclone very close to the equator, which rarely occurs in nature but has still been observed as close as 1.4 degrees north away.\n\nHurricanes are dangerous weather events. Forecasting can help prevent deaths, but a big storm can still cause billions of dollars in damage. A better theoretical understanding of their formation will help meteorologists predict and prepare for these storms, both in short-term forecasts and long-term climate projections, and communicate their understanding to the public.\n\n\"It's becoming ever more important in our field that we connect with emergency managers, the general population and other local officials to advise them on what they can expect, how they should prepare and what sorts of impacts are going to be heading their way,\" Carstens said. \"A more robust understanding of how tropical cyclones form can help us to better forecast their location, their track and their intensity.

The following day, the researchers swabbed the nasal passages of the cats and were able to detect the virus in two of the animals. Within three days, they detected the virus in all of the cats.\n\nThe day after the researchers administered virus to the first three cats, they placed another cat in each of their cages. Researchers did not administer SARS-CoV-2 virus to these cats.\n\nEach day, the researchers took nasal and rectal swabs from all six cats to assess them for the presence of the virus. Within two days, one of the previously uninfected cats was shedding virus, detected in the nasal swab, and within six days, all of the cats were shedding virus. None of the rectal swabs contained virus.\n\nEach cat shed SARS-CoV-2 from their nasal passages for up to six days. The virus was not lethal and none of the cats showed signs of illness. All of the cats ultimately cleared the virus.\n\n\"That was a major finding for us -- the cats did not have symptoms,\" says Kawaoka, who also holds a faculty appointment at the University of Tokyo. Kawaoka is also helping lead an effort to create a human COVID-19 vaccine called CoroFlu.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe findings suggest cats may be capable of becoming infected with the virus when exposed to people or other cats positive for SARS-CoV-2. It follows a study published in Science by scientists at the Chinese Academy of Agricultural Sciences that also showed cats (and ferrets) could become infected with and potentially transmit the virus. The virus is known to be transmitted in humans through contact with respiratory droplets and saliva.\n\n\"It's something for people to keep in mind,\" says Peter Halfmann, a research professor at UW-Madison who helped lead the study. \"If they are quarantined in their house and are worried about passing COVID-19 to children and spouses, they should also worry about giving it to their animals.\"\n\nBoth researchers advise that people with symptoms of COVID-19 avoid contact with cats. They also advise cat owners to keep their pets indoors, in order to limit the contact their cats have with other people and animals.\n\nKawaoka is concerned about the welfare of animals. The World Organization for Animal Health and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention say there is \"no justification in taking measures against companion animals that may compromise their welfare.\"\n\nHumans remain the biggest risk to other humans in transmission of the virus. There is no evidence cats readily transmit the virus to humans, nor are there documented cases in which humans have become ill with COVID-19 because of contact with cats.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThere are, however, confirmed instances of cats becoming infected because of close contact with humans infected with the virus, and several large cats at the Bronx Zoo have also tested positive for the virus.\n\nFor instance, according to an April 22 announcement from the U.S. Department of Agriculture, two cats in two private homes in New York state tested positive for COVID-19. One had been in a home with a person with a confirmed case of the viral disease. The cats showed mild signs of respiratory illness and were expected to make a full recovery.\n\nAdditional cats have also tested positive for COVID-19 after close contact with their human companions, says Sandra Newbury, director of the UW-Madison Shelter Medicine Program. Newbury is leading a research study in several states in the U.S. to test animal-shelter cats that might have previously been exposed to human COVID-19 cases.\n\n\"Animal welfare organizations are working very hard in this crisis to maintain the human-animal bond and keep pets with their people,\" says Newbury. \"It's a stressful time for everyone, and now, more than ever, people need the comfort and support that pets provide.\"\n\nNewbury has worked with the CDC and the American Veterinary Medical Association to develop recommendations for shelters housing potentially exposed pets, which they may do while owners are hospitalized or otherwise unable to provide care because of their illness. The UW-Madison study helps confirm experimentally that cats can become infected, though the risk of natural infection from exposure to SARS-CoV-2 seems to be quite low, Newbury says. Of the 22 animals the program has tested, none have had positive polymerase chain reaction tests for the virus, she adds.\n\n\"Cats are still much more likely to get COVID-19 from you, rather than you get it from a cat,\" says Keith Poulsen, director of the Wisconsin Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory, who recommends that pet owners first talk to their veterinarians about whether to have their animals tested. Testing should be targeted to populations of cats and other species shown to be susceptible to the virus and virus transmission.\n\nWith respect to pets, \"we're targeting companion animals in communal residences with at-risk populations, such as nursing homes and assisted living facilities,\" Poulsen says. \"There is a delicate balance of needing more information through testing and the limited resources and clinical implications of positive tests.\"\n\nSo, what should pet owners do?\n\nRuthanne Chun, associate dean for clinical affairs at UW Veterinary Care, offers the following advice:\n\nIf your pet lives indoors with you and is not in contact with any COVID-19 positive individual, it is safe to pet, cuddle and interact with your pet.\n\nIf you are COVID-19 positive, you should limit interactions with your pets to protect them from exposure to the virus.\n\nAdditional guidance on managing pets in homes where people are sick with COVID-19 is available from the American Veterinary Medical Association and CDC, including in this FAQ from AVMA.\n\n\"As always, animal owners should include pets and other animals in their emergency preparedness planning, including keeping on hand a two-week supply of food and medications,\" she says. \"Preparations should also be made for the care of animals should you need to be quarantined or hospitalized due to illness.\"\n\nThe study was supported by the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases and by the Japan Agency for Medical Research and Development.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514115834.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T16:58:34", "title": "SARS lessons for COVID-19 vaccine design", "text": "Important lessons learned from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2002-2003 could inform and guide vaccine design for COVID-19 according to University of Melbourne Professor Kanta Subbarao, Director of the WHO Centre for Reference and Research on Influenza at the Doherty Institute.\n\nIn an article published today in Cell Host and Microbe, Professor Subbarao stressed the importance of detecting a neutralising antibody response in recovered COVID-19 patients, and of studies of COVID-19 vaccines in animal models.\n\nNeutralising antibodies prevent infection by binding to a virus and blocking their ability to infect. After an infection, a host can produce neutralising antibodies to protect against future infection.\n\n\"The speed with which SARS-CoV-2, the virus that causes COVID-19, has spread around the world and its toll in numbers of cases, severe illness, and death has been staggering,\" she said.\n\n\"However, technological advances have made rapid vaccine development possible.

We now also know through animal experiments with SARS-CoV-2 that neutralising antibodies protect from reinfection,\" Professor Subbarao said.\n\n\"Two SARS vaccines were evaluated in humans, and a number of promising candidates were tested in pre-clinical studies, but they weren't pursued because SARS didn't re-emerge.\n\n\"However, the work on SARS is relevant to the COVID-19 pandemic because the two viruses share several features and many of the principles and experience with SARS vaccines will apply to SARS-CoV-2.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514115828.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T16:58:28", "title": "Dynamic stimulation of the visual cortex allows blind and sighted people to 'see' shapes", "text": "For most adults who lose their vision, blindness results from damage to the eyes or optic nerve while the brain remains intact. For decades, researchers have proposed developing a device that could restore sight by bypassing damaged eyes and delivering visual information from a camera directly to the brain. In a paper publishing in the journal Cell on May 14, a team of investigators at Baylor College of Medicine in Houston report that they are one step closer to this goal. They describe an approach in which implanted electrodes are stimulated in a dynamic sequence, essentially \"tracing\" shapes on the surface of the visual cortex that participants were able to \"see.\"\n\n\"When we used electrical stimulation to dynamically trace letters directly on patients' brains, they were able to 'see' the intended letter shapes and could correctly identify different letters,\" senior author Daniel Yoshor says. \"They described seeing glowing spots or lines forming the letters, like skywriting.\"\n\nPrevious attempts to stimulate the visual cortex have been less successful. Earlier methods treated each electrode like a pixel in a visual display, stimulating many of them at the same time. Participants could detect spots of light but found it hard to discern visual objects or forms. \"Rather than trying to build shapes from multiple spots of light, we traced outlines,\" says first author Michael Beauchamp. \"Our inspiration for this was the idea of tracing a letter in the palm of someone's hand.\"\n\nThe investigators tested the approach in four sighted people who had electrodes implanted in their brains to monitor epilepsy and two blind people who had electrodes implanted over their visual cortex as part of a study of a visual cortical prosthetic device. Stimulation of multiple electrodes in sequences produced perceptions of shapes that subjects were able to correctly identify as specific letters.\n\nThe approach, the researchers say, demonstrates that it could be possible for blind people to regain the ability to detect and recognize visual forms by using technology that inputs visual information directly into the brain, should they wish to. The researchers note, however, that several obstacles must be overcome before this technology could be implemented in clinical practice.\n\n\"The primary visual cortex, where the electrodes were implanted, contains half a billion neurons. In this study we stimulated only a small fraction of these neurons with a handful of electrodes,\" Beauchamp says. \"An important next step will be to work with neuroengineers to develop electrode arrays with thousands of electrodes, allowing us to stimulate more precisely.

Older people are more at risk of sustaining them from strokes or falls, while for younger age groups, major causes include road traffic accidents and injuries from sports such as rugby, US-style football and other contact games.\n\nThe high-profile example of Formula 1 racing driver Michael Schumacher demonstrates the difficulties physicians currently face in treating such injuries. After falling and hitting his head on a rock while skiing in Switzerland in 2013, Schumacher developed a swelling on his brain from water rushing into the affected cells. He spent six months in a medically-induced coma and underwent complex surgery, but his rehabilitation continues to this day.\n\nThe new treatment, developed by an international team of scientists working at Aston University (UK), Harvard Medical School (US), University of Birmingham (UK), University of Calgary (Canada), Lund University (Sweden), Copenhagen University (Denmark) and University of Wolverhampton (UK), features in the latest edition of the scientific journal Cell.\n\nThe researchers used an already-licensed anti-psychotic medicine -- trifluoperazine (TFP) -- to alter the behaviour of tiny water channel 'pores' in cells known as aquaporins.\n\nadvertisement\n\nTesting the treatment on injured rats, they found those animals given a single dose of the drug at the trauma site recovered full movement and sensitivity in as little as two weeks, compared to an untreated group that continued to show motor and sensory impairment beyond six weeks after the injury.\n\nThe treatment works by counteracting the cells' normal reaction to a loss of oxygen in the CNS -- the brain and spinal cord -- caused by trauma. Under such conditions, cells quickly become 'saltier' because of a build-up of ions, causing a rush of water through the aquaporins which makes the cells swell and exerts pressure on the skull and spine. This build-up of pressure damages fragile brain and spinal cord tissues, disrupting the flow of electrical signals from the brain to the body and vice versa.\n\nBut the scientists discovered that TFP can stop this from happening. Focusing their efforts on important star-shaped brain and spinal cord cells called astrocytes, they found TFP prevents a protein called calmodulin from binding with the aquaporins. Normally, this binding effect sends the aquaporins shooting to the surface of the cell, letting in more water. By halting this action, the permeability of the cells is reduced.\n\nTraditionally, TFP has been used to treat patients with schizophrenia and other mental health conditions. Its long-term use is associated with adverse side effects, but the researchers said their experiments suggested that just a single dose could have a significant long-lasting impact for CNS edema patients.\n\nSince TFP is already licensed for use in humans by the US Federal Drug Administration (FDA) and UK National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (NICE) it could be rapidly deployed as a treatment for brain injuries. But the researchers stressed that further work would allow them to develop new, even better medicines based on their understanding of TFP's properties.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAccording to the World Health Organisation (WHO), each year around 60 million people sustain a traumatic brain or spinal cord injury and a further 15 million people suffer a stroke. These injuries can be fatal or lead to long-term disability, psychiatric disorders, substance abuse or self-harm.\n\nProfessor Roslyn Bill of the Biosciences Research Group at Aston University said:\n\n\"Every year, millions of people of all ages suffer brain and spinal injuries, whether from falls, accidents, road traffic collisions, sports injuries or stroke. To date, their treatment options have been very limited and, in many cases, very risky.\n\n\"This discovery, based on a new understanding of how our cells work at the molecular level, gives injury victims and their doctors hope. By using a drug already licensed for human use, we have shown how it is possible to stop the swelling and pressure build-up in the CNS that is responsible for long-term harm.\n\n\"While further research will help us to refine our understanding, the exciting thing is that doctors could soon have an effective, non-invasive way of helping brain and spinal cord injury patients at their disposal.\"\n\nDr Zubair Ahmed of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Inflammation and Ageing said:\n\n\"This is a significant advance from current therapies, which only treat the symptoms of brain and spinal injuries but do nothing to prevent the neurological deficits that usually occur as a result of swelling. The re-purposed drug offers a real solution to these patients and can be fast-tracked to the clinic.\"\n\nDr Alex Conner of the University of Birmingham's Institute of Clinical Sciences said:\n\n\"It is amazing that our work studying tiny water channels in the brain can tell us something about traumatic brain swelling that affects millions of people every year.\"\n\nDr Mootaz Salman, Research Fellow in Cell Biology at Harvard Medical School, said:\n\n\"This novel treatment offers new hope for patients with CNS injuries and has huge therapeutic potential.

Mice who switched to standard diet alone gradually saw their body weight, fat composition and blood sugar levels return to normal.\n\nThe mice in the remaining two groups, with either a low or high dose of disulfiram added to their still-fatty food, showed a dramatic decrease in their weight and related metabolic damage. Mice on the high disulfiram dose lost as much as 40% of their body weight in just four weeks, effectively normalizing their weight to that of obese mice who were switched back to standard diet. Mice in either disulfiram dose diet group became leaner and showed significant improvement in blood glucose levels on par with the mice who were returned to standard diet. Disulfiram treatment, which has few harmful side effects in humans, also appeared to protect the pancreas and liver from damage caused by pre-diabetic type metabolic changes and fat build up usually caused by eating a high-fat diet.\n\nThe NIA scientists, Michel Bernier, Ph.D., and Rafael de Cabo, Ph.D., collaborate frequently with researchers at NIH and beyond on studies into how changes in dietary patterns like intermittent fasting could lead to cognitive and physical health benefits. They first became interested in disulfiram after reading about the benefits this class of drug has shown in treating type 2 diabetes in rats, coupled with the growing interest in repurposing drugs that may also improve healthy aging.\n\n\"When we first went down this path, we did not know what to expect, but once we started to see data showing dramatic weight loss and leaner body mass in the mice, we turned to each other and couldn't quite believe our eyes,\" Bernier said.\n\nAccording to study's research team, the key to the positive results seem to stem from disulfiram's anti-inflammatory properties, which helped the mice avoid imbalances in fasting glucose and protected them from the damage of fatty diet and weight gain while improving metabolic efficiency. Both groups of obese mice (control and disulfiram) were not subjected to any form of exercise, nor did they demonstrate noticeable spontaneous behavioral changes. Based on the evidence they observed, the researchers believe the beneficial results of disulfiram stem solely from the drug. They did not observe any negative side effects from disulfiram in the mice.\n\nThe research team stresses that these results are based on animal studies, and they cannot be extrapolated to any potential benefits for human at this point. It is recommended that disulfiram not be used off-label for weight management outside of the context of clinical trials. Still, given the findings, they are planning future steps for studying disulfiram's potential, including a controlled clinical study to test if it could help individuals with morbid obesity lose weight, as well as deeper investigation into the drug's molecular mechanisms and potential for combining with other therapeutic interventions.\n\nThe research was supported by NIA through its intramural research program, NIA grants AG031782 and AG038072, in collaboration with colleagues from the National Institute of Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism, Yale University, Albert Einstein College of Medicine, Korea Research Institute of Bioscience and Biotechnology, and University of Sydney, Australia.\n\nThis press release describes a basic research finding.

However, when paired together, dephostatin allowed for drastically lower concentrations of colistin in a treatment regimen for Salmonella infection in mice that maintained the antibiotic's effectiveness.\n\nThe study details are published in Cell Chemical Biology.\n\n\"The rise of antibiotic resistance has ushered in the post-antibiotic age, and alternatives to antibiotics are urgently required,\" said Caressa Tsai, first author of the study and a PhD student in biochemistry and biomedical sciences in the Coombes lab at McMaster. \"Solving the antibiotic resistance crisis will require us to shift away from the traditional view of antibiotic discovery.\"\n\nThe World Health Organization has classified antibiotic-resistant Salmonella, which can cause infection from eating contaminated foods, as a high-priority pathogen.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn their study, researchers found that dephostatin does not kill Salmonella or stop it from growing. Instead, dephostatin prevents Salmonella from causing infection in two ways: It blocks its ability to resist being killed by immune cells and it enhances its sensitivity to colistin.\n\nWhile the initial findings were done using a method of experimentation called high-throughput screening, the researchers were excited to find that co-administering dephostatin and colistin in mice with a lethal Salmonella infection significantly prolonged animal survival and used a lower concentration of colistin than is normally required for treatment, thereby reducing its toxic effect.\n\nBy the numbers, treatment with colistin alone extended survival of almost 88 per cent of mice to approximately five days post infection and 25 per cent of mice survived to the end of the experiment. However, more than 62 per cent of mice treated with both dephostatin and colistin survived the infection, indicating a significant improvement over therapy with one antibiotic.\n\n\"Traditional antibiotics all work in a similar way -- they clear infections by killing bacteria,\" said Tsai. \"Here, we were interested in a different approach -- keeping bacteria alive, but chemically inactivating important pathways to prevent them from causing infection.\"\n\nResearchers are continuing their research to understand how dephostatin works against Salmonella. Their ongoing work will explore the activity of dephostatin alone and in combination therapies during the treatment of infected animals.\n\n\"Dephostatin appears to knock out two important regulatory pathways that control Salmonella virulence and antibiotic resistance mechanisms,\" said Coombes, corresponding author and a professor in the Department of Biochemistry and Biomedical Sciences at McMaster University.

These vitamins are precursors for NAD+, a molecular switch of metabolism between fasting and growth modes.\n\nAs fasting has been shown promote health and longevity in for example mice, a variety of \"NAD boosters\" are being developed.

But it's too early to claim that the issue is solved. Poached reptiles are largely destined not only for the pet trade, but also folk medicines and snake charmer shows, according to the recent study led by the scientists from the Pakistan Museum of Natural History and the University of Peshawar published in the open-access journal Herpetozoa.\n\nFor the first time, the exploitation of reptiles for the pet trade has come to the attention of the public in the late 1960s. In general, illegal poaching is one of the problems we still face a lot all over the world, despite strict restrictions which are coming in force massively over the last decades. The wildlife trade leads not only to biodiversity loss (through the capture of protected species), but also threatens with a possible spread of animal-borne diseases, due to interspecies contact at pet and folk medicine markets. The case of the recent COVID-19 pandemic gives a lesson to learn, and in order to stop further occurrences, a focus on law-enforcement activities should be brought to wildlife trade hotspots.\n\nIn the particular case of Pakistan, a country with high species diversity of reptiles, still very little is known about the links between illegal wildlife trade and wildlife decline. The illegal poaching and trade in Pakistan are largely undocumented and it's difficult to bring accurate data since the trade involves many channels and follows informal networks. There is marginal information available about the medicinal use of wild flora and fauna for some parts of Pakistan, but there is no report on the commercialisation, harvest, market dynamics and conservation impact of these activities.\n\nSince 2013, a number of confiscations of different reptile species and their parts from Pakistani nationals have been reported widely from across the country, which resulted in the enforcement of legislations regarding the wildlife trade in Pakistan.\n\nAn international team of researchers, led by Dr. Rafaqat Masroor from Pakistan Museum of Natural History investigated the extent of illegal reptile collection in southwestern Balochistan. Scientists tried to determine what impact these activities might have on the wild populations.\n\nThe field trips, conducted in 2013-2017, targeted Chagai, Nushki, Panjgur, Kharan and Washuk districts in Balochistan province. Over those years, scientists interviewed 73 illegal collectors. Most of the collectors worked in groups, consisting of males aged between 14 to 50 years.\n\n\"They were all illiterate and their sole livelihood was based on reptile poaching, trade, and street shows. These collectors were well-organized and had trapping equipment for the collection of reptiles. [...] These groups were locally known as \"jogeez,\" who mainly originated from Sindh Province and included snake charmers, having their roots deep with the local hakeems (herbal medicine practitioners) and wildlife traders, businessmen and exporters based at Karachi city. [...] We often observed local people killing lizards and snakes, mostly for fear of venom and part for fun and centuries-old myths,\" share Dr. Masroor.\n\nA total number of illegally poached reptiles, recorded during the investigation, results in 5,369 specimens representing 19 species. All of them had already been declared Protected under Schedule-III of the Balochistan Provincial Wildlife Act.\n\nAmongst the reasons for the province of Balochistan to remain unexplored might have been the lack of government environmental and wildlife protection agencies, lack of resources and specialists of high qualification in the provincial wildlife, forest and environment departments, as well as geopolitical position and remoteness of vast tracts of areas.\n\nScientists call for the provincial and federal government to take action and elaborate a specific strategy for the conservation of endemic and threatened species as a part of the country's natural heritage both in southwestern Balochistan and whole Pakistan. The conservation plan needs to be consulted with specialists in the respective fields, in order to avoid incompetence.\n\nAlso, the research group suggests to strictly ban illegal poaching of venomous snakes for the purpose of venom extraction.\n\nWhat is important to remember is that Balochistan represents one of the most important areas of Asia with a high number of endemic reptile species. The illegal capture of these species presents a threat to the poorly documented animals. Even though the current trend for captured reptiles is decreasing, more actions are needed, in order to ensure the safety of the biodiversity of the region.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514115756.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T16:57:56", "title": "The revolt of the plants: The Arctic melts when plants stop breathing", "text": "The vapor that plants emit when they breathe serves to lower the land surface temperature, much like watering the yard on a hot day. Until now, the greenhouse effect has been blamed for the rise in global temperature. But an interesting study has shown that the Artic temperature rises when the moisture released by plants is reduced due to the increase of carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) in the atmosphere.\n\nThe joint research team led by Professor Jong-Seong Kug and doctoral candidate So Won Park of POSTECH's Division of Environmental Science and Engineering, and Researcher Jin-Soo Kim of the University of Zurich has confirmed that the increase in atmospheric CO 2 concentration closes the pores (stomata) of plants in high-latitude areas and reduces their transpiration, which ultimately accelerates Arctic warming. The findings, which were studied through the Earth system models (ESM) simulations, were recently published in Nature Communications, an authoritative journal in science.\n\nPlants take in CO 2 and emit oxygen through photosynthesis. During this process, the stomata of leaves open to absorb CO 2 in the air and release moisture at the same time.\n\nHowever, when the CO 2 concentration rises, plants can absorb enough CO 2 without opening their stomata widely. If the stomata open narrowly, the amount of water vapor released also decreases. When this transpiration of plants declines, the land temperature rapidly rises under greenhouse warming. Recently, such a decrease in transpiration has been cited as one of the reasons for the surge in heat waves in the northern hemisphere.\n\nThis response from the vegetation leads to the global climate change by controlling the exchange of energy between the surface and atmosphere, referred to as 'physiological forcing.' But so far, no study has confirmed the effects of physiological forcing on the Arctic climate system.\n\nThe joint research team analyzed the EMS simulation and confirmed that the increase in CO 2 leads to stomatal closure in land vegetation causing land warming, which in turn remotely speeds up Artic warming through an atmospheric circulation and positive feedback in Earth systems process.\n\nIn addition, a quantitative estimate of the stomatal closure's effect on Arctic warming due to increased CO 2 showed that about 10% of the greenhouse effect is caused by this physiological forcing.\n\nProfessor Jong-Seong Kug, who has studied Arctic warming in a variety of perspectives, commented, \"The stomatal closure effect due to the increased CO 2 levels is not fully counted in the future climate projection.\" He pointed out, \"This means that Arctic warming can proceed much faster than current forecast.\" He also warned that \"the increase in CO 2 is accelerating global warming not only through the greenhouse effect that we all knew of, but also by changing the physiological function of plants.\"\n\nThis research was financially supported by the climate feedback research in the land-ocean biogeochemistry division of the National Research Foundation of Korea.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514115751.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T16:57:51", "title": "TRAPPIST-1 planetary orbits not misaligned: First scientific result by the new spectrograph on the Subaru telescope", "text": "Astronomers using the Subaru Telescope have determined that the Earth-like planets of the TRAPPIST-1 system are not significantly misaligned with the rotation of the star. This is an important result for understanding the evolution of planetary systems around very low-mass stars in general, and in particular the history of the TRAPPIST-1 planets including the ones near the habitable zone.\n\nStars like the Sun are not static, but rotate about an axis. This rotation is most noticeable when there are features like sunspots on the surface of the star. In the Solar System, the orbits of all of the planets are aligned to within 6 degrees with the Sun's rotation. In the past it was assumed that planetary orbits would be aligned with the rotation of the star, but there are now many known examples of exoplanet systems where the planetary orbits are strongly misaligned with the central star's rotation. This raises the question: can planetary systems form out of alignment, or did the observed misaligned systems start out aligned and were later thrown out of alignment by some perturbation? The TRAPPIST-1 system has attracted attention because it has three small rocky planets located in or near the habitable zone where liquid water can exist. The central star is a very low-mass and cool star, called an M dwarf, and those planets are situated very close to the central star. Therefore, this planetary system is very different from our Solar System. Determining the history of this system is important because it could help determine if any of the potentially habitable planets are actually inhabitable. But it is also an interesting system because it lacks any nearby objects which could have perturbed the orbits of the planets, meaning that the orbits should still be located close to where the planets first formed. This gives astronomers a chance to investigate the primordial conditions of the system.\n\nBecause stars rotate, the side rotating into view has a relative velocity towards the viewer, while the side rotating out of view has a relative velocity away from the viewer. If a planet transits, passes between the star and the Earth and blocks a small portion of the light from the star, it is possible to tell which edge of the star the planet blocks first. This phenomenon is called the Rossiter-McLaughlin effect. Using this method, it is possible to measure the misalignment between the planetary orbit and the star's rotation. However, until now those observations have been limited to large planets such as Jupiter-like or Neptune-like ones.\n\nA team of researchers, including members from the Tokyo Institute of Technology and the Astrobiology Center in Japan, observed TRAPPIST-1 with the Subaru Telescope to look for misalignment between the planetary orbits and the star. The team took advantage of a chance on August 31, 2018, when three of the exoplanets orbiting TRAPPIST-1 transited in front of the star in a single night. Two of the three were rocky planets near the habitable zone. Since low-mass stars are generally faint, it had been impossible to probe the stellar obliquity (spin-orbit angle) for TRAPPIST-1. But thanks to the light gathering power of the Subaru Telescope and high spectral resolution of the new infrared spectrograph IRD, the team was able to measure the obliquity. They found that the obliquity was low, close to zero. This is the first measurement of the stellar obliquity for a very low-mass star like TRAPPIST-1 and also the first Rossiter-McLaughlin measurement for planets in the habitable zone.\n\nHowever the leader of the team, Teruyuki Hirano at the Tokyo Institute of Technology, cautions, \"The data suggest alignment of the stellar spin with the planetary orbital axes, but the precision of the measurements was not good enough to completely rule out a small spin-orbit misalignment. Nonetheless, this is the first detection of the effect with Earth-like planets and more work will better characterize this remarkable exoplanet system.\"", "author": []}]}, "economist_business": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/business-finance/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/business", "articles": []}, "economist_science_and_tech": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/science-technology/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/science", "articles": []}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-close-are-we-to-herd-immunity/", "published": "2020-05-15T15:33:54", "title": "How Close Are We To Herd Immunity?", "text": "This week on FiveThirtyEight\u2019s COVID-19 podcast, PODCAST-19, we hear some good news about COVID-19 antibodies both in humans and \u2026 llamas?!

Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.", "text": "Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.\n\nWelcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nSo far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it\u2019s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.\n\nAccording to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, \u201cWe are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,\u201d which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.\n\nThe polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month\u2019s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week\u2019s YouGov/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality \u2014 including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats \u2014 believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.\n\nConcerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.\n\nAnd the share of Americans who say they\u2019re concerned about the virus\u2019s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same \u2014 hovering at around 87 percent \u2014 for the past six weeks.\n\nThe share of Americans who approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he\u2019s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.\n\nAttitudes toward Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however \u2014 according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials\u2019 work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.\n\nHowever, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places \u2014 despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they\u2019re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn\u2019t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nAccording to a Morning Consult/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).\n\n71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later). A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was \u201csomething from nature\u201d or \u201ccreated by people, on purpose,\u201d with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.\n\nHalf of Americans said they would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn\u2019t use such a system, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they\u2019d be likely to use it.\n\nAn SSRS/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.\n\nAccording to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.\n\nGeneric ballot\n\nIn our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).\n\nCheck out all the polls we\u2019ve been collecting ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nCORRECTION (May 15, 2020, 10:01 a.m.): A previous version of this article reversed President Trump\u2019s job approval numbers: 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 52.0 percent disapprove, not the other way around.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does The U.S. Have A Coronavirus Recovery Plan?", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/infectious-disease-experts-think-washington-states-slow-reopening-will-mean-fewer-cases/", "published": "2020-05-14T11:00:20", "title": "Infectious-Disease Experts Think Washington State\u2019s Slow Reopening Will Mean Fewer Cases", "text": "On Wednesday, the total number of COVID-19 cases stood at 1,382,304, with deaths at 78,343.

Last week, the experts nailed their forecast: The expert consensus was that on May 10 there would be between 1.3 million and 1.45 million confirmed positive cases reported by The COVID Tracking Project. The actual number reported on May 10 was 1,322,807.\n\nThis week\u2019s expert consensus puts the most probable range at somewhere between 1.45 and 1.55 million total confirmed cases on May 17. But the expert consensus also assigned a 10 percent probability to a more pessimistic scenario \u2014 one in which there are more than 1.6 million cases.\n\nHow many deaths in Pennsylvania on June 13?\n\nWith the president attempting to pressure Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf into reopening his state more quickly, there is increasing tension between the governor\u2019s three-phase plan and some counties\u2019 desires to open up faster. There have been 58,698 total cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, and the current death toll stands at 3,943. The experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths in the state on June 13. The consensus projection was 7,239 dead, with an 80 percent chance that the actual number will fall between 5,249 and 10,472.\n\nOne expert even believes that the death count could plausibly reach 30,000 in the Keystone State, though that view is not shared by the rest of the panel.\n\nHow many new daily cases in Washington?\n\nEven as it extended its stay-at-home orders through the end of the month, Washington state has begun a four-phase reopening plan that Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s administration is calling \u201cSafe Start.\u201d The state plans to remain in each phase for a minimum of three weeks. The first phase of Safe Start allows for some recreation and construction activity, along with auto sales and commercial pet walking. At the time of the survey, five counties with fewer than 75,000 residents and no new reported cases in the past three weeks were allowed to begin Phase 2, which allows the resumption of activity in restaurants, house cleaning services and hair and nail salons, among other businesses.\n\nThe experts were asked to forecast the average new cases per day in Washington for the first week of June. Their consensus estimate of 332 is in line with case counts near the peak of the outbreak in late March and early April, with an 80 percent chance that the actual daily average will fall between 158 and 644 cases.\n\nExperts were also asked to estimate the average daily case count in the first week of June if all Washington counties were allowed to enter Phase 2 on May 16. They forecast an average of 554 new daily cases under such a plan \u2014 an increase of 67 percent over their estimate of cases under the current plan.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this prediction is that 554 average new daily cases is more than the 441 new cases on March 23, which is thus far the highest number of new cases reported in a single day. Since the experts were asked to predict the average number of new daily cases over the course of a week, they appear quite pessimistic about the effects of an early rollout of Washington\u2019s Phase 2 plan.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/without-a-vaccine-herd-immunity-wont-save-us/", "published": "2020-05-13T10:58:39", "title": "Without A Vaccine, Herd Immunity Won\u2019t Save Us", "text": "Daniel Arlein has already had COVID-19. In March, the 36-year-old small business owner and DJ, who lives in Brooklyn, tested positive for the viral infection and suffered through two weeks of flu-like symptoms.\n\nArlein has since recovered, and while he\u2019s still being careful \u2014 avoiding leaving the house, washing his hands more often and wearing a face mask \u2014 he can\u2019t help feeling a bit relieved to have already had the infection.\n\n\u201cThe only way it\u2019s helping me is psychologically, to be able to go out in the world and still be careful but not be freaked out that I\u2019m going to get sick,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no idea if I will get sick again. I feel like I won\u2019t, but I have no idea if I can get it again.\u201d\n\nMost people understand immunity to mean that once a person has been exposed to a disease, they can\u2019t get it again. It\u2019s an easy concept to grasp, and some people have hoped that widespread immunity could be the way out of this pandemic: If enough of the population becomes immune to the disease, the spread would be stopped, since the virus would run out of new, susceptible targets. The \u201cherd\u201d of immune people would protect everyone.\n\nBut getting to herd immunity without a vaccine isn\u2019t as simple as the idea itself. A number of variables can affect when herd immunity is reached \u2014 and what it costs to get there \u2014 and they vary depending on the disease. How infectious is the disease? How deadly is it? And how long do people stay immune once they\u2019ve gotten it? Adjusting any of these variables can drastically change the outcome of this equation. You can probably sense where this is heading \u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve built a very simplified version of how those variables interact. (You\u2019ll see just how simple in the methodology beneath the simulator.) To be clear, this is not about COVID-19 itself \u2014 instead, our calculator shows how a theoretical disease we\u2019re calling Fictionitis would play out in a population that has never encountered it before and does nothing to try to stop it.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that each variable plays a role in setting a herd immunity threshold and reaching it.\n\nThe more people a person with Fictionitis infects on average, the higher the herd immunity threshold rises, but the faster spread also means that the threshold is reached more quickly. That, of course, can lead to a huge portion of the population getting ill at once, which would overwhelm hospitals. Unless the death rate is extremely low, that would be a devastating mix. A disease that doesn\u2019t spread as readily will stick around for longer, but it helps maintain a flatter curve.\n\nIf you shortened the immunity duration, you may have also seen that the blue bar showing how much of the population is susceptible rose again even after the herd immunity threshold had been crossed. That\u2019s because if immunity fades while the disease is still active, people who were previously immune once again become at risk for infection. Herd immunity only truly works while the recovered population has immunity to the disease.\n\nFor COVID-19, of course, we can\u2019t change these variables, and we still haven\u2019t nailed down their exact values, anyway. What we do know so far paints a stark picture: This disease is too deadly, too contagious and too new to depend on post-infection immunity (as opposed to immunity via vaccination) as a solution. Naturally acquired herd immunity is not the answer.\n\nWhat is herd immunity?\n\nIf everyone in a population is immune to the infection, it can\u2019t spread. But we can prevent a disease\u2019s spread even without everyone being immune. If enough people are immune, the infection is unlikely to spread to big swaths of vulnerable people because those who are immune, the \u201cherd,\u201d protect them. The more people who are immune, the more likely it is that infectious people will only come into contact with people who cannot be infected, ending the spread. This creates a societal barrier between the infectious and the vulnerable.\n\nThe moment when herd immunity kicks in depends on how contagious the pathogen is, which is measured by what experts call the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced \u201cR naught\u201d). The R0 is simply the average number of people an infectious person will spread the disease to in a population where no one is immune, so an R0 of 3 would mean an infected person spreads the disease to, on average, three other people while they\u2019re contagious.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThe higher the R0, the higher the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to stop its spread. This is known as the herd immunity threshold, and the formula for finding it is actually pretty straightforward: 1 \u2013 1/R0. For a really contagious disease like measles, which has an R0 between 12 and 18, 93 to 95 percent of the population needs to be immune to stop the spread (this is why the U.S. has had recent measles outbreaks when vaccination rates dropped even slightly).\n\n\u201cThe higher the proportion in a population that is infected, the fewer places there are for that virus to go, the fewer people are susceptible to being transmitted,\u201d said Greta Bauer, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Western University in Ontario, Canada. \u201cThat makes sense, right? If one person, on average, infects two other people but half the population is immune, they\u2019re only going to be able to infect one other person.\u201d\n\nFor COVID-19, we\u2019re still not certain what the R0 is, so we don\u2019t yet know what the herd immunity threshold is. For now, it\u2019s estimated to be anywhere from 70 to 90 percent. But here\u2019s the problem: To reach even the lower end of that range naturally in the U.S. \u2014 imagine giving up on any interventions and just letting the disease run its course \u2014 230 million Americans would eventually become infected and, depending on the fatality rate (more on that later), millions could die.\n\nAnd reaching herd immunity as the outbreak is raging is a completely different scenario than, for example, doing so after a vaccine has been created. With a vaccine, you can immunize people before they\u2019ve encountered the virus, so by the time the virus gets to a vaccinated population, it has nowhere to spread. But in an active outbreak, even once the herd immunity threshold is reached, the infection keeps going. It takes time for the spread of the disease to crest because, for a while at least, many contagious people will each still infect a small number of vulnerable people, which means even more people will get sick and die. It\u2019s a phenomenon known as \u201covershoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disease sort of stops increasing at the point when you reach herd immunity, but there\u2019s still lots and lots of people infected. It only slowly goes down, and on its way down, [it] infects another third of the population,\u201d said Richard Neher, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \u201cIf you drive a car and suddenly you switch off the engine, it doesn\u2019t stop instantly.\u201d\n\nSo think of crossing the herd immunity threshold as determining the fate of the disease (it\u2019s now bound to die out) rather than its status (it\u2019s dead).\n\nSince the new coronavirus is highly contagious (meaning a large percentage of the population would have to get it to slow its spread), the human toll of reaching herd immunity without a vaccine would be staggering. And that\u2019s assuming that once a person gets sick, they stay immune for a long time. But at this point, we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\n\nHow long are we immune once we\u2019ve had it?\n\nTo reach that herd immunity threshold we either need a vaccine, or we need a lot of people like Arlein who have had the virus and are now immune. Except we don\u2019t actually know if Arlein, or anyone else, is really immune.\n\nTypically, when we encounter a new pathogen, our immune system mounts a defense that includes producing antibodies to fight off the infection. Afterward, some of those antibodies and immune cells hang around, allowing our body to \u201cremember\u201d the offending microbe and more easily fend it off in the future.\n\nMore men than women are dying from COVID-19. Is it biology or behavior? l FiveThirtyEight\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of anything that you or I have been infected with in our lives, our immune system has developed immunity to and remembers,\u201d said Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. \u201cThere are definitely exceptions, but that\u2019s the norm.\u201d\n\nThose exceptions are why experts, including the World Health Organization, can\u2019t presume that having had COVID-19 means you can\u2019t get it again, even though antibodies have been detected in recovered patients.\n\n\u201cThe presence of antibodies, everybody thinks that means immunity, but I study HIV and there\u2019s a huge antibody response to HIV, and it\u2019s never able to neutralize that virus,\u201d Bauer said.\n\nResearchers have begun trying to find out how much protection COVID-19 antibodies give people who\u2019ve recovered from the disease. There\u2019s a chance that the immune response from COVID-19 is enough to prevent someone from getting sick again, but not necessarily from getting infected, which means they could still be contagious to others, according to Crotty.\n\nIt\u2019s likely COVID-19 confers at least some immunity, though. For one, there are no confirmed cases of someone getting COVID-19 twice. Early reports from South Korea drew a lot of attention after patients tested positive for the virus again weeks after having recovered, but researchers later said that dead virus fragments from the original infection likely triggered the positive tests, rather than a second infection. One early study from China \u2014 which has not yet been peer reviewed, so take it with an extra grain of salt \u2014 also measured neutralizing antibodies in 94 percent of patients.\n\nPrevious research done on similar coronaviruses, like the ones that cause SARS and MERS, also offers some promising signs. In a mouse study testing a SARS vaccine, for example, researchers stimulated an immune response that staved off a dose of the virus.\n\nBut why would we fail to become immune to a disease? There are a few things that could be happening. Our bodies could stop short of completely killing off the virus in the first place, allowing it to lie dormant and reemerge later (that\u2019s the case with HIV). The virus could evolve enough that our old antibodies won\u2019t work anymore, whether we got them from natural exposure or a vaccine (this is what the seasonal flu does, and it\u2019s part of why we need a new vaccine every year). Or the immune response we produce could just fade too quickly, making us susceptible to reinfection almost immediately.\n\nWith the new coronavirus, there\u2019s not much evidence that either of the first two scenarios is in play, but the third possibility \u2014 that our immunity fades quickly \u2014 remains an open question, and one we won\u2019t be able to answer until more time has passed. Coronaviruses also cause common colds, after all, and humans seem perpetually susceptible to those. In one oft-cited study, for example, people were given a dose of a cold-causing coronavirus, got sick and recovered, then were given another dose a year later. Most of the patients got reinfected, showing how quickly their immunity waned. (And most of them didn\u2019t get sick, which opens up a whole new barrel of fun: If COVID-19 works the same way, some people who had the disease and recovered could wind up picking up \u2014 and spreading \u2014 the novel coronavirus again despite not being symptomatic.)\n\n\u201cOne reason is because your immune system just doesn\u2019t remember all things equally, and to some extent that memory is tied to how severe the initial infection was,\u201d Crotty said.\n\nThat said, for SARS and MERS, both of which were also caused by coronaviruses, immune memory cells were detected in patients several years after infection, though because those outbreaks have ended, we don\u2019t know if those immune cells would protect against reinfection.\n\nThe only way to know if COVID-19 immunity lasts for, say, 10 years is to wait until a decade has passed and see if anyone who was infected once ever got reinfected. (We\u2019re just full of good news, aren\u2019t we?)\n\nWho\u2019s had it?\n\nEven if it turns out that infected people become immune for some period of time, we still aren\u2019t close to herd immunity solving our COVID-19 problem for us. So few people have had the disease that we\u2019re nowhere near herd immunity yet, and the fatality rate is so high that closing that gap would be devastating.\n\nEventually, reliable serological tests, which detect antibodies, can be administered to large samples of the population. That will give us a better sense of how many people actually had the infection, and thus the disease\u2019s true fatality rate. There was some hope that these serological surveys would reveal the disease was much more widespread \u2014 and therefore way less deadly \u2014 than we thought. If, for example, you have 50 deaths in a community and 1,000 recorded cases, the fatality rate is 5 percent (50 out of 1,000). But if a serological survey of that community later revealed that there were actually 3,000 cases, that fatality rate drops to 1.7 percent.\n\nUnfortunately, early serological surveys suggest the fatality rate isn\u2019t low enough to offer us much comfort.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been 81,507 deaths as of May 12. For a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, the same as the seasonal flu, we\u2019d have to find out that 81.5 million Americans, or nearly a quarter of the U.S. population, had already had COVID-19. But based on early serological surveys, the World Health Organization says it\u2019s likely that only about 2 to 3 percent of the population has been exposed so far.\n\nSome serological surveys have reported wildly different estimates of how many people may be immune. A recent survey in California, for example, found that something like 2 to 4 percent of the population had antibodies, while studies in Germany and Massachusetts found antibodies in 15 to 30 percent of those tested.\n\nOne reason for these huge variations could be that rates are genuinely higher in hotspots. Indeed, in New York, the hardest-hit city on the planet, as much as 21 percent of the population may have already been exposed, according to preliminary results from a serological survey. But if even in New York, less than a quarter of the population has antibodies, it\u2019s pretty unlikely that levels are nearly that high in the rest of the country. And New York has also seen a huge number of deaths: at least more than 19,563 as of May 12. Even if this early estimate is correct and 21 percent of New York\u2019s 8.4 million residents have already been infected, that comes out to 1.8 million people, which still puts the current fatality rate at 1.1 percent, or more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cLooking at what percentage of the population might actually have been infected, the numbers of the cases are much higher and the case fatality rate looks like it might be around half a percent,\u201d said Jeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a trivial number, it\u2019s minuscule.\u2019 But, when you think about, say, the population of the United States, 0.5 percent is a tremendous number, and these are people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe other potential explanation for why those serology survey results are all over the map is there may be problems with the way they were conducted. None of the papers mentioned above have been published in peer-reviewed journals yet, and many experts have raised concerns about false positives and how people were recruited for studies, suggesting even these low levels might be overestimating the true prevalence of the disease.\n\nSo let\u2019s go back to that 70 percent herd immunity threshold. If the fatality rate is around 0.5 percent and 70 percent of Americans have to get sick before their immunity starts protecting others, that means more than 1.1 million people would die. In New York, even having 21 percent of the population exposed, if that serological survey is accurate, has overrun hospitals and led to the death of one in every 400 New Yorkers, while the vast majority of the population remains susceptible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the cost of getting to 20 percent,\u201d said Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral epidemiology researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \u201cIt really illustrates the price you\u2019re going to pay if you want to get up to the 60 percent or 70 percent that you\u2019ll need for herd immunity, and I hope it really illustrates why that just isn\u2019t a feasible plan.\u201d", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Julia Wolfe", "Laura Bronner"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/more-men-than-women-are-dying-from-covid-19-is-it-biology-or-behavior/", "published": "2020-05-11T21:51:51", "title": "More Men Than Women Are Dying From COVID-19.

Blue states, such as Washington and New York, were initially hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis, and stay-at-home orders went into effect as early as March 19 (California was first out of the gate). A number of red states have refrained from implementing such public-safety orders, and many Republican-leaning states, particularly in the South, didn\u2019t issue orders for weeks afterward \u2014 as late as April 3 in Florida and Georgia. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis waffled over closing the state but eventually did so under pressure from state lawmakers.\n\nBut, at least on the front end of this crisis, Americans weren\u2019t deciding what to do based on politics. Americans living in red states appear to have taken the crisis plenty seriously; data shows that residents there were staying home well before their governors issued stay-at-home orders.\n\nCuebiq, a private data company, assessed the movement of people via GPS-enabled mobile devices across the U.S. If you look at movement data in a cross-section of states President Trump won in the southeast in 2016 \u2014 Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Kentucky \u2014 23 percent of people were staying home on average during the first week of March. That proportion jumped to 47 percent a month later across these six states.\n\nIf defying social distancing orders were really a political statement, you\u2019d think that the southeast would be a hotbed for dissent. Yet people in the six states we examined changed their behavior around mid-March, before the states\u2019 official stay-at-home orders. In fact, about 90 percent of the total change between early March and mid-April had occurred in the week before the stay-at-home orders were passed in each state.\n\nThat\u2019s more or less in line with the country at large, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nAlmost uniformly across these states, people started staying home beginning on March 14. The percentage of people staying home rose rapidly over the following nine days and tended to plateau by March 23.\n\nThe Cuebiq data suggests that behavioral changes were largely driven by people making a voluntary choice to stay home rather than being forced to do so by a state-sanctioned stay-at-home order. One need only look at the behavior of residents in North Carolina and their neighbors in South Carolina: While North Carolina issued a stay-at-home order eight days before South Carolina, a stabilized number of people in both states started staying at home about a week before North Carolina\u2019s order.\n\nWhy did people begin to stay at home so early? In mid-March, the seriousness of the virus had begun to permeate the national and international conversation. On March 9, the Dow dropped to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier that same day, Italy announced a nationwide lockdown. On March 11, the NBA announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely, a sign to many Americans that the pandemic would indeed change all facets of life, and on March 12, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Some of the earliest official actions in the U.S. occurred around that time in the state of Washington, when Gov. Jay Inslee announced on March 11 a ban in three counties on gatherings of more than 250 people and public schools in Seattle also announced they would close. Many other U.S. cities closed schools, restaurants and bars in rapid succession around March 16.\n\nThis sort of mass behavioral change in such a short time is significant. It took over 50 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in prevention efforts to lower the percentage of people who smoke in the U.S. from 42 percent in 1965 to 13 percent in 2018. Americans reacted to the threat of COVID-19 in a relative blink of an eye.\n\nThe question that now looms, of course, is whether Americans\u2019 individual behavioral changes will last as the pandemic wears on and the summer sun beckons. We\u2019ll be watching movement data to get a sense of how quickly we will return to normal \u2014 or at least how quickly we establish a new normal.\n\nWhy does COVID-19 make some people sicker than others? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Clare Malone", "Kyle Bourassa"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-not-too-late-for-contact-tracing/", "published": "2020-05-08T15:30:41", "title": "Why It\u2019s Not Too Late For Contact Tracing", "text": "As the U.S. starts to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say we\u2019ll need to track everyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient to stop new chains of infection.

The total count of positive cases now stands at more than 1.2 million, according to numbers from The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nIn our effort to make sense of the range of possible outcomes for the outbreak, we\u2019ve continued to follow the results of a weekly survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the United States. In this week\u2019s survey, conducted May 4 and 5, experts predict that the total number of positive cases in the U.S. will be more than 1.3 million and less than 1.45 million on May 10. The experts also forecast a total of 255,500 deaths attributed to the coronavirus by the end of 2020.\n\nThe survey is organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst.

The reported number of 1,152,006 fell just outside that range, according to The COVID Tracking Project. This week, the researchers were asked to predict the number of confirmed cases by May 10. The expert consensus put the most probable range between 1.3 million and 1.45 million cases. (Like last week, the researchers were given five distinct ranges of total confirmed cases and asked to assign a probability to each bin.)\n\nHow many U.S. jurisdictions will report more new cases in September than in June?\n\nIn a new question, the experts were asked to forecast out to September and predict how many states and territories (plus the District of Columbia) would report more new COVID-19 cases in that month than they did in June. Questions like this require two separate predictions, with one largely conditional on the other. This increases the difficulty and uncertainty of the forecasts.\n\nAccordingly, the distribution of answers given by the experts is more uniform across the range of possible outcomes. But in the mass of uncertainty, there is perhaps some good news: As summer stretches into fall, experts assigned the highest probability to fewer than four states reporting more new coronavirus cases than they had in June.\n\nWhat will happen in Texas?\n\nOn May 1, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott allowed his stay-at-home order to expire. In the most recent seven-day period for which the state is reporting data \u2014 April 30 through May 6 \u2014 the average daily new case count is 1,053. The panel of experts were asked to forecast the average number of new daily cases in Texas during the week ending on June 13.\n\nThe experts predict that the new seven-day daily average in Texas is most likely to rise to between 1,350 and 1,800, affirming the widely held belief that social distancing measures have been effective at containing the spread of the disease. Experts placed a slightly smaller probability on the chances of Texas seeing between 900 and 1,350 new daily cases, on average.\n\nMeanwhile, most experts believe that the average new daily case count would have fallen under the stricter stay-at-home guidelines that Texas previously had in place. The experts forecast a 31 percent probability that the average number of new cases would have been between 675 and 900 had the stay-at-home order not been allowed to expire.\n\nHow many deaths will there be by year\u2019s end?\n\nFinally, the experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 by the end of 2020. The consensus estimate is that 255,500 die, with a 90 percent chance of the death total falling between 118,750 and 1,211,500 \u2014 a large range.\n\nThe low end of the expert\u2019s range may be optimistic, however. The FiveThirtyEight model roundup shows that most models project 100,000 or more deaths by the end of May. Modeling the virus continues to be incredibly challenging, so it\u2019s difficult to know which set of expectations to weight more heavily. But with uncertainty still high and spring in the air, perhaps some optimism in this moment is warranted \u2014 or at least forgivable.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-scientists-think-the-novel-coronavirus-developed-naturally-not-in-a-chinese-lab/", "published": "2020-05-04T19:58:42", "title": "Why Scientists Think The Novel Coronavirus Developed Naturally \u2014 Not In A Chinese Lab", "text": "You could be forgiven for wondering how a disease as fast-moving and deadly as COVID-19 could just appear naturally, out of nowhere, seemingly overnight. President Trump expressed doubt, saying that \u201ca lot of people\u201d were looking at the possibility that a Chinese lab was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier that week, Fox News ran a story in which unnamed sources suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory \u2014 the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses with a number of international collaborators. The New York Times reported that spy agencies are being pressured to find evidence blaming the lab, and at the end of April, the National Institutes of Health withdrew funding from a research consortium that had collaborated with the lab. As recently as this weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, despite saying there was no reason to disbelieve the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the virus was neither manmade nor genetically modified, claimed there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d connecting the virus to the WIV.\n\nBut the truth is almost certainly not that salacious. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, said this dynamic is familiar. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an outbreak, people say, oh, there\u2019s a lab close by.\u201d He should know: In 2014, during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, conspiracy theorists alleged his team\u2019s lab in Sierra Leone, not far from the origin of the outbreak, was a George Soros-funded bioweapons site.\n\nAccording to a growing body of research, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is almost certainly a naturally occurring virus that initially circulated in bats then spilled into humans. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some from trying to find a more sinister origin. \u201cIt seems like such an extreme event that people are looking for an extraordinary explanation for it,\u201d said Stephen Goldstein, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah who studies coronaviruses. No single piece of evidence has yet confirmed the virus\u2019 origin. But according to scientists, the evidence that does exist paints a consistent picture of a wild virus, not one that sprang from a lab.\n\nWhy do scientists think it wasn\u2019t genetically engineered?\n\nTo genetically engineer a new virus, scientists can combine pieces of viruses they\u2019ve seen before. In the case of a genetically engineered coronavirus that was designed to infect humans, the bulk of its genetic material \u2014 its \u201cbackbone\u201d \u2014 would come from SARS or a close relative, while the tools it used to infect cells would be grafted on. But the backbone doesn\u2019t look like any disease-causing virus, and other key parts of the virus are new to science.\n\nIn SARS-CoV-2\u2019s case, scientists thought they knew how to optimize SARS to infect human hosts. Coronaviruses enter host cells using protein \u201cspikes\u201d that cover their outer surface. At the tip of each spike is a cluster of amino acids that can bind to a certain receptor on a host cell, like a pick designed to open a particular cellular lock. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike binds to human ACE2 receptors, which coat lung cells.\n\nThe original SARS coronavirus targeted the same receptors, and after the 2002 SARS epidemic, experiments tinkered with its spike to determine the structure of an \u201coptimized\u201d version of the SARS lock pick. Many factors influence the success of a virus, but its binding ability is thought to be important, so \u201cif you were going to make a new virus, and make it even more infectious than SARS,\u201d said Goldstein, you would give it that optimized tip.\n\nBut, Garry said, the tip of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is unlike anything scientists have seen before, sharing only a single key amino acid with SARS. Modeling suggests that it shouldn\u2019t be able to bind to human lungs well, but the new configuration is about as effective as the optimized SARS.\n\nHow SARS-CoV-2 acquired this unusual tip is still a mystery. But blaming it on genetic engineering overstates the abilities of scientists, Garry said. Guessing that these particular amino acids can bind to ACE2 so effectively is nearly impossible\u2014 there are 20 common types of amino acids, and tens of millions of ways to arrange them into a binding tip. It would be like if you looked out over the proverbial infinite monkeys with their infinite typewriters, guessed that a specific macaque would type out King Lear, and then picked the right animal.\n\n\u201cNobody has that kind of insight into how the viruses evolve or cause disease,\u201d said Garry. \u201cYou could randomly try to make changes, but we\u2019re talking about thousands of years of trying pathogens out. I\u2019ve been really lucky to know a lot of talented virologists, and they\u2019re not clever enough to come up with a virus that\u2019s quite this good at spreading.\u201d\n\nWhat if it was in a petri dish and got out?\n\nAnother theory suggests a researcher at the WIV studying a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally infected.\n\nBut the researchers I spoke to threw cold water on that. \u201cI think it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask these questions and examine all sources of the outbreak,\u201d said Gregory Koblentz, a professor at George Mason University who studies biosecurity. \u201cBut based on what we know of the biology of the virus, a natural source of the outbreak is the most likely explanation.\u201d\n\nThe virus\u2019s spike has a hinge-like structure, allowing the spike to change shape as the virus enters the host cell. Like the spike tip, the hinge on SARS-CoV-2 is markedly different from anything seen in its close relatives. New research suggests that the hinge loses its unique characteristics when cultured in a lab, said Garry. The spike also appears to be able to shield itself from antibodies\u2014another hint that it evolved in the presence of host immune systems.\n\nMost importantly, there\u2019s no smoking gun connecting the lab to an ancestor of the virus. There\u2019s \u201cno bat virus that\u2019s close enough to be the progenitor,\u201d said Garry. The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a cousin that diverged decades ago in bats.\n\nAnd while critics suggest that the WIV might have concealed the ancestral virus, 27 scientists who have collaborated with the WIV, including former U.S. officials, rejected the idea in a letter to The Lancet.\n\nKoblentz agrees there\u2019s not much evidence to suggest a cover-up. \u201cIf the Chinese government suspected that the outbreak was the result of a biosafety breach in Wuhan, I would have expected them to come down very hard on that lab, not letting them talk to foreigners,\u201d he said. But in March, a lead researcher at the WIV talked to Scientific American about her search for the ancestral strain.\n\nThe WIV has released sequences of bat coronavirus in the months since the epidemic started, giving other scientists insight into the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. Several of the early virus genome sequences in an open-source international database were submitted by the WIV, which allowed other countries to begin developing diagnostic tools. That willingness to release data, Koblentz said, could be evidence that weights \u201cthe scale towards [the WIV] being transparent and cooperative.\u201d\n\nThen how\u2019d it get here at all?\n\nThere\u2019s a simpler, if less flashy, explanation for the emergence of a new SARS. A study, published in 2018, of four rural villages in Yunnan province located near caves containing bats known to carry coronaviruses found that 2.7 percent of those surveyed had antibodies for close relatives of SARS. Thousands, if not millions, of people are exposed to wild coronaviruses every year. Most of them aren\u2019t dangerous, but \u201cif you roll the dice enough times,\u201d Goldstein said, you\u2019ll see a bad one.\n\nCritics have raised concerns over biosafety protocols at the WIV, but Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said the criticisms are based on evidence taken out of context. The reports of biosafety issues, she said, are \u201clike having the health inspector come to your restaurant. It could just be, \u2018Oh, you need to keep your chemical showers better stocked.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t suggest, however, that there are tremendous problems.\u201d\n\nAnd Garry reiterated that it\u2019s incredibly unlikely SARS-CoV-2 is the result of a \u201cbad\u201d roll of the dice at the WIV. \u201cAll the natural exposures dwarf the possibility that it was some lab guy that was out catching bats and infected himself. That\u2019s one little thing among millions of encounters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to totally rule out a lab accident, Rasmussen said, but she worries that unilateral, politically charged investigations will permanently damage international scientific collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe live in a global world,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cIt would hurt us tremendously if we were to stop collaborating with Chinese scientists.\u201d The next pandemic is unlikely to come from a lab, just as Ebola, SARS, Zika and avian flu did not, she said. And the U.S. will be much more vulnerable if our epidemiologists face it alone.", "author": ["Philip Kiefer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-crises-and-domestic-violence-and-what-that-could-mean-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-04T11:00:10", "title": "What We Know About Crises And Domestic Violence \u2014 And What That Could Mean For COVID-19", "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, in addition to its direct impact on people\u2019s health, has unleashed a perfect storm of conditions that may increase the rate of domestic violence. Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

On Tuesday, the number of Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 passed 1 million, and on Wednesday, deaths attributed to the disease \u2014 which are probably underestimated \u2014 rose to more than 60,000.\n\nAs the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths continue to grow, we checked back in with a survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the U.S. to help us understand where we might be headed.\n\nFor the week ending April 25, 13,788 deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In this week\u2019s survey, which was conducted on April 27 and 28, a plurality of experts predicted that weekly death totals would not fall below 5,000 until after June 20. The experts also forecast that between 1 million and 1.15 million total confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be reported on May 3.\n\nFor some questions in the survey \u2014 organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst \u2014 respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 3?\n\nThe experts have been asked this question in the past, and actual case numbers have fallen within their forecasted ranges. This time, they were given a set of five bins of predefined total confirmed cases and were asked to assign a probability to each. For the week ending May 3, the expert consensus is that between 1.1 and 1.15 million total confirmed cases will be reported by The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nAs has been true throughout the crisis, however, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the predicted confirmed case count. The consensus forecast says that the chance (about 18 percent) that confirmed cases will be between 1.05 and 1.1 million is the same as the chance it will be above 1.2 million.\n\nWhen will new reported deaths per week drop below 5,000?\n\nIn the past two weeks, deaths attributed to the coronavirus have hovered above 13,700 (13,708 and 13,788). A drop to 5,000 weekly deaths would represent a decline of 64 percent \u2014 a substantial decrease. But experts are pessimistic that such a drop will happen in the near future. The expert consensus gives a nearly 40 percent chance of the U.S. hitting the 5,000-death weekly plateau by June 6 and a probability of just over 60 percent of it occurring some time after then.\n\nWhat will happen in Georgia?\n\nOn April 23, Georgia partially reopened for business, and stay-at-home restrictions have continued to be lifted across the state. The seven-day moving average for newly confirmed cases in the Peach State stood at just over 700 per day on April 20. Experts were asked to predict the new daily case average for the week ending on May 16 under the current open regime, along with the daily case average had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe consensus forecast of 1,044 new confirmed cases per day in two weeks suggests that Georgia will see a substantial worsening of the virus\u2019s spread as a result of reopening. The daily number of new confirmed cases is forecast to be somewhere between 579 and 2,292, with six experts indicating that an increase to 2,000 or more new cases a day is plausible.\n\nExperts believe that the spread of COVID-19 could have been reduced had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home order. Under this scenario, experts predicted that Georgia would have seen only 487 new cases per day for the week ending on May 16, a reduction of more than 50 percent in new daily cases compared with the estimates in the open regime.\n\nThere was also less uncertainty among experts in their predictions for Georgia\u2019s new daily cases in the world where Georgia did not relax stay-at-home orders. Experts would have expected between 273 and 1,156 new cases per day, representing a spread half as large as the one for the new-case forecast without the stay-at-home orders.\n\nAs Americans slowly prepare to go back to work, the experts\u2019 forecast helps quantify the increased risk Georgia and other states have incurred by beginning to restart their economies in the midst of a still-uncontrolled pandemic.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen.

But experts don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the gap. Is it biological, some quirk of cells and hormones? Is it the result of gendered behaviors that have more to do with sociology than sex chromosomes? Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s going on, because experts say men\u2019s risk level depends on what risks (and which men) you\u2019re talking about.\n\nWhat we know\n\nWhile men account for the majority of COVID-19 cases in some countries but a minority of cases in others, they consistently make up the majority of deaths. Out of 35 countries that have reported their COVID deaths in ways that break out victims by sex, 33 had a male-female death ratio greater than 1, meaning men who were confirmed to have the disease were more likely to die than women who were confirmed to have it, according to data compiled by Global Health 50/50, an independent health equity research organization based at University College London. \u201cSo far, the mortality disadvantage for men is quite large,\u201d said Jennifer Dowd, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford.\n\nMen are more likely than women to die of COVID-19 Share of COVID-19 patients who died, by gender Deaths among confirmed cases Country male female ratio Dominican Republic 6.5% 2.1% 3.0 Thailand 2.5 0.9 2.7 Greece 7.8 3.1 2.5 Romania 7.9 3.5 2.3 The Netherlands 18.1 8.1 2.2 Italy 17.1 9.3 1.8 Belgium 15.3 8.6 1.8 Northern Ireland 10.4 5.6 1.8 Spain 10.2 5.8 1.8 Ecuador 6.9 3.9 1.8 Denmark 6.6 3.6 1.8 Argentina 6.3 3.5 1.8 Philippines 8.2 4.9 1.7 China 4.7 2.8 1.7 Sweden 15.1 9.4 1.6 Mexico 10.9 6.9 1.6 Switzerland 6.1 3.7 1.6 Ukraine 3.2 2.0 1.6 South Korea 2.9 1.8 1.6 Indonesia 9.3 6.4 1.5 Republic of Ireland 5.8 3.7 1.5 Colombia 5.4 3.5 1.5 Peru 3.1 2.1 1.5 South Africa 1.7 1.1 1.5 Australia 1.5 1.0 1.5 Portugal 4.7 3.3 1.4 Germany 4.5 3.2 1.4 Canada 4.5 3.6 1.3 Austria 4.1 3.1 1.3 Norway 2.9 2.3 1.3 Finland 3.3 2.8 1.2 Luxembourg 2.6 2.1 1.2 Iran 5.9 5.4 1.1 India 2.6 3.1 0.9 Pakistan 2.0 2.8 0.7 Numbers in this table come from different dates, depending on the country and how frequently it updates its publicly available data. Most of the data is dated to April 26-29, though a few countries\u2019 numbers are from earlier in April. China\u2019s data is from Feb. 28 and Iran\u2019s is from March 17. Source: Global Health 50/50\n\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t new to medicine. \u201cWomen have stronger adaptive immune responses and die less of infectious disease their entire lives, starting from infant mortality,\u201d Dowd said. In general, women\u2019s bodies kick out bacterial and viral invaders faster than men\u2019s do, and vaccines work better for women than for men.\n\nTo see why, look to hormones and genetics, said Sabra Klein, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. Sex hormones appear to play a role determining how well human bodies can fight off disease. In general, estrogens amp up the immune system, while androgens (like testosterone) and progesterone suppress it. Hormones have to interact with cells to do their jobs, Klein said, so cells have a \u201clock\u201d and hormones have the \u201ckey\u201d to get in. And, turns out, every immune cell in your body has these kinds of lock-and-key receptors.\n\nSex chromosomes also play a role. The X chromosome, for example, has 60 genes associated with immune function. Most biological males are born with one X chromosome, but those immune-boosting genes tend to be expressed more frequently in women, who generally have two X chromosomes, Klein said.\n\nBut if you\u2019re tempted to think those sex differences boil down to \u201cmen are more likely to die from infectious disease,\u201d Klein cautioned that the generalization is not true across the board. Sex differentiation in influenza has been pretty well studied, she told me, and, in that case, women\u2019s more aggressive immune systems don\u2019t give us an advantage. Having too much of an inflammatory immune response to the flu can actually increase your risk of complications \u2014 including acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the lungs\u2019 tiny air sacs, called alveoli, are damaged and fill with fluid. \u201cReproductive-age women do worse, not better,\u201d Klein said.\n\nWhat we know we don\u2019t know\n\nBut while researchers know a decent amount about sex differences in influenza, the novel coronavirus is, yes, novel. Any research on it is a work in progress, proceeding without full data. That starts with basic documentation.\n\nOn April 28, the United States had reported 57,318 deaths from the novel coronavirus, but only 31,586 of those deaths had been reported in ways that allowed Global Health 50/50 to break them down by sex. None of the researchers I spoke with knew why that data isn\u2019t getting reported. But without it, they\u2019re left to a lot of guesswork and speculation. It\u2019s safe to assume that deaths in the U.S. are probably following the patterns seen in many other countries \u2014 but we don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s true.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the variations in how this virus affects people probably isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in their chromosomes or hormones. It\u2019s also about sociological gender \u2014 the attitudes, stereotypes and norms that shape the ways people behave and the choices they make.\n\nFor example, a 2016 meta-analysis showed that women are about 50 percent more likely than men to start using non-pharmaceutical protective behaviors during a pandemic \u2014 things like wearing face masks or avoiding public transit. Men, meanwhile, were about 12 percent more likely than women to sign up for vaccines, take antiviral medication, or use other pharmaceutical interventions. Those differences in behavior aren\u2019t determined by biology, but they could help create variations in how a virus affects men and women.\n\nRosemary Morgan, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies how gender and sex interact with public health, thinks these kinds of effects are happening with COVID-19. But how and to what extent \u2014 that\u2019s unknown. It also probably differs from country to country, thanks to the way gender norms also aren\u2019t consistent everywhere you go.\n\nCase in point: When data on sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths first began to come in from China, it wasn\u2019t clear that the differences in death rates there would mean other counties were going to experience the same thing. That\u2019s because China has particularly gendered smoking habits, Dowd told me. In a 2010 study, 54 percent of Chinese men surveyed were current smokers. In contrast, the same study found that less than 3 percent of Chinese women currently smoked. Although sex differences in COVID-19 death rates have cropped up again in other countries, it\u2019s likely that this gender disparity in smoking plays a role in why 64 percent of China\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have been among men even though men account for right around half of China\u2019s confirmed cases.\n\nGender norms may also influence the niches where women are getting the disease more than men, despite men\u2019s higher death rates. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the characteristics of health care workers who have contracted COVID-19, it found that 73 percent were women. Why are female health care workers getting infected at much higher rates? Part of it likely has to do with their higher odds of exposure.\n\nNurses\u2019 jobs put them in close physical contact with patients who have COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and more than 70 percent of nurses are women. Meanwhile, the personal protective equipment meant to help keep medical workers safe often isn\u2019t designed with women in mind. Gloves can be too large. Masks don\u2019t always fit women\u2019s faces with a tight seal. Gender dynamics could be putting a largely female workforce in harm\u2019s way.\n\nIn the end, regardless of your sex \u2014 or your gender \u2014 the risks you face from COVID-19 are probably somewhat unique to you. But if we want to figure out just what, exactly, those risks are, we\u2019re going to need more data.\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-the-united-states-has-gotten-over-the-coronavirus-hump/", "published": "2020-04-27T16:49:26", "title": "Do You Buy That \u2026 The United States Has Gotten Over The Coronavirus Hump?", "text": "Do You Buy That \u2026 The United States Has Gotten Over The Coronavirus Hump?", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/should-we-sacrifice-our-data-privacy-to-fight-the-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-04-24T18:36:13", "title": "Should We Sacrifice Our Data Privacy To Fight The Coronavirus?", "text": "Should We Sacrifice Our Data Privacy To Fight The Coronavirus?\n\nSenior writer Neil Paine looks into how personal data is being used to fight COVID-19 and explores when such measures become too invasive.\n\nRead more from Neil Paine.", "author": ["Neil Paine", "Tony Chow"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-chart-isnt-going-to-tell-you-when-the-pandemic-peaked/", "published": "2020-04-23T21:19:02", "title": "One Chart Isn\u2019t Going To Tell You When The Pandemic Peaked", "text": "These days it seems like you can\u2019t even scroll through goat videos on Twitter without hitting a COVID-19 chart \u2014 and people trying to use the chart to understand whether the epidemic has \u201cpeaked.\u201d\n\nSome good news: This graph shows diagnosed cases statewide over the last couple of weeks.

That curve sure seems like it\u2019s bending! Or, that new case number seems lower than yesterday\u2019s!\n\nBut it\u2019s not that easy. Each chart you see reflects a host of decisions \u2014 which data to chart, which source to use, how to compare countries or states, how to display the data \u2014 that can drastically change what you see and what you can safely take away from the chart. To truly understand whether a place has reached the peak of its infection curve, you need to be a savvy reader of the charts and the underlying data. And, ideally, you need to look at more than one chart.\n\nSo what should you keep in mind when you\u2019re trying to interpret all these data visualizations?\n\nWhat is the chart showing?\n\nBefore you can know whether the chart is showing you a peak, you need to know what data it\u2019s showing you in the first place. Are you looking at total confirmed cases? Total hospitalizations? Total deaths? Or is the chart showing you day-by-day counts? Each of these numbers provide information \u2014 but each is incomplete. And they\u2019re not interchangeable.\n\nConfirmed cases\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to tell whether someplace has hit a peak using a chart of confirmed cases. Obviously, we\u2019d like to see the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus decline. But anytime you see something tracking the number of cases, remember how hugely dependent it is on the number of tests being done. Anyplace that doesn\u2019t test for the coronavirus is not going to find cases. That\u2019s especially true in the U.S., where the number of tests done is reportedly minuscule relative to how many people report symptoms.\n\n\u201cWhen we see a plateau, it may just be because we\u2019ve maxed out our testing capacity rather than a true flattening of incident cases,\u201d said Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. In other words, a flatter curve might just mean that the number of tests is failing to keep up with the number of infections. And as some states look to resume certain economic activities, they may have an incentive to keep testing levels low so the number of cases doesn\u2019t appear to increase.\n\nSo let\u2019s change our understanding of these kinds of charts off the bat: These aren\u2019t visualizations of the number of cases, they\u2019re visualizations of the number of confirmed cases, a number that, in most countries, drastically underestimates the true number of people who are sick.\n\nEven if testing was sufficient, the tests themselves still need to be accurate. There are reports that some tests might have shockingly high rates of false negatives \u2014 that is, people who have the disease but get a negative test result at least some of the time.\n\nEven if all cases were somehow measured, there would still be a lag between when someone is infected and when they get tested. It takes time to develop symptoms (the incubation period), have those symptoms get bad enough to send someone to the doctor for a test, and for the test to come back. While the lag likely differs by person, the numbers on a chart of confirmed cases are (even in the best case) quite out of date.\n\nThis lag is also one reason why charts showing the daily number of new cases can be somewhat misleading. What looks like a change happening that day might actually be reflecting a change that started a week or two ago. And lots of funky things can happen as data is collected and reported that can artificially depress or inflate a day\u2019s tally.\n\nAll of that could be dealt with \u2014 if all those factors stayed constant. That is, if people were generally getting tested at the same point in the course of their illness \u2026 and how health care professionals administered the tests wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 and the tests themselves weren\u2019t changing \u2026 and the delay in reporting results wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 then the trends in confirmed cases would still be informative about the virus\u2019s spread, even though the number of confirmed cases wouldn\u2019t directly reflect the number of infections. We\u2019re just looking for a change in the trend line on the chart, after all.\n\nBut the problem is that we don\u2019t know if any of that is staying constant. So it\u2019s very difficult to glean a useful signal from a metric as noisy as confirmed case counts.\n\nDeaths\n\nSo counting cases is fraught. What about just counting deaths? Surely that\u2019s less questionable, since every place already tracks how many people die there, so those numbers should be more reliable. This might be true \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to be sure.\n\nTo track coronavirus deaths, you still need to confirm that a person who died had COVID-19 \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear that that\u2019s being done. Some people aren\u2019t being tested before or after they die, and COVID-19 may not appear on someone\u2019s death certificate even if it seemed likely they had the disease. For people who don\u2019t die at a hospital, establishing the cause of death might be even more challenging, especially if coronavirus tests are scarce and being reserved for the living. And some countries have changed how they count deaths outside of hospitals as this pandemic has ground on, making it harder to interpret the trend over time.\n\nHospitals and governments also have an incentive to underreport COVID-19 deaths, since fatalities can make those institutions look bad. For instance, the CIA doesn\u2019t believe the Chinese government\u2019s official infection and death tallies.\n\nHospitalizations\n\nAre hospitalizations the most accurate type of data? New York City, for example, has started releasing the number of people who have been hospitalized. Assuming that this data is collected correctly, we might think that this is the chart that would provide us the most reliable trend. If it peaked, then that would seem to be a good indicator that the infection has as well, even if most people with COVID-19 are never hospitalized.\n\nBut what happens if the criteria for hospitalization change as the outbreak progresses? If hospitals increase the threshold for admission as they run out of beds \u2014 if, for example, any shortness of breath was enough to get someone admitted in the early days of the pandemic, but health care workers start turning away those patients as resources get scarcer \u2014 then a chart that shows a plateau in hospitalizations could be a sign of a system approaching capacity rather than (or in addition to!) a change in the number of infections. (The same is true, for instance, if people are increasingly told to avoid hospitals unless absolutely necessary.)\n\nHow is the data being displayed?\n\nThe kind of chart you\u2019re looking at also matters. Peaks are even harder to see if charts use a logarithmic scale, which many COVID-19 visualizations do. Using a log scale means that the chart\u2019s vertical axis doesn\u2019t increase the way you might expect, with the distance between 0 and 1,000 being the same size as the distance between 10,000 and 11,000. Instead, the number multiplies for each equally sized space on the y-axis \u2014 that is, if one space on the y-axis goes from 100 to 1,000, the next space of the same size will go from 1,000 to 10,000, and the one after that will go from 10,000 and 100,000, but the size of the gap between each set of those numbers stays the same even as the numbers jump up by bigger and bigger margins. This kind of trick has several advantages, including that it lets you compare a location\u2019s curve when it has a relatively low number of cases and when it has a high number of cases. (If you have a linear scale, in contrast, showing the top end of the scale necessarily means that small values will be very hard to see.)\n\nOn the other hand, using a log scale also means that once you get to higher values, small-looking fluctuations in case counts can reflect pretty big differences in raw numbers. This makes it even harder to visually draw inferences about peaks from charts.\n\nOf course, all of these concerns are even more serious when the chart shows data from more than one place, regardless of whether what\u2019s being compared are different countries or different states. These kinds of charts have all the same issues as the ones tracking numbers in a single place, but that set of problems is multiplied by the number of places on the chart.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLet\u2019s say that, according to one of the metrics above, the curve does seem to be bending downward. What does that mean? Well, first, you might want to look at the other metrics too. If all three measures \u2014 confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 are going down, and the total number of tests administered hasn\u2019t dropped, that makes it more likely that there really is good news. And a better metric \u2014 though still one with issues \u2014 is the share of positive tests out of all tests administered, which tries to account for testing in some way (though it doesn\u2019t address whether who is being tested is changing). (Though if the number of cases is still growing, even if it\u2019s at a lower rate, that would continue to increase the strain on an already burdened health care system.)\n\nAnd as Joshua Epstein, the director of the New York University Agent-Based Modeling Lab, said in an online seminar: With any infectious disease, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of transmission after the peak.\u201d Reaching the peak on a chart doesn\u2019t mean you can go outside again \u2014 it means that the outbreak is at its worst. Even if it is getting better, you might still need to be extremely careful for a while.\n\nAnd even if you are fully convinced that things are truly improving \u2014 new cases are going down, hospitals are nowhere near overcrowding, and the sick are getting better \u2014 what do you do when restrictions ease? Germany, which tested very high rates of people early on in the outbreak and had relatively low case numbers and deaths, has come up with a plan for gradual reopening. But if the peak has been successfully averted and relatively few people have had the disease, that might mean that a second, potentially larger peak is in the offing. Even after the infection peaks, the danger may be on the rise.\n\nCORRECTION (April 23, 2020, 5:41 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated how the y-axis on a logarithmic chart would look.

Some, though, have a severe, even deadly, case. Why is it that someone who seems healthy and has no underlying conditions could be killed by this virus when so many of their peers pull through just fine? Let\u2019s break down what we know and what research is needed to answer this COVID-19 mystery.\n\nWhat we know\n\nOur understanding of why some people get mild infections while others wind up hospitalized or killed by COVID-19 is still limited. In the U.S., 34 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases are in patients under the age of 45, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from mid-March. Of patients known to be hospitalized, about 20 percent were under 45, and of those known to be admitted to the ICU, 12 percent were under 45. The CDC also reports that the case fatality rate is less than 1 percent for people age 20-54.\n\nBut there isn\u2019t much we know about why some young people are getting extremely sick and others aren\u2019t. We know that age is a risk factor \u2014 the case fatality rate for COVID-19 climbs steeply for patients over 60. This is true for a lot of infections and generally has to do with diminishing immune systems and underlying health conditions.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t help us figure out what\u2019s going on with these cases where young people get sick and it quickly turns serious. It\u2019s not as simple as pointing to underlying conditions. Many conditions, such as asthma, haven\u2019t been definitively confirmed as risk factors, though many doctors suspect they are.\n\n\u201cWe have guesses, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. David Smith, the head of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to figure that out.\u201d\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know (and how we figure it out)\n\nSure, there\u2019s plenty scientists don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what hypotheses are for. Researchers have already begun studies to uncover which factors contribute to a severe or deadly case.\n\nSome are looking into genetic differences. Our genes can affect the way our immune system responds to an infection, which could explain why some people fare worse than others. \u201cThe possibilities, unfortunately, are endless,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova, an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and physician at Rockefeller University Hospital. \u201cBetween the first encounter with the virus and death, you can imagine that there are lots and lots of steps. At any of these steps, a defective immunity in any of the cells encountered by the virus can be responsible for severe disease and therefore death.\u201d\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nCasanova is leading a global study to try to identify what, if any, genetic mutations may cause otherwise healthy young people to have a more severe or deadly infection. The study will look for any shared genetic mutations among otherwise healthy patients under 50 who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to an ICU. From there, they can investigate those mutations further to determine whether they cause a susceptibility to severe COVID-19.\n\nAnother factor being investigated is the infectious dose, or the amount of virus a patient was exposed to when they first became ill. Could it affect how sick someone becomes, regardless of their age or health? This can be determined through epidemiological studies, where researchers compare groups of patients to learn more about how they first became infected and whether higher levels of viral exposure correspond to sicker patients. For example, Smith explained that researchers could track households where at least one member got COVID-19 and measure how much virus the patient is shedding, then observe how other members of the household fare. It can also be studied using animals in a lab to see how immune responses change at different levels of exposure.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that whether or not you have already been exposed to COVID-19 can determine how severe your infection is. With the dengue virus, for example, the first time someone is exposed to the virus, they often have only a mild infection, but if they encounter it a second time, it can become deadly. Researchers believe this is due to the antibodies the body creates after first exposure, which start to diminish over time. If they drop to a low enough level, they\u2019re not able to fight off the virus, but instead they inadvertently assist the virus in infecting cells. It\u2019s called antibody-dependent enhancement, and researchers are investigating whether past exposure to this or a similar coronavirus could worsen the symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nOther researchers are looking at whether the microbiome \u2014 the menagerie of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in and on the human body \u2014 could be playing a role. Microbiomes differ from person to person and some microbes have been known to help or hinder an individual\u2019s ability to fight off infection.\n\nAll of these possibilities will require studies that use control groups to determine whether these variables are actually causing a more severe reaction or if their presence is just a coincidence. It might be true that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients drink coffee, for example, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean drinking coffee puts you at a higher risk of COVID-19. (And, god, can you imagine if it did?)

In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen. But experts say relaxing social distancing measures too soon and before testing is widely available might result in another influx of cases, overwhelming the health care system and leading to even more deaths.\n\nFind the full data set on GitHub to see if your area is included and how it compares with other areas.", "author": ["Likhitha Butchireddygari"]}]}, "fivethirtyeight_economics": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/economics/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/economics/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-industries-hit-hardest-by-the-unemployment-crisis/", "published": "2020-05-15T18:35:25", "title": "The Industries Hit Hardest By The Unemployment Crisis", "text": "On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 2.98 million more Americans had filed for unemployment insurance in the previous week, bringing the total for claims since March 8 up to 36.8 million.

But it\u2019s clear that the leisure and hospitality industry was hurt far more than any other. In February, nearly 17 million Americans worked in that supersector, which comprises the arts, entertainment and recreation sector \u2014 including spectator sports and gambling \u2014 and the accommodations and food services sector. By April, that number had fallen by nearly 50 percent, to just 8.7 million.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality fields suffered heavy job losses Percent change in seasonally adjusted leisure and hospitality employees from February to April 2020, by supersector, sector and subsector Employees (millions) Industry Feb.

As such, leisure and hospitality businesses were always going to struggle under the pandemic\u2019s terrible constraints. Every subsector of this industry has lost at least 25 percent of its employees since February, and most have lost 40 percent or more. Among all the sectors and subsectors tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of April, only one \u2014 scenic and sightseeing transportation, which falls under the umbrella of trade, transportation and utilities \u2014 saw more job losses than amusements, gambling and recreation, which shed 60 percent of its employees in a two-month period.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t hit as hard as leisure and hospitality, the \u201cother services\u201d supersector also saw a 22 percent reduction in positions from February to April.

The struggles of hairstylists and cosmetologists during this crisis are well-documented, as these professions made up more than half the jobs in this supersector in 2019. And although laundry workers have been deemed essential in some states, many have seen business volume drop significantly \u2014 not only because customers have been avoiding unnecessary trips outside but also because homebound teleworkers aren\u2019t dressing as nicely as they otherwise would. As a result, the number of employees working in that slice of the economy has fallen by 54 percent since February.\n\nFor most other supersectors, jobs have dropped by somewhere between 8 and 13 percent since before the coronavirus crisis started, meaning almost every corner of the economy has been touched by the pandemic.

But even among the supersectors weathering things best, certain areas have seen plenty of job losses: The real estate market is teetering on the edge of a rent crisis, as unemployed tenants struggle to make payments, and rental/leasing jobs are down more than 20 percent from a few months ago. Both state and local government education are also down more than the overall government average over the past few months.\n\nBut those areas are still doing better than some others.

But no matter the size of the industry, only a few areas managed to resist a net decline in employees, compared with their pre-coronavirus norms.\n\nWith even more people filing unemployment claims every day that the coronavirus lockdowns continue, these numbers are likely to get even worse. By definition, recessions always exact a terrible toll on the job market. But this one is unusual in just how many people are out of work \u2014 and how wide-ranging the unemployment has already been.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-getting-more-money-from-unemployment-than-they-were-from-their-jobs/", "published": "2020-05-15T11:00:49", "title": "Many Americans Are Getting More Money From Unemployment Than They Were From Their Jobs", "text": "The United States is not known for its generosity to the unemployed. But the coronavirus crisis has transformed our system for compensating jobless workers. As tens of millions of workers suddenly became unemployed, Congress passed an expansive relief package with an unprecedented $600-per-week supplement for jobless workers. The goal was to replace their wages so they could survive the economic lockdown.\n\nAs a result, though, many people may now be eligible for substantially more money while unemployed than they made while they were working. A new analysis by Peter Ganong, Pascal Noel and Joseph Vavra, economists at the University of Chicago, uses government data from 2019 to estimate that 68 percent of unemployed workers who can receive benefits are eligible for payments that are greater than their lost earnings. They also found that the estimated median replacement rate \u2014 the share of a worker\u2019s original weekly salary that is being replaced by unemployment benefits \u2014 is 134 percent, or more than one-third above their original wage. A substantial minority of those workers, particularly in low-wage professions like food service and janitorial work, may end up receiving more than 150 percent of their previous weekly salary.\n\nThe research underscores one of the central \u2014 and most politically explosive \u2014 tensions of our economic crisis: What\u2019s the best way for our battered unemployment insurance system to keep jobless workers afloat during a historic downturn with no end in sight?\n\nThe idea behind a $600 payment was simple: In 2019, the national average unemployment payment was $370 per week and the national average salary for unemployment recipients was $970 per week. The additional $600 per week is meant to make up the difference, providing enough money on a weekly basis to fully replace the average unemployment recipient\u2019s salary. Other analyses of estimated average wages and unemployment benefits have already shown, though, that replacement rates likely vary quite a bit by state.\n\nBut looking at average wages doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, because the country\u2019s significant income inequality means that more workers fall into lower-wage categories. To address that problem, the new analysis simulates benefits for the median \u2014 rather than the mean \u2014 unemployment-eligible worker, drawing on Census Bureau labor supply data.\n\nThis data comes with a few important caveats. One is that because government data lags, the sample of workers the researchers drew on for the analysis does not reflect the much larger pool of people who are unemployed right now. If anything, Ganong told me, that means the researchers\u2019 estimates may understate how many unemployed workers will be eligible to receive more than their original salary during the current crisis, since the effects of the economic shutdown have disproportionately hit lower-income workers. Plus, the fact that workers are eligible for unemployment insurance doesn\u2019t mean they have the benefits yet. Delays in applying for and receiving unemployment payments have been widely reported across the country, and some workers are still struggling to get through their state\u2019s system.\n\nThe analysis illustrates how something that seems like a simple proposition \u2014 replacing jobless workers\u2019 salaries while a public health threat persists \u2014 is not something our unemployment insurance system was built to do quickly or easily. Most of the experts I spoke with agreed that back in March, when the unemployment insurance expansion passed, a flat payment was the most feasible solution. Unemployment benefits are always inconsistent across states, though, since each state sets its own rates. And now, those inequalities are even more pronounced. The median unemployment-eligible worker in Massachusetts is eligible for an estimated 125 percent of her former salary, compared to 166 percent in Mississippi.\n\nThe researchers uncovered other kinds of inequality, too. In some professions, like janitorial work, people who are employed by essential businesses are continuing to show up to their jobs under hazardous conditions. But in doing so, they may be eligible for less money than janitors who have been laid off or furloughed by a nonessential business. In an ideal world, Ganong said, the people who have kept working at hospitals or grocery stores would be receiving some kind of hazard pay. \u201cBut that\u2019s generally not the reality, which means there\u2019s a weakness in the current system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving more money to certain workers to stay home than to other workers who are putting themselves at risk by going to work.\u201d\n\nSeveral economists and unemployment insurance experts reviewed a draft of the analysis at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s request. Many were surprised by the number of workers estimated to be eligible for unemployment benefits that exceeded their original wages. \u201cI think we all knew that some workers were going to be getting more than their original earnings,\u201d said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI would not have guessed that it was quite this many workers, but I certainly think that it\u2019s a completely plausible figure.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether this will be a problem as the economy starts to reopen. In addition to the inequality inherent in possibly replacing some workers\u2019 wages at a higher rate, it might not make financial sense for workers to search for other jobs or even return to their original jobs if they\u2019re making substantially more money by staying home. Some experts don\u2019t see that as a bad thing \u2014 in fact, to some, providing an extra incentive to stay home during a pandemic might be a feature, not a bug. \u201cMy bigger worry is that workers will feel pressured to go back to an unsafe job,\u201d said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. But it could also make it more difficult for businesses to convince their workers to return \u2014 at least, at the salaries they were being paid before.\n\nA fight is already brewing on Capitol Hill about whether the $600-per-week payment should be continued after it expires at the end of July. House Democrats have argued that it\u2019s working well, and proposed a straightforward renewal of the existing payment as part of a bigger relief package. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for a cap on benefits or a bonus for workers who return to work. Another option, Ganong and his coauthors point out, is for the federal government to provide workers with a percentage of their lost wages that, combined with state unemployment insurance payments, would come close to replacing their original salary.\n\nBut that would require a more complex calculation by state unemployment insurance agencies \u2014 one they might be unwilling or unable to implement. \u201cIn a perfect world, I would prefer to give people a percentage of their income,\u201dsaid Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cBut we might not be set up to do it.\u201d Many state unemployment insurance agencies are still using decades-old computer systems, for example, presenting potential technical challenges if Congress asked them to change the benefits formula. And Daniel Zeitlin, the director of policy at Washington state\u2019s unemployment office, said that while he didn\u2019t think it was impossible, any change would be difficult for a system already under tremendous stress.\n\nAnother route is to simply reduce the fixed bonus payment when the $600-per-week benefit expires, or \u2014 as some Democratic politicians have proposed \u2014 phase out the benefit as social distancing requirements are eased and the unemployment rate starts to go down. Ramping down to a payment as small as $100 or $200 each week would still be generous by historical standards, according to Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, an economist at Harvard University. And it would continue to provide some kind of buffer for workers who have trouble finding jobs.\n\nSimply reducing the payment could end up exaggerating the lopsidedness rather than fixing it, though. According to the University of Chicago team\u2019s analysis, halving the payment to $300 per week would still mean that 42 percent of unemployed workers would be getting more than their original wages \u2014 and some people would be receiving a smaller fraction of their previous salary. A $300 weekly payment would leave one-quarter of unemployed workers with replacement rates below 60 percent. \u201cLots of people who earn more than the average or median wage are still living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Shierholz said. With a lower replacement rate, some of those people might start to struggle to pay for necessities like rent or groceries.\n\nSo if Congress opts to extend the expanded unemployment insurance program past the end of July, politicians will have to decide how much an unevenly distributed benefit really matters, particularly as public health concerns continue to loom. And the fate of the next phase of relief to jobless workers may hinge in part on what state unemployment insurance agencies can actually do. \u201cIt looks like health concerns are going to prevent a fast recovery, so it makes sense to keep a substantial boost to replacement rates,\u201d Chodorow-Reich said. \u201cIn an ideal world, the next round of funds will probably be more tailored to workers\u2019 individual circumstances. The question is whether our totally antiquated systems will be capable of pulling that off.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-part-time-consultant-and-uber-driver-navigated-through-filing-for-unemployment/", "published": "2020-05-11T14:00:08", "title": "This Part-Time Consultant And Uber Driver Navigated Through Filing For Unemployment", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net.

That was when she realized that her earlier cancellations may have stemmed from a handful of high-ranking federal workers understanding the extent of the virus sooner \u2014 and pulling their kids out of school accordingly.\n\nEach time Davidson looked at her dwindling pile of cash, she thought about getting back in her car. No, she wouldn\u2019t pick up and drop off people, which she considers too risky. But maybe sign up to deliver food for Uber? Then she considered where she lives \u2014 right near a hospital \u2014 and the fact that she\u2019d likely have to deliver to people who are working on patients who may be infected with the virus.\n\nIt\u2019s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t sort of feeling, she says. Many things have felt that way. Back in March, as the virus spread and it was clear that Davidson would have no money coming in, she took the step of filing for unemployment. She got an almost instant rejection. \u201cI knew that couldn\u2019t be the end of the answer,\u201d said Davidson, who has consistently made from $60,000 to $65,000 a year.\n\nShe then called the unemployment office and waited 6\u00bd hours on hold. As long as the wait was, the advice she ended up getting was helpful. She was told that her rejection was likely related to the unusual filing situations of Davidson and her boyfriend: Their Uber roles are considered non-wage jobs, and their consultant positions are seen as independent contractors. Complicated unemployment filings from people in those positions can\u2019t be greenlighted as easily, and first-time rejections are common. Davidson\u2019s adviser told her that the unemployment office would need more time to implement a better-fitting set of filing options for non-wage employees.\n\n\u201cThe system wasn\u2019t made for people like us,\u201d said Davidson, who files quarterly income statements for her work with Uber, which doesn\u2019t report worker income to the government.\n\nEven in light of the marathon call with the unemployment office, Davidson has kept a level head despite the stressful situation. She\u2019s not unfamiliar with being forced to make a situation more workable, having once negotiated a $700 medical bill down to closer to $100.\n\nHer persistence paid off: Aside from receiving their $1,200 stimulus checks, Davidson and her boyfriend finally qualified for unemployment, which has translated into checks for a little less than $800 a week each. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without unemployment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my salary, and of course I\u2019d need to make more at some point, but I feel completely blessed that it eventually came through.\u201d\n\nDavidson and her family have been able to avoid one key challenge facing many American families: They recently moved into a home her boyfriend inherited from his grandmother, eliminating any concerns about monthly housing payments.\n\nStill, as someone whose livelihood depends heavily on people having to be somewhere \u2014 be it a summer festival, or even just needing a ride-sharing option to make it to that festival \u2014 Davidson looks forward to being able to earn again. But she just doesn\u2019t want the reopening process to happen too soon, which could put people like her boyfriend at risk.\n\nDavidson takes that step seriously, so much so that she told her godson\u2019s mother that, because of the risks involved, they couldn\u2019t continue to shuttle the 9-year-old between their homes anymore \u2014 essentially saying either his mother would have to wait out the pandemic to visit with the child again, or that Davidson and her boyfriend would need to.\n\n\u201cI probably cried for three days after that,\u201d she said, adding that they recently decided to have the boy stay with his mother for the time being. \u201cBut that\u2019s how strongly I feel about it. My thought is, when hospitals say it\u2019s safe to go visit a loved one, then I\u2019ll think it\u2019s safe to go out and have things return to normal again.\u201d\n\nWhy does COVID-19 make some people sicker than others? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-terrible-jobs-report-gets-worse-the-more-you-read-it/", "published": "2020-05-08T15:18:06", "title": "The Terrible Jobs Report Gets Worse The More You Read It", "text": "Remember last month, when the jobs report was bad but not apocalyptic? Those were the days. The most recent jobs report is a stunning picture of how the pandemic has reshaped the country\u2019s labor market. Overall, 20.5 million fewer people were employed last month than in March. And the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 14.7 percent \u2014 by far the worst we\u2019ve seen in more than seven decades of economic data.\n\nBut the speed of the crisis also means that these numbers are already out of date. The jobs report is based on surveys of businesses and households taken during the middle of April, but the economic situation likely worsened as the month went on. And key metrics, like the unemployment rate, aren\u2019t capturing all the people who are actually out of work right now. According to this month\u2019s report, millions of workers were counted as employed even though they were absent from work for an unspecified reason \u2014 and if they had been counted as unemployed on a temporary layoff, the unemployment rate would have been 5 percentage points higher. In other words, as catastrophic as this report might seem, it almost certainly understates the pandemic\u2019s full economic devastation.\n\nTo be clear, that\u2019s not the fault of the researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who put the report together. Our economic data just wasn\u2019t designed for a moment where entire sectors of the economy shut down pretty much overnight, leaving millions of people without jobs. \u201cI think of our economic indicators as being a kind of a finely tuned speedometer that says, \u2018Are we a little over the speed limit or a little under?\u2019\u201d said Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report. \u201cAnd right now it\u2019s like we just pulled the emergency brake on the highway.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the report is useless or wrong. But making sense of the numbers \u2014 and what they mean for our ability to recover from this mess \u2014 is going to take a little more work than usual. Here\u2019s what to bear in mind as you read coverage of the jobs report (or dive into the nitty-gritty yourself) that can help you understand just how bad these numbers are, and what they mean for how the recession could play out.\n\nHeadline numbers may understate the damage\n\nThis month, there are good reasons to dig deeper into the report. There\u2019s always a significant amount of uncertainty in one of the topline numbers \u2014 the 20.5 million jobs that were lost \u2014 but the scale of the damage this month means that this month\u2019s estimate could be off by tens or even hundreds of thousands of jobs. Take the initial revision for payroll losses in March. Last month, the BLS reported that 701,000 jobs were lost. In this month\u2019s report, though, it\u2019s adjusted that to 870,000. And the April job losses are much, much larger, which means this month\u2019s report could be underestimating the magnitude of the damage by a significant amount.\n\nThe one thing we know for sure is that the unemployment rate is historically high. The government has been tracking this number for more than 70 years, and up till now, the peaks were 10.8 percent in 1982 and 10.0 percent in 2009. For context, economic historians estimate that during the Great Depression, the unemployment rate hit a peak of about 25 percent.\n\nThe real number may actually be closer to that Great Depression peak, because by this metric, only people without jobs who have been actively looking for one are considered unemployed. In normal times, that\u2019s already a bit of an issue because it means frustrated job seekers who have given up on finding something aren\u2019t counted. Now, the problem is even bigger because so many workers are being encouraged to stay home to combat the coronavirus. Others might not be job-hunting because they believe there\u2019s no work to be had.\n\n\u201cJob search is going to be tough when it\u2019s a public health risk to be in contact with people and whole sectors of the economy is effectively shut down,\u201d said Nick Bunker, a labor economist at the hiring site Indeed. \u201cSo lots of people who are out of work are probably not going to be included in the unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the possibility that some people may have been counted as employed even though it might be more accurate to say they\u2019re temporarily out of work. The misclassification may have happened because of the way workers are surveyed \u2014 if they say they were absent from work during the entire week that\u2019s referenced in the survey, interviewers follow up and ask why. Usually, the reasons fall into a standard set of buckets \u2014 vacation, childcare responsibilities, illness. But the number of workers who said they were absent from work for \u201cother reasons\u201d skyrocketed once the pandemic started, indicating that some people who had actually been furloughed may have misunderstood the question and answered in a way that indicated they were still employed.\n\nThis was a problem the BLS ran into in March, and again in April. In March, the researchers estimated that about 1.4 million people may have been misclassified as employed when they were actually temporarily out of work due to the pandemic; this month, it\u2019s a whopping 7.5 million people. According to the BLS, the April unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher if these people were included.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of just how many people are out of a job, there\u2019s another metric in the report that might be more useful \u2014 the share of the adult population who are employed. This number is particularly helpful in recessions, because that\u2019s when more people are likely to become discouraged and stop looking for work. This month, 51.3 percent of the adult population has a job, down from 60 percent in March. That\u2019s also a historic drop \u2014 and yet that number may also underestimate the damage because of the people who may have been mistakenly classified as employed.\n\nThe damage is widespread\n\nIt\u2019s important, too, to look not just at how many people are out of work, but which sectors of the economy have been hit hardest and which are continuing to do well. \u201cThere\u2019s a real question about how many industries can weather this moment,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative. In March, the job losses were overwhelmingly concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes bars and restaurants. This month, those industries were hit hardest again: leisure and hospitality lost 7.7 million jobs, a decline of 47 percent.\n\nBut the overall job losses were more spread out than they were last month, signaling that the effects of the shutdown are already rippling into other industries. For instance, there were sharp declines in the health care sector, mainly concentrated in dentists\u2019 and private doctors\u2019 offices, many of which were forced to close or lost a significant amount of business due to the pandemic. Retail, professional and business services \u2014 including temporary help services and services to businesses and dwellings \u2014 and manufacturing also lost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nThere were also some noteworthy disparities in who was more likely to be unemployed. The April unemployment rate was highest for Hispanic workers, at 18.9 percent, but black workers (16.7 percent) were also more likely to be unemployed than Asian (14.5 percent) or white (14.2 percent) workers. Racial disparities in the unemployment rate aren\u2019t that unusual \u2014 black workers, for example, generally have a higher unemployment rate than other groups. But the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers in particular was historically high, underscoring a running theme of this pandemic: workers of color are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the economic havoc.\n\nWomen (15.5 percent) also had a higher unemployment rate than men (13 percent) \u2014 which is atypical, since women usually have a lower unemployment rate than men. And in recessions, men are usually the first to feel the impact. But women are more likely to hold jobs in the industries that have been pummeled since the pandemic began, like health care and child care services, which may explain why they\u2019re experiencing more of the job losses this time around.\n\nGimbel told us she\u2019ll also be looking at the diffusion index, which is a measure that shows how many industries are gaining or losing jobs. That number, she said, can tell us at a glance \u201chow widespread the carnage is.\u201d This month, the diffusion index is 4.8, which is shockingly low, and signals that job losses were extremely widespread across industries. In February, for example, the diffusion index was 53.7.\n\nAnother important tidbit that\u2019s not captured in the employment figures but reflects how widespread the damage has been: the number of people who were working part-time because they couldn\u2019t find full-time work or their hours were reduced doubled in April, landing at 10.9 million.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in trying to figure out how painful the recovery might be, you can learn a lot by looking at the share of people who were temporarily laid off in April, rather than permanently fired. This may be the least catastrophic part of the report. As in March, the vast majority of jobs lost in April were temporary: 18.1 million of the newly unemployed said they had lost their jobs temporarily, while 2.0 million said the loss was permanent. To be clear \u2014 in a more normal moment, 2.0 million lost jobs would be an eye-popping number. But the fact that the job losses are mostly temporary is important because it will be much easier for people who have been furloughed to return to work when businesses start to reopen \u2014 assuming, of course, that those businesses haven\u2019t shuttered in the meantime.\n\nRead the fine print\n\nThe jobs report is based on two surveys: one of businesses, and one of ordinary households. Normally, that\u2019s barely worth remarking on. But this is not an ideal time to be doing surveys of businesses or people. Last month, the call centers where the surveys are conducted were shut down, and in-person follow-up interviews aren\u2019t happening either. That increases the uncertainty around the numbers in ways that BLS researchers explained in a 14-page note that accompanied the jobs report.\n\nTake the response rate. Julie Hatch Maxfield, an associate commissioner at the BLS, told us some variation in the share of participants who respond is normal, particularly because the survey of businesses is sometimes conducted on a more truncated timeline. In April, the response rate for the survey of businesses was actually much higher than it was in March. But the response rate for the survey of households was 70 percent, compared to 73 percent in March. That lower response rate introduces more uncertainty \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to know how that uncertainty influenced the data. For example, Gimbel pointed out it\u2019s possible that unemployed people may actually be overrepresented in the household survey, because they have more time to talk with a government interviewer.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to predict what next month\u2019s jobs report will show, it is likely to offer more detail about how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting Americans economically. A series of questions are being added to next month\u2019s survey of households that will capture how the pandemic has changed our work lives \u2014 for instance, whether people are teleworking, or if the crisis has kept them from searching for work. That might not solve all of the problems with the unemployment rate, but it will make the economic picture a little clearer \u2014 although probably not more uplifting.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 broke the jobless claims chart", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-essential-worker-is-busier-than-ever-without-leaving-her-house/", "published": "2020-05-04T14:00:46", "title": "This Essential Worker Is Busier Than Ever Without Leaving Her House", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nThe nation\u2019s unemployment statistics are staggering, and the stories of the workers who constitute those numbers are humbling, including those who suddenly had job offers rescinded and those who have seen their hours cut as a result of the coronavirus\u2019s spread.\n\nBut another reality of this downturn is that some have seen an increase in work the past two months. Many of them hold the kind of essential jobs that wouldn\u2019t immediately come to mind.\n\nRomie Faienza, a 39-year-old Massachusetts resident, is one such person. Faienza works as a closed captioner and specializes in live voice writing \u2014 she listens to what is said during an event and carefully repeats that wording into a microphone connected to her computer, where her speech is transcribed into written words.\n\nShe has had her hands full since the pandemic emerged in the United States. Along with the daily briefings that President Trump had been doing, governors from states across the country started holding news conferences on the fallout from COVID-19. The process of transcribing what is said at them, given their importance and that more people who are hard of hearing would be at home watching the news, is both a busy and critical task for the time being.\n\nBefore all this, Faienza was working 40-hour weeks but was plotting out how she would use the time off she had accumulated. \u201cI actually spoke with my supervisor and said I intended to work a lot less\u201d this year, Faienza said, adding that she uses spare time to edit magazine pieces and write screenplays.\n\nBut then the pandemic happened, totally altering that plan. Now, she\u2019s working 50-hour weeks to keep up.\n\nThe demand for her work appears to go beyond just the additional hours. Faienza said another captioning company reached out to her recently, in the hopes of convincing her to consider a job with them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m flattered, but I can\u2019t entertain the idea of making a big change right now,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe notion of stability has always been meaningful for Faienza. Her voice has to remain consistently level \u2014 both in terms of volume and intonation \u2014 to ensure her captioning will come across clearly and accurately. And from a financial standpoint, she and her husband had made a point to save pretty aggressively in case something unforeseen came up.\n\nThings seem solid for now for Faienza, who made just less than $50,000 last year and is the family\u2019s breadwinner. With overtime, she\u2019s earning about $200 more per paycheck, and her stimulus money is still on the way as well. Lately, she\u2019s used some of her overtime pay to purchase gift cards at suburban Boston-area restaurants. \u201cI want these places to still be there when all of this is over,\u201d she said.\n\nFaienza\u2019s real challenge has been in areas that others throughout the country can likely relate to: the emotional toll the news can take on those who, like Faienza, have no choice but to immerse themselves in it.\n\nWhile her work itself hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed \u2014 \u201cMy life was already pretty socially distanced, because I work from home in a studio with the door closed,\u201d she said \u2014 it\u2019s challenging for her to put in a few extra hours each day because she has two young sons, 6 and 8 years old. The older child has said he misses being in school \u2014 and not just because he doesn\u2019t get to see his friends and teacher. He told Faienza that he genuinely misses the sense of achievement that accompanies doing a good job on a test or an assignment.\n\nFortunately, the kids are positioned well from a schooling standpoint: Ciro, Faienza\u2019s husband, is serving as their teacher for now. And the transition is likely smoother for him than for other parents, since he already has teaching experience, having previously taught English to people looking to acquire it as a foreign language.\n\nFaienza\u2019s parents, who are about 70 years old, live with the rest of the family, so the concept of leaving the house for an outing of some sort hasn\u2019t been entertained. But the kids seem to have adapted to that part of the deal OK so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty nerdy anyway. Because we\u2019re in Massachusetts, we\u2019ve had snowstorms before, where we\u2019ve been stuck inside for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of playing board games, watching movies, playing video games, listening to each other. There\u2019s always been a lot of that. And we do have a backyard, which isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s enough to go outside to do chalk drawings or toss the ball around.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the strangest element of all this for Faienza was the timing; it felt as if she were seeing the country through a time machine of sorts. She knew pretty early, for instance, that the coronavirus situation in China had gotten serious because an increasing amount of the news conferences she had to caption here in the states were on that subject. That led her, around the first week of March, to urge her parents to avoid taking communion at church and avoid shaking anyone\u2019s hands there. At that same time, she also told a family friend to place an order for CPAP equipment, since the parts figured to become more difficult to get as the virus continued to spread \u2014 and might possibly shut entire industries down.\n\nThat feeling of time travel grew more surreal as Faienza captioned news conferences in New York, where the virus was ravaging the state. Seeing all the steps that officials were taking there as several other states delayed or opted against implementing stay-at-home orders prompted her to worry the nation didn\u2019t grasp the seriousness of the virus, and that its transmission might not slow down in a timely fashion.\n\nFaienza\u2019s hope now is that, soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to go back in time. Then she will be able to make use of those gift cards she bought to patronize the local restaurants as we get back a semblance of what everyday American life was like before the coronavirus erased that notion for millions of people.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen. Is it ready?", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-crises-and-domestic-violence-and-what-that-could-mean-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-04T11:00:10", "title": "What We Know About Crises And Domestic Violence \u2014 And What That Could Mean For COVID-19", "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, in addition to its direct impact on people\u2019s health, has unleashed a perfect storm of conditions that may increase the rate of domestic violence. Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

According to Thursday\u2019s data release from the Department of Labor, 3.8 million more Americans filed for unemployment insurance during the week ending April 25. Although that represents the fourth consecutive week of decline in seasonally adjusted initial claims, the number remains historic. (Remember, no single week prior to March 21 had ever seen even 1 million initial claims since 1967, the earliest year that data is available from the Federal Reserve.) If we add up all of the initial claims filed since the coronavirus recession began, more than 30 million people \u2014 or nearly 19 percent of the total U.S. labor force \u2014 have filed for unemployment claims over the past month and a half.\n\nExperts have all had their eyes trained on initial unemployment claims, both because they tell us about the ongoing scale of the crisis and because they\u2019re one of the rare weekly indicators of the economy at large. Some economists think this weekly trend of massive unemployment numbers includes industries that weren\u2019t hit hard at first but are now beginning to feel the ripple effects of the recession as it spreads through the economy. \u201cJob separations will likely remain high for a while, as softer demand spills over into industries not initially directly affected by shutdowns,\u201d Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst told Reuters. (This is corroborated by sources such as the hiring site Indeed, which has consistently seen 30 to 40 percent fewer jobs posted than the norm since late March.)\n\nOf course, this week\u2019s data still includes many unemployment claims that overwhelmed state agencies were not able to process immediately after they were filed. And there are still many workers struggling week by week in industries directly affected by coronavirus shutdowns, such as in restaurants or other parts of the service sector. Several weeks ago, we pointed to research by St. Louis Fed economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro, who estimated that nearly 50 million jobs were at risk as the country tried to mitigate the virus\u2019s spread. If our current slight downward pattern of initial claims continues each week, we would reach that mark by July.\n\nBut will the numbers continue in that same pattern? One of the hallmarks of this crisis is the high number of furloughs \u2014 people who are out of work now (and therefore able to file initial claims) but who could potentially return to their jobs when the economy restarts. A recent analysis from the California Policy Lab found that 90 percent of that state\u2019s workers who filed for unemployment in early April expected to go back to their previous jobs, a much higher share than the 40 percent who gave that response in February. With many states moving toward reopening at least some businesses by next week, a large number of those who filed claims earlier in the crisis could potentially be returning to work.\n\nThat\u2019s why another important indicator will be what\u2019s called continued claims, or insured unemployment \u2014 the number of people actually receiving unemployment benefits in any given week. (According to the Department of Labor, that number was 17,992,000 for the week ending April 18.) It lags a week behind initial claims, since not all initial claimants are actually eligible to receive payments, but it gives us a faster-moving measure of where the crisis might be headed than the traditional unemployment rate, which is released each month. The decline of continued claims tends to go in lockstep with the end of recessions, and it will be important to watch how that metric changes as the restarting economy begins to go through another phase of incredible upheaval over the next month.\n\n\u2018We have a ways to go until data\u2019 allows states to reopen: Nate Silver", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-americans-who-suffered-when-the-economy-shut-down-are-also-in-more-danger-as-it-reopens/", "published": "2020-04-28T17:33:33", "title": "The Americans Who Suffered When The Economy Shut Down Are Also In More Danger As It Reopens", "text": "It\u2019s been more than six weeks since Daniel last rode his bike to his office, where he works on the business operations team at a beverage company in the Pacific Northwest. At first he was apprehensive about working from home for the indefinite future, but within a few weeks he realized he was feeling more focused and productive than ever before. Even when restrictions are lifted on companies like his, he doesn\u2019t expect to be spending a lot of time at the office. \u201cI\u2019ll go back for certain meetings if things start to reopen, but for the most part I think we\u2019re going to be remote for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel knows not everyone has that luxury. \u201cI just keep saying to myself \u2014 I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, because I\u2019ve basically been able to continue working unaffected,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the COVID-19 crisis continues, the ability to work from home could turn into one of the most important markers of privilege for American workers.\n\nAccording to a survey of 25,000 respondents fielded online April 1\u20135, more than 34 percent of people who were employed four weeks earlier reported that they used to commute to work, but were now working from home. Add that to the nearly 15 percent of respondents who said they were already working from home, and nearly half the country is teleworking.\n\nBut the ability to work remotely isn\u2019t randomly distributed \u2014 it\u2019s concentrated among people who are already more likely to have higher incomes and more stable employment.\n\nIn a recent working paper, economists Simon Mongey, Laura Pilossoph and Alex Weinberg created two metrics to understand which workers will be hit especially hard by the coronavirus crisis, using data from the Labor Department. The first measures the extent to which a given occupation can be performed from home, and the other measures the amount of close proximity to other people that the job requires. Sure enough, the jobs that are likely harder to do from home or are more likely to involve close physical proximity tend to be filled by people who are more economically vulnerable. For instance, jobs that are more difficult to work from home are disproportionately held by lower-income workers.\n\nThis research generally aligns with other recent studies that have found that the COVID-19 crisis has had a bigger economic impact on people with lower incomes and levels of education. That dynamic is now going to force many poorer Americans to choose between their safety and a paycheck as the economy starts to reopen.\n\nOne of those workers who could soon be facing that unpleasant calculus is Erica Harrison, who lost her job setting up displays at a department store in Louisiana last month. She was already struggling to live on $12 per hour, and spent the last few weeks scrambling to get her unemployment insurance payments set up so she could buy groceries and make her car payments. Now she finally has enough money to support herself \u2014 but a few days after her benefits started to arrive, her supervisor called to ask how she\u2019d feel about coming back to her job if the store was able to reopen.\n\nThe idea of returning to work knocked her back on her heels. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying thought because the risk of getting sick is so high,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job to touch everything in the store \u2014 the fixtures, the mannequins, the plexiglass.\u201d She lives with her mother, who recently recovered from heart surgery, so Harrison is especially concerned about spreading the virus to family members. But she had to take her supervisor\u2019s question seriously. She lost her health insurance along with her job, and she\u2019s wary of turning down work in the midst of a recession. And she would probably no longer qualify for unemployment benefits if she was offered her job back and chose not to return. \u201cIn my mind it pretty much comes down to: do you care more about your money or your health?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was a way for me to stay indoors and keep getting my paycheck. But that option is not available to me.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Harrison isn\u2019t simply that it\u2019s impossible to do her job from home. Her job also involves close contact with other people, putting her at higher risk for contracting or spreading the virus if she did come back to work. She isn\u2019t alone. The economists\u2019 research shows that jobs that require close physical proximity are disproportionately occupied by poorer Americans.\n\nAnd the workers who are disproportionately represented in both kinds of jobs are also more economically vulnerable. Many of the jobs where working from home is more difficult are held by workers without a college degree, and those workers are also overrepresented in jobs that require more face-to-face interaction. The same is true of lower-income workers, who make up more than half of workers in jobs where working from home is unlikely to be feasible and of jobs that involve closer proximity to other people.\n\nThis means that workers who were hit hardest by the economic shutdown are also disproportionately likely to suffer as the recovery unfolds. In places where the economy is being reopened more quickly, they\u2019ll have to confront the prospect of returning to dangerous work before the virus is fully contained. In places where economic activity is remaining frozen for longer \u2014 or only only partially resuming \u2014 they may face longer-term unemployment if their employers can\u2019t reopen quickly or fully. Unemployment benefits can be a salve, especially since the federal government temporarily boosted the amounts by $600 per week. But many Americans\u2019 benefits have not been processed. And that extra money is currently scheduled to stop at the end of July. But the economy probably won\u2019t be back to normal by then. \u201cIf the recovery begins by bringing back workers who are in jobs where they don\u2019t have a lot of contact with other people, that will mean people in high physical proximity jobs will be hurting economically for longer,\u201d Mongey said.\n\nOf course, not everyone who has transitioned to teleworking is leading a charmed life. Daniel was almost apologetic about his good fortune \u2014 he\u2019s young, with no kids and a well-paying job, leaving him plenty of time for Zoom catch-ups with friends and road biking. In some ways, his financial situation has actually improved. He and his partner are rarely ordering out for food, and he got a flood of refunds as races he\u2019d signed up to run over the next few months were canceled.\n\nBut other workers, like Kyrie Martin, a high school math teacher in California, told us they can\u2019t wait to get back to their old, analog workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s maddening enough to try to teach AP Statistics remotely without my first-grade daughter coming in and playing hangman with the students on the whiteboard behind me,\u201d Martin said. But she was quick to add how lucky she felt to still be working.\n\nAnd Martin\u2019s job as a public school teacher probably isn\u2019t in danger of disappearing. As Harrison weighed her options, she was alarmed to see reports that big department stores like Neiman Marcus have been among the first economic casualties of the economic crisis. She wonders if her employer might be next, even if it manages to reopen. \u201cIf I\u2019m questioning if it\u2019s safe to come to work for a paycheck, who\u2019s going to want to come in of their own free will to shop?\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not an irrational fear. After past recessions, some of the lost jobs didn\u2019t come back when the recovery began \u2014 particularly lower-paying positions that don\u2019t require specialized skills.\n\nIn the meantime, Harrison\u2019s days are full of anxiety and boredom. \u201cWhen this quarantine started, I tried to get up early, keep up a routine, stay productive, but that\u2019s kind of fallen apart,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty much my only regular activity these days is going to the store to see if they\u2019ve restocked on Lysol.\u201d When her unemployment benefits started to hit her bank account, she could at least stop worrying about covering next month\u2019s car payment. But she\u2019s not optimistic about what will happen when the economy begins to open up again. \u201cWhen things start going back to normal, I think I\u2019m going to end up sick or unemployed.\u201d\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-moved-to-the-city-and-started-a-thriving-business-then-he-needed-a-loan-to-make-rent/", "published": "2020-04-27T14:00:37", "title": "He Moved To The City And Started A Thriving Business.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nAs 40-year-old Adam Bee approached his one-year anniversary as a New York City resident, he felt more and more confident that his decision to move there was a good one.\n\nBee had recently moved to the big city to start work as a sort of consultant, and business was taking off. He had just led a successful work retreat, and his client bookings were reaching new heights both in number and frequency. The uptick allowed the Tennessee native to rent a bigger two-bedroom apartment \u2014 which meant he could see clients from a home office \u2014 and gave him the money to finally purchase a monthly health care plan in March.\n\nBut as the novel coronavirus started to spread early that month, businesses shut down rapidly, perhaps none more rapidly than Bee\u2019s. As a sex coach \u2014 he works with individuals and couples to be more in sync sexually and spiritually \u2014 Bee saw his income dry up all at once, even before stay-at-home orders were issued for New York state.\n\nShould we sacrifice our data privacy to fight the coronavirus?\n\n\u201cIt was my decision to shut things down and cancel the remaining classes I had scheduled,\u201d said Bee, whose coaching sessions were held in person. \u201cIt just felt like the ethical thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut the hit was significant. At the peak of his success, he was bringing in between $8,000 and $12,000 a month, charging clients $3,500 for a set of five sessions. (In a global city like New York, the demand for his \u201csacred-intimacy\u201d services \u2014 and clients\u2019 ability to pay for them \u2014 was a key part of Bee\u2019s calculation to move there.) In his mind, there wasn\u2019t an immediate way to still do his work safely and in person while justifying that kind of cost, especially with other people finding themselves out of work by the millions because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI was in a complete place of fear,\u201d Bee said. \u201cFor the first two weeks of this, I just kind of stared at the wall.\u201d He gave some thought to looking for work in his previous fields \u2014 politics and marketing \u2014 before realizing that those options, too, had likely thinned considerably as a result of the cratering economy. Between the wails of ambulance sirens, he\u2019d break down in tears at times, thinking about just how dire his situation was: \u201cI was going to be homeless in a matter of days.\u201d\n\nIneligible for unemployment, Bee has done what he could do to eliminate spending. The bronze health care plan he\u2019d gotten days earlier for $476 a month with a $5,000 deductible? He scrapped it entirely and followed that up by applying for Medicaid (his application has been approved). The virus has made Bee more or less terrified of walking into a grocery store, so he limits himself to one trip every three weeks now. That has also helped him save money, though his diet these days has gotten pretty mundane, consisting mostly of grains and beans.\n\nThe biggest financial help for Bee was a $10,000 loan from a friend to cover his Upper East Side rent until his lease expires. \u201cThat was pretty fucking special,\u201d he said of his friend\u2019s generosity. Bee plans to hunt for a cheaper living situation once the lease runs out this summer.\n\nThe other bright spot has been the slight rebound in Bee\u2019s business. After those initial despondent weeks, he eventually concluded that it might be possible to do his coaching virtually, as opposed to in-person only. With that in mind, Bee spruced up his website, and by the third week of March, he began holding virtual sessions. That first week alone, he coached more than 100 people. \u201cMy web traffic is more than double what it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that things are back to how they were before. Bee is charging a mere fraction of his old rate \u2014 $750 for five sessions \u2014 so it takes him five times as many virtual bookings to make what he earned for in-person meetings. \u201cI\u2019m having to work more now than I ever have in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nBee is cautiously optimistic that his in-person clients will return once society is closer to normal again, adding to his burgeoning online business. \u201cI\u2019ve got clients in five states and a couple different countries now,\u201d he said.

After spiking to 6.9 million for the week ending on March 28, the number of new seasonally adjusted claims has gone down each successive week, though the numbers are still astronomical. About 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the past five weeks, the same number you would get if you added up the initial-claims numbers from March 14 going back to Nov. 25 \u2026 of 2017.\n\nJust to put all of this further in perspective: If the total U.S. labor force is 163 million strong, at least 16 percent of it has now lost a job since mid-March. (And that\u2019s without even accounting for the previous unemployment rate of around 3.5 percent that existed before the coronavirus really hit the U.S.) COVID-19 is creating an unemployment crisis unlike anything America has seen in a very, very long time.\n\nPerhaps that explains some of why we\u2019re beginning to see backlash against the full stay-at-home orders that have been enacted in 42 states and the District of Columbia as a means of slowing the coronavirus\u2019s spread. A number of states have seen protesters descend on their capitols to decry the lockdowns, and the governors of several states, including Georgia and South Carolina, have announced plans to reopen their economies.\n\nPublic outcry is not exactly unexpected when frustrations mount over lost wages in the middle of a national disaster. But are the protests really about unemployment and economic hardship? In some states, it would make sense \u2014 if you add up the advance unemployment claims filed in Michigan since March 15, they account for 24 percent of the state\u2019s labor force. That\u2019s a massive amount of unemployment, the likes of which would seem to be driving the anger we saw in Lansing last week. However, the relationship isn\u2019t nearly as clear-cut when you look at every state.\n\nOverall, according to news reports, there were 28 states over the past week with gatherings of at least 100 people protesting stay-at-home orders and six with at least 1,000 people, out of a possible 42 states (plus Washington, D.C.) with shelter-in-place orders. When looking at what would predict whether a locked-down state would have a protest of at least 100 people, we broke down each state based on the share of the labor force that has filed advance claims since March 15; the state\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus cases; the number of days since the state enacted the lockdown; and the party affiliation of the governor. Here are the averages in each of those categories, depending on whether the state saw a protest:\n\nProtest states have had less COVID-19 \u2014 and unemployment Economic, public-health and political averages among states (and the District of Columbia) with lockdown orders, by whether the state had an anti-lockdown protest of at least 100 people States with\u2026 Protests No Protest Count 28 15 Advance claims as share of labor force 15.0% 16.3% COVID-19 cases per million 1,933.3 2,685.0 Days since lockdown 26.5 26.9 Share w/ Democratic governors* 57.1% 60.0% *Including the mayor of Washington, D.C. Sources: Department of Labor, The New York Times\n\nNone of the differences above are statistically significant, but they do show a few interesting trends about which states have protests \u2014 and why. On average, states with protests have 28 percent fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than states without protests, which might play into a mindset that places the economic fallout of the crisis ahead of the virus\u2019s health implications. But states with protests have also seen smaller shares of their workforce file advance unemployment claims than their counterparts, which suggests that the protests are not purely economic in nature. (Although 15 percent of the labor force filing for unemployment in a five-week span is certainly not nothing.) Protest states have also been under lockdown for slightly fewer days, on average, than states without protests.\n\nPerhaps most surprising in this breakdown is that a larger share of protest states had Republican governors than the states without protests, given the perception (from states like Michigan and California) that protesters \u2014 often organized by conservative interest groups \u2014 were trying to undermine Democratic governors\u2019 stay-at-home orders. (Then again, maybe this simply speaks to a more right-leaning tendency for the populations of states that saw protests.)\n\nAs the job-loss numbers continue to pile up over the coming weeks, we may see even more people pile out of their houses to argue against the coronavirus stay-at-home orders. But the numbers above show that there\u2019s more than just economics at work behind the protests.\n\nSara Ziegler contributed research.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-is-hard-for-everyone-its-even-harder-for-parents-who-dont-make-much-money/", "published": "2020-04-23T19:59:29", "title": "This Is Hard For Everyone. It\u2019s Even Harder For Parents Who Don\u2019t Make Much Money.", "text": "The COVID-19 crisis has turned parents\u2019 lives upside down. Kids are home from school and daycare, and parents of all economic means are struggling to care for them. But while parents who are still working might be teetering between madness and exhaustion, workers who have suddenly lost jobs and income are facing a different kind of balancing act. That\u2019s particularly the case for low-wage workers. Even when the economy was good, many were already struggling with stress and financial insecurity. Now they\u2019re in an even more precarious position.\n\nA recent survey of low-wage parents gives us an unusually detailed window into the stressful new reality that some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable families are facing. Elizabeth Ananat, an economics professor at Barnard College and Anna Gassman-Pines, a public policy professor at Duke University, started the study last summer. The plan was to periodically survey the same pool of almost 700 parents who work for hourly wages in the service industry in a large U.S. city, recording the everyday pressures and anxieties that shaped low-income families\u2019 lives. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and their project took on new meaning.\n\nBy chance, one of their surveys was conducted between late February and late March, and captured the impact of last month\u2019s economic trainwreck in real time. The first inkling that something profound had changed in the survey participants\u2019 lives came in mid-March. That was right around the time that the city where they lived issued a sweeping lockdown order, closing schools and nonessential businesses. (The researchers are keeping the city anonymous to protect participants\u2019 privacy.) Two things happened almost immediately: According to a series of short daily surveys, respondents\u2019 mental health took a sudden nosedive, and so did the hours they reported having worked that day. \u201cThis is a group that\u2019s already experiencing a lot of stress, so any increase is noteworthy,\u201d Gassman-Pines said. \u201cAnd their stress and anxiety went way, way up after the nonessential businesses closed and their work hours fell.\u201d\n\nIt also exposed how quickly their financial situation could turn from precarious to untenable. In addition to their monthlong survey, Ananat and Gassman-Pines sent out a separate, one-time survey in late March to gauge in more detail how respondents were doing. Less than half of the parents surveyed said that they would get any pay for lost work, including sick leave. And more than one-third reported that their income had fallen by more than half since the crisis began. Almost half of the parents in their sample had already lost their jobs.\n\nThe research gives a rare glimpse into what happened to this group of people during the devastating two-week window in March when millions of low-wage workers abruptly lost their jobs. Most of the surveys you\u2019re used to reading about on FiveThirtyEight are designed to give a broad, comprehensive snapshot of how Americans of all stripes feel about a particular issue. But in pursuit of a result that is actually representative of the country, pollsters and researchers often sacrifice the ability to zero in on the experiences of small, highly specific slices of the population, such as the low-wage parents in Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey. Their findings are, in turn, limited in important ways \u2014 their respondents live in the same city, work in the same types of jobs (like retail, hospitality or house cleaning), and are all parents of young children. But when I talked to parents across the country who lost jobs and income as a result of the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 many of whom were already struggling financially \u2014 their stress and anxiety was palpable, and most were struggling to find any kind of support.\n\nMuch of the impact is falling on mothers like Chelsey Johnson, 27, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with her 10-year-old daughter. (Johnson was not part of the survey.) Right after she lost her job as a server and bartender at a local Creole restaurant, she tried to apply for unemployment insurance and was told she wasn\u2019t eligible because a previous employer hadn\u2019t paid into the program. She found another job, bagging and delivering lunches to local kids, but it pays less and puts her in contact with other people all day.\n\nFor women like Johnson, the COVID-19 crisis is magnifying the inequalities they already grapple with on a daily basis. According to research by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, 74 percent of parents in the country\u2019s 40 lowest-paying jobs are mothers. A survey by Lean In conducted in April found that women \u2014 particularly black women \u2014 were more worried than men about paying for basic necessities. It\u2019s no wonder that the pandemic took a greater immediate emotional toll on mothers of children under the age of 18, who were substantially more likely than fathers to say the coronavirus crisis has had a negative impact on their mental health, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in March.\n\n\u201cI just have to keep praying I don\u2019t get the virus because how else am I going to make money for my baby and me?\u201d Johnson said. Everything, she said, felt like it was falling apart \u2014 even her ability to access government resources, like food stamps, that she had gotten before. At work, while she put together lunches, she was on hold with the food stamp office for hours, trying to figure out why she hadn\u2019t received a key piece of paperwork to finish her application. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty positive person and I already knew how to shuffle my money around to make it all work \u2014 pay a little bit on my rent, my car note, try to catch up when I can,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my income is taking a hit and I\u2019m worried about getting sick. This is a whole new level of stress.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Johnson\u2019s predicament should be unusual \u2014 many states loosened restrictions on unemployment insurance to make it easier for the newly jobless to apply, and governments rushed to make other emergency services, like food pickups for kids, available to people who had suddenly lost their income. But Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey found that most people who needed these benefits weren\u2019t receiving them quickly. By the end of last month, less than half of the survey respondents who had been laid off had applied for unemployment insurance, and a tiny fraction of applicants (8 percent) had received it. And most of the parents also weren\u2019t getting the government resources that were supposed to help them feed and educate the kids who were suddenly home from school. Only about half of the parents surveyed said that their children were receiving school lessons online, and very small shares said they had accessed emergency benefits like emergency child care or grab-and-go meals.\n\nIn the weeks that have passed since the survey closed, more parents in the survey have undoubtedly started to receive other benefits. But their precarious financial position meant that every day of delay made paying bills or buying food even more difficult. In late March, some parents in the survey were already struggling to pay for essentials: About one-fifth of respondents said they would be unable to pay rent in the next month if the crisis continued. And the creaky machinery of government bureaucracy has delayed unemployment insurance payments, snarled food stamp applications and held up relief checks.\n\nEven the prospect of applying for unemployment insurance was difficult for Israel Torres, 35, a father of two who works as a culinary specialist at a university in Los Angeles. When we spoke, the university was planning to furlough its workers in a few days. (They ended up extending the deadline by a month after pressure from the workers and the union.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay calm and not make this situation stressful for the kids, but it\u2019s really hard when I\u2019m thinking all the time about what happens if I stop getting paid, how I\u2019ll cover my bills,\u201d he said. Torres and his family live paycheck to paycheck, he said, and they were already struggling because he lost his second job at a theater that closed down early in the crisis. His children were chafing at the order to stay indoors, asking their dad if they were in prison. It was difficult enough, he said, to try to keep the children entertained and engaged with their schoolwork, and avoid falling into a depression. \u201cI know I can apply for unemployment insurance if I get furloughed but I don\u2019t know how much money I\u2019d get or when it would come in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it would be too late for us.\u201d\n\nThen there are the parents who won\u2019t get any government aid at all \u2014 in particular, people who are living in the country illegally and aren\u2019t eligible for benefits. Ananat and Gassman-Pines didn\u2019t ask about immigration status in their survey, but since some estimates indicate that people living in the country illegally make up a significant chunk of the service industry, they\u2019re among the workers who have been especially hard hit.\n\nAmelia Rojas, who lives with her husband and four children in Connecticut, stopped going to her job as a housekeeper because she was worried about catching the virus and passing it to her children. Her husband doesn\u2019t have the same luxury, though \u2014 after losing his job at a restaurant, their sudden loss of income meant he had to pick up a few hours working at a landscaping firm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my husband will become infected, but we have no other choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t qualify for government help.\u201d\n\nThose twin anxieties \u2014 what would happen if her husband went to work, and what would happen if he didn\u2019t \u2014 were in Rojas\u2019s mind all the time. She described the precautions that she and her husband thought were necessary \u2014 he scrubbed himself down when he returned home from work and avoided contact with the children. \u201cBut the kids look for their dad and every time they see him, they want to be with him,\u201d she said. And even with her husband\u2019s limited income from landscaping, she was still figuring out how to pay their rent and cell phone bills. \u201cI am living with so many concerns, you have no idea.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-a-shortage-of-sand-and-other-common-items-could-delay-a-coronavirus-vaccine/", "published": "2020-04-21T23:44:17", "title": "How A Shortage Of Sand (And Other Common Items) Could Delay A Coronavirus Vaccine", "text": "How A Shortage Of Sand (And Other Common Items) Could Delay A Coronavirus Vaccine\n\nAs laboratories across the globe scramble to make a COVID-19 vaccine, manufacturers face shortages of common ingredients and supplies.

Last Tuesday, an International Monetary Fund report said that the world is hurtling toward the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Economists at big investment banks have warned more or less the same: Goldman Sachs recently predicted that U.S. GDP would shrink by 34 percent in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of the year, and Morgan Stanley forecasts that this year, we could see the steepest drop in annual GDP growth since 1946.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Economists aren\u2019t especially good at predicting recessions. In this instance, with at least 20 million people out of work in the U.S. and pretty much every country suffering from the pandemic, it seems almost certain that we\u2019re in one. But forecasting the path of a recession isn\u2019t an easy task under the best of circumstances. And we are not living through the best of circumstances right now. \u201cThis is not a situation where you can push a button on the computer and out comes a number,\u201d said Jonathan Wright, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s detective work. And it will mostly be wildly wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd we also don\u2019t know how it will be wrong. The forecasters are pretty much in agreement that the next months are going to be full of economic pain \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot less consensus about how quickly the economy will bounce back. Goldman Sachs, for example, is predicting an \u201cunprecedented\u201d recovery in the second half of the year, once businesses start to reopen. The chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, meanwhile, says she\u2019s expecting a much more gradual return to positive economic growth. If anything, a recent study suggests that forecasters tend to be too optimistic about when recession recoveries will begin, which means the return to a normal economy could be slower and bumpier than many economists are currently predicting.\n\nLook at recession predictions for the past year, and you\u2019ll start to understand why some economists raise an eyebrow at some of their colleagues\u2019 efforts to play Cassandra. After a flurry of ominous warnings about an impending recession last summer, most forecasters were predicting a strong year for the U.S. economy. Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told me a story about a presentation he gave at a conference on the global economic outlook back in February. At that moment, the novel coronavirus mostly hadn\u2019t reached U.S. shores, but Daco had been keeping an eye on the virus in China and told the assembled crowd of economists that in a worst-case scenario, U.S. GDP growth could fall as low as 0 percent in 2020. Some people in the audience were not pleased. \u201cIt got back to me that they thought my estimate was way too pessimistic \u2014 there was no way we would be in an environment where the U.S. economy wouldn\u2019t grow because of the virus,\u201d Daco said.\n\n\u2018We shouldn\u2019t criticize early (COVID-19) models for seeming too pessimistic\u2019: Silver\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what two months can do. Now, with much of the global economy on lockdown, that prediction feels outlandishly optimistic. Daco\u2019s latest estimate is that the economy will contract by 4 percent over the course of 2020 \u2014 assuming a healthy rebound in the last few months of the year.\n\nLargely failing to predict the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, even when it was already wreaking havoc on one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, might seem like a huge mistake. But it\u2019s actually very normal for recessions to catch forecasters by surprise. Forecasters didn\u2019t just fail to predict the global financial crisis of 2008 \u2014 the recession had been rolling along for almost a year before it officially got the label. One study published in 2018 looked at more than 150 recessions across the globe and found that only a handful were successfully predicted by economists. Apparently, professional economic forecasters are an unusually sunny folk \u2014 or at least their predictions are. Research has found that economists consistently overestimate economic growth.\n\nAll of these challenges make sense, when you think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if recessions are black swan events and we should never be prepared for them, but it\u2019s true that they are unexpected and hard to predict,\u201d said Prakash Loungani, an economist at the IMF who studies recession predictions. Forecasting models also rely heavily on historical data, and recessions are rare. Since 1970, the U.S. has only seen seven. And the very nature of recessions make them hard to predict based on the past. \u201cNo model that\u2019s used in normal times will forecast a recession because by definition, it\u2019s a break from normal times,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, the director of macroeconomic policy at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth and a former economist with the Federal Reserve. \u201cSo you have to use your judgment and look at indicators, like the unemployment rate, for clues about what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, each recession is unique, starting with the economic conditions that triggered it. That makes relying on history an even trickier business. \u201cThe last recession was connected to a financial crisis and this one is a public health crisis,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. \u201cThis is one of the problems in forecasting recessions \u2014 the people who are experts on the issues underlying the recession this time are not necessarily the same people who were experts last time.\u201d\n\nOnce a recession begins, similar dynamics usually start to emerge \u2014 consumer confidence falls, the stock market tumbles, the unemployment rate goes up. But assumptions about how recessions will unfold or how long they\u2019ll last may not hold up from one crisis to the next, and it can be dangerous to rely on them. A recent study by Loungani found that in 436 recessions since 1990, IMF forecasters mostly predicted a rapid recovery. (Consensus forecasters had a similar track record, but Loungani had a smaller number of predictions to analyze.) In many of those recessions, to be fair, the bounce back was pretty quick. But overall, Loungani found that forecasters did not do a good job of predicting which recessions would drag on for more than a year \u2014 including the global financial crisis of 2008, where economists predicted that a recovery was coming long before indicators like the unemployment rate returned to their pre-recession levels. That misplaced optimism about a quick return to normal may have actually prolonged the recession, according to research by Loungani and others, by spurring politicians to end fiscal stimulus measures before the recovery was fully in swing.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is making economists\u2019 jobs even harder by taking some of the usual sources of uncertainty and turning them upside down. Unlike in past economic downturns, there is pretty much no debate about whether we\u2019re in a recession. That\u2019s in part because the recession was triggered by the government as it sought to respond to the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the economic problem almost immediately because the public health measures we\u2019re taking created it,\u201d Wright said. That\u2019s helpful in one sense, because it allows policymakers to respond quickly. \u201cBut it seems odd to say it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only reason we know we\u2019re in a recession so quickly is because the shock is just enormous.\u201d\n\nKnowing that we\u2019re in a recession also doesn\u2019t make forecasters\u2019 job easier. In fact, the trajectory of this crisis is even harder to predict because it\u2019s so dependent on external factors, like when shelter-in-place orders will be lifted. Wright said it\u2019s possible to get a reasonably accurate estimate of the short-term economic damage from indicators that update quickly, like weekly unemployment claims, electricity consumption or output from other sectors of the economy, such as industrial production or retail sales. But there\u2019s a lot we just don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how many small businesses will be able to reopen when the lockdowns end. Their ability to start rehiring workers will have a big impact on how quickly the economy can recover. And even rapidly updating statistics, like those unemployment claims, can\u2019t keep up with the breakneck pace of the economic crisis.\n\nDaco, whose company has started issuing biweekly forecasts for its clients, told me that he\u2019s simply expecting to be wrong a lot. \u201cAs forecasters, we have to approach this with a heavy dose of humility, because we just don\u2019t know how this will evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day we could be assuming a 10-12 week lockdown, but the next day we could be looking at a lockdown that lasts through September and you\u2019ve got to throw yesterday\u2019s assumptions out the window.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the forecasts are useless. But Sinclair told me it\u2019s better to think of them as a range of possible futures, rather than a reliable vision of what will come to be. Right now, she said, there are too many unknowns, starting with the question that\u2019s at the top of everyone\u2019s mind: When will it be safe to leave our homes again?", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-works-in-a-grocery-store-but-hes-still-losing-hours/", "published": "2020-04-20T13:40:46", "title": "He Works In A Grocery Store, But He\u2019s Still Losing Hours", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nOvernight stockers at supermarkets were among the first Americans to see how the novel coronavirus might change people\u2019s habits.\n\nCharles Rodriguez, a 26-year-old employee of a supermarket chain in the Greater San Antonio area, had an early indication. Just over a month ago, he walked out of the store to help unload the delivery truck that brought in the next day\u2019s shipment. The sight stopped him dead in his tracks. \u201cIt looked like a holiday truck,\u201d he said, filled to the brim. But it was March 12 \u2014 not Thanksgiving or Christmas.\n\nThe store was preparing for the high volume of shoppers that would flood its aisles as the virus began to shut down many aspects of American life. Still, Rodriguez and his co-workers had no clue how quickly their workload would ramp up to meet the increased demand.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nHe went from working 32 hours a week to eclipsing 40 hours, even earning some overtime pay. \u201cWe\u2019d normally unload two pallets of low-velocity items [like canned foods and peanut butter]. But then we started getting 17 pallets,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWhat was usually an eight-hour shift started becoming nine or 10 hours because of all the extra stuff.\u201d\n\nThat phenomenally busy streak for Rodriguez, who makes just over $15 an hour, went on for two weeks. But then it ended with a thud.\n\nThe supermarket chain started shifting other workers into overnight stocking, both to cut down on paying overtime and to make better use of employees in less essential departments. For instance, it\u2019s neither necessary nor safe for store employees to hand out food samples right now, so instead of laying those people off, the store has them refilling the shelves after closing. Since then, Rodriguez and many others in his department have actually lost hours.\n\nRodriguez said he appreciates his employer finding a way to avoid letting employees go, even if it means that he gets fewer hours and less pay. But it\u2019s been tough for his department. \u201cNow my shifts are closer to six hours per day, and I\u2019m losing about eight hours per week,\u201d he said. \u201cMy co-workers are hurting, and some of the original overnight stockers are kind of upset to have the extra help, because they want to hit their hours.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s only working around 24 hours per week, Rodriguez said he\u2019s been far more conscious about his spending. His lawn mower stopped working \u2014 \u201cThe grass in our yard is really starting to grow,\u201d he said \u2014 but he\u2019s holding off on buying another one as long as he can. Similarly, his 2005 Kia Optima is on its last legs and has required a few trips to the mechanic. Rodriguez and his wife, Hilary, had been saving for a more environmentally friendly vehicle, but they have decided to put off that purchase for the time being.\n\nRodriguez is fully aware of the risks involved in continuing to work as the virus spreads, and his mother is worried about him. But he\u2019s more concerned about what would happen if he lost his job: He would lose his health care coverage, which helps him pay for the medication that treats his hypothyroidism.\n\nBut Rodriguez and his wife are grateful that their situation isn\u2019t worse. They are living at the house of his father \u2014 who is in the military and is stationed elsewhere \u2014 so they aren\u2019t facing the pressure of paying a mortgage or monthly rent. And as Charles\u2019s income has decreased during the pandemic, Hilary\u2019s has increased because of it.\n\nHilary works for a grocery-delivery service, and with people increasingly reluctant to leave their homes, she is fielding almost more orders than she can handle. \u201cBefore, she was happily working 28 hours a week. Now she\u2019s at 40,\u201d and making about $17 an hour, Charles said. \u201cWe basically switched places: She\u2019s making what I got on my old paycheck, and I\u2019m now making what she did before.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to working inside a grocery store these days, it\u2019s that the couple have been able to shop for themselves before or after their shifts, rather than making separate trips to pick over whatever might be left at busier shopping times. Workers can shop before the store opens each morning by showing their employee badges. (There are still strict item limitations, though, to prevent hoarding.)\n\nRodriguez and his wife have a storage bin of essentials in their home, just in case of emergency situations like this. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t touched it yet,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, he hopes that his already-diminished hours at work won\u2019t drop any further. Grocery stores are among the most bustling businesses in the country at the moment, but even the workers who saw that boom coming are worried about the future.", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-22-million-americans-are-out-of-a-job-and-we-havent-hit-bottom/", "published": "2020-04-16T16:07:44", "title": "At Least 22 Million Americans Are Out Of A Job \u2014 And We Haven\u2019t Hit Bottom", "text": "It says something about the astonishing recent run of job losses in the U.S. that Thursday\u2019s number from the Department of Labor \u2014 5.2 million seasonally adjusted initial unemployment claims filed from April 5 through 11 \u2014 counts as a two-week decrease. In the prior week, 6.6 million Americans had filed for unemployment insurance; the week before that, it was nearly 6.9 million. But today\u2019s number still means that a previously unthinkable 22 million unemployment claims have been filed since March 15.\n\nThis decline might signal that the biggest single-week job-loss numbers are behind us, between the initial wave of layoffs and the backlog of people who were unable to file claims earlier because of overloaded state unemployment agencies. But as we noted several weeks ago, economists think there may be 25 million more Americans at risk for layoffs, based on the industries hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. So even if the peak for weekly unemployment claims is over, the chart above could end up having a long tail, depending on how long Americans have to stay inside to combat the coronavirus.\n\nSome states are at different points in that progression than others. If we look at advance claims \u2014 which are reported weekly by state but are not identical to initial claims \u2014 we find that Maine saw the biggest decline week-over-week, with 57 percent fewer claims last week than the previous week. Claims in Michigan, which had seen huge total unemployment numbers, declined by 43 percent last week, more than twice as much as the national average (-19.9 percent).

But it does provide another set of data points for where the biggest increases in unemployment might be happening across the country right now.\n\nSome areas of the country are bending the curve against the virus itself, which is the most important factor for reducing COVID-19\u2019s economic damage as well. But even once new cases are on the decline, the question of when \u2014 and how \u2014 to get people back to work is incredibly complicated. As we begin to move into that phase of the process, the unemployment numbers will recede, but it could be a very long time before they look normal again.\n\nIs social distancing in the US \u2018flattening the curve\u2019?", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-is-wreaking-havoc-on-our-ability-to-make-things-including-vaccines/", "published": "2020-04-15T19:28:51", "title": "How COVID-19 Is Wreaking Havoc On Our Ability To Make Things \u2014 Including Vaccines", "text": "So far, Australia has been doing pretty well in the fight against COVID-19. Using a combination of social distancing, tight travel restrictions and contact tracing, the country has kept its death toll under 100 people and seems to be leveling off its new cases. It\u2019s even managed to avoid closing schools. But despite the relatively minor impact the novel coronavirus has had on life in Australia, medical workers are still running low on masks, gloves and gowns.\n\n\u201cSuddenly it feels like a house of cards,\u201d said Simon Quilty, senior staff specialist at Alice Springs Hospital in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite [run out of personal protective equipment], but we\u2019ve come very close to it. We don\u2019t even have the pandemic. If we do get a pandemic, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nAll around the world, whether hard-hit by the virus or not, countries are running low on crucial supplies. And while shortages are largely confined to disposable medical items for now \u2014 personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, chemicals used for COVID-19 testing \u2014 experts say other shortages are likely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is affecting the way we manufacture all sorts of products, and the way we get those products to where they\u2019re needed. People who study these supply chains have seen problems coming for years. Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/she-was-about-to-start-a-new-job-then-the-economy-collapsed/", "published": "2020-04-13T14:00:33", "title": "She Was About To Start A New Job.

To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nJust over a month ago, things were looking pretty rosy for Laura Buda. After an eight-year run at a midsize arts company, the 32-year-old marketing and communications specialist from Virginia was offered \u2014 and had accepted \u2014 a new job with a much larger organization.\n\nThe new gig would provide not only greater upward mobility for the future but also a higher salary for the present. To celebrate the change, Buda and her husband went on a brief getaway to the Blue Ridge Mountains during the 10-day gap between the final day of her previous job and the first day of her new one.\n\nBut during that hiatus in mid-March, the new coronavirus began spreading aggressively throughout America. Like everyone else, Buda saw schools and businesses shutting their doors in response. And like many other Americans, she began wondering how COVID-19 might affect her new job. Perhaps they\u2019ll push back my start date by a week, she thought, or if things get really bad, maybe a month.\n\nThen, late in the afternoon on Friday, March 20 \u2014 three days before she was slated to begin her new position \u2014 she got a phone call. A member of the company\u2019s human resources department apologized profusely but said that the organization was being forced to rescind Buda\u2019s offer because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nBuda is part of a gray area within the nation\u2019s reeling economy: those who left one job voluntarily for another \u2014 before COVID-19 spread and altered nearly everything in its path \u2014 but who never technically started working at the second gig. People like her are left in the lurch, not knowing whether they\u2019ll ultimately be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nBuda\u2019s husband, who works as an attorney for the federal government, read through the unemployment stipulations carefully and told her he wasn\u2019t sure that her unique circumstances would qualify. \u201cThey ask you to list your last job, and I had to say that I left voluntarily,\u201d said Buda, still waiting to hear back about her filing. \u201cThere\u2019s a small area there to explain your circumstances a little more. But with how many people are filing for unemployment, I\u2019m not even totally sure that part will be read through closely.\u201d\n\nIf she ends up qualifying for unemployment, she estimates that it would amount to about $1,600 per month \u2014 a little bit less than what she and her husband had been paying in child care costs for their 16-month-old son, Dominic.\n\nThere have been some silver linings for Buda and her family, however. Her son\u2019s child care facility \u2014 which has continued to operate during the pandemic \u2014 has allowed parents to pull their children out of day care without having to pay during the crisis. (Some don\u2019t allow that.) And the recent coronavirus relief legislation lets some people with federal student loans temporarily halt their payments, which will save Buda about $450 a month. Perhaps most important: Buda\u2019s husband earns enough to support the family single-handedly. But they will still need to tighten their belts to get through this period.\n\nThe past four weeks have been a whirlwind for Buda. Not long ago, she had planned to buy clothes for the new job \u2014 something her bump in pay would have comfortably allowed. But now she counts it as a blessing that she never took that step. Instead of learning the ropes at her new gig, she spends her spare time \u2014 the time her toddler allows her to have \u2014 sifting through emails notifying her of openings she might be a match for.\n\n\u201cAnytime I\u2019m on the computer, [Dominic] wants to push all the buttons,\u201d she said.\n\nBuda vacillates between looking for jobs and thinking it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand, given the state of the economy. She would love to find something in theater, a field she\u2019d worked in for a long time. But she\u2019s also looking for jobs at nonprofits; she thinks positions with organizations that are untethered to the marketplace seem far more stable now and over the long haul.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who work in industries that, when things reopen, things aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Buda said. \u201cIn theater, people aren\u2019t going to want to engage right away, even if it\u2019s deemed safe. I just think the recovery is going to be so much harder for something like that.\u201d\n\nCheck out all the latest coronavirus polling we\u2019ve collected.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-16-million-americans-have-lost-their-jobs-in-the-past-three-weeks/", "published": "2020-04-09T15:17:54", "title": "More Than 16 Million Americans Have Lost Their Jobs In The Past Three Weeks", "text": "The coronavirus\u2019s record-breaking run of bad economic news continues unabated. Thursday\u2019s numbers from the Department of Labor reported that 6.6 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance, roughly the same as last week (which was revised to 6.9 million) and about double the previous week\u2019s tally of 3.3 million.\n\nAdd it up, and over the course of three weeks, a total of 16.8 million seasonally adjusted unemployment claims have been filed. If we borrow the math from this Justin Wolfers piece in The New York Times last week, that means somewhere around 15 to 17 percent of the workforce might currently be without a job. (For comparison\u2019s sake, that number was 25 percent at the height of the Great Depression.)\n\nThe U.S. has had eight recessions since 1967, including the one we are almost certainly in right now. Of those, four (1969-70, 1980, 1990-91 and 2001) never reached our current level, over 16 million unemployment claims. For the others, it took a tremendous amount of time to reach that level: between 33 weeks (1981-82) and 51 (1973-75). Even in the Great Recession a decade ago, it took 42 weeks to get 16 million total initial claims. This time around, it has taken three.\n\nThis recession is moving at hyperspeed For U.S. recessions since 1967, number of weeks before reaching each benchmark for total initial unemployment insurance claims Weeks before no. of total initial claims Recession of \u2026 3,000,000 9,000,000 16,000,000 1969-70 13 33 Never 1973-75 11 31 51 1980 8 19 Never 1981-82 7 20 33 1990-91 8 22 Never 2001 8 23 Never 2007-09 9 26 42 2020* 1 2 3 *The current economic downturn hasn\u2019t yet met the traditional definition of a recession.

Sources: Department of Labor, St. Louis Federal Reserve, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that the U.S. population has also increased by 66 percent since 1967, meaning there are more workers to potentially file claims now. Furthermore, total initial claims are not equivalent to the number of people who are actually receiving unemployment benefits. And, of course, economists look at much more than just unemployment when determining whether a recession has happened.\n\nThat said, the sheer job-loss numbers for this recession \u2014 and the velocity at which they were amassed \u2014 are difficult to comprehend.\n\nGoing back to previous recessions, some analysts see parallels to the 1981-82 downturn. That recession is considered to have been triggered by changes in monetary policy, when former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. By comparison, this recession was triggered by widespread stay-at-home orders that effectively shuttered countless businesses and put millions out of work. (We should note that economists almost unanimously agree that this was the best decision not only for public health reasons but also for the long-term economy.) Many jobs were lost in the early 1980s, but the unemployment rate quickly dropped after the initial shock, which may provide a model for people to return to work swiftly after the coronavirus crisis lifts.\n\nAgain, though, that early 1980s recession took much longer to reach present levels of jobless claims, so in many ways our current recession represents an unprecedented situation. That\u2019s particularly true when you consider the underlying reason why people can\u2019t go back to work \u2014 a novel virus for which a vaccine is still quite far off \u2014 and the uncertainty around what its eventual timeline will end up being. One thing is for sure, however: Most of us have never seen a recession produce such extreme economic hardship, so quickly, as what the U.S. is going through right now.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/media-coverage-doesnt-actually-determine-public-opinion-on-the-economy/", "published": "2020-04-08T12:00:15", "title": "Media Coverage Doesn\u2019t Actually Determine Public Opinion On The Economy", "text": "In mid-February, Wall Street was celebrating the stock market reaching record highs. But the stock market has since lost roughly 20 percent of its value in the wake of the coronavirus, and the broader economy is in freefall as well. A record number of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and the March jobs report found the economy had lost 700,000 jobs \u2014 the first time that number has declined in a decade.\n\nBut even though large swaths of the economy have shuttered with extraordinary speed, this economic downturn is likely to hit some people and places much harder than others. Those disparate effects, in turn, raise a question that is critical for politics as well as economics: In a country as large and diverse as the U.S., how do citizens know whether the economy is doing better or worse?\n\nOne obvious source of information is the news media. In fact, some political scientists have found that negative news coverage of the economy can shape public opinion, especially in an election year. Marc Hetherington, for instance, found that media coverage in the run-up to the 1992 presidential election was more negative than the economy warranted and cost incumbent President George H.W. Bush support. That could be particularly telling now, considering this is all happening just months ahead of a presidential election, and a strong economy has historically boosted the incumbent president\u2019s chances of winning reelection.\n\nBut in a 2017 \u201cResearch & Politics\u201d article, Eunji Kim, Soojong Kim and I found that the news media\u2019s ability to influence Americans\u2019 perceptions of the economy may be overstated. Our analysis found that major media outlets\u2019 coverage of the economy is much more likely to lag public perceptions than to lead them. That means that the media coverage of an economic recession, like the one we seem to be headed toward, isn\u2019t independently reshaping how Americans think the economy is doing. Instead, we found that media coverage often follows public opinion.\n\nWe used nearly 40 years of data from the University of Michigan\u2019s surveys of consumers, a long-running survey that asks Americans their views of the economy, to create a monthly index of Americans\u2019 level of concern about the economy. We then compared that index to a measure of how 24 different media outlets covered the economy during that same time period, including big national newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post as well as regional papers like the Houston Chronicle. Systematically measuring media outlets\u2019 coverage in nearly half a million newspaper articles and television transcripts proved a bit more challenging. But similar to our approach with the economic survey data, we created an index, this time using words associated with positive or negative economies \u2014 words like \u201cbear,\u201d \u201cdrop,\u201d \u201cjobless,\u201d and \u201clayoff,\u201d as well as \u201cbull,\u201d \u201cgrowth,\u201d and \u201cinvest\u201d \u2014 to score the tone of economic stories published by these outlets.\n\nAnd if we drill down into one of the most prominent media outlets we analyzed, The New York Times, we find no indication that media coverage is shaping public opinion. A telltale sign of media influence would have been if the tone of the Times\u2019s economic coverage shifted before public perception does. But as you can see in the chart below, that didn\u2019t really happen. Instead, the public\u2019s perceptions of the economy more often seemed to lead news coverage rather than lag behind it. For instance, during key moments such as in the run-up to the Great Recession in 2008, the public grew more pessimistic well before the Times\u2019s tone shifted.\n\nIn fact, this was the case across the 24 media outlets we analyzed. There were some outlets for which we found that the tone of media coverage consistently led public perceptions of the economy, but overall, we found no strong evidence that media coverage pushed Americans as a whole to perceive the economy in one way or the other.\n\nGiven how much attention politicians devote to the tone of media coverage, these results may seem surprising. But we\u2019re actually not the only researchers to conclude that public perceptions aren\u2019t heavily influenced by how the media frames the economy. H. Brandon Haller and Helmut Norpoth, for instance, found that citizens\u2019 perceptions of the economy didn\u2019t vary much based on their news consumption habits.\n\nStill, other studies find evidence that the influence can run in both directions, with the tone of media coverage sometimes anticipating public perceptions. For example, Stuart Soroka, Dominik Stecula and Christopher Wlezien found that public perceptions can anticipate media coverage, but also that media coverage can actually lead public perceptions of how the economy has performed but not perceptions of how it will perform. After examining the tone of economic coverage in the four highest-circulation national newspapers, though, Amber Boydstun, Benjamin Highton, and Suzanna Linn conclude that media coverage can predict how Americans view the economy even after accounting for the state of the economy itself.\n\nOn two key points, then, academic research has been consistent: Public perceptions of the economy can get out ahead of media coverage, and public perceptions are also closely connected to actual economic conditions. This suggests that there are critical limits to the media\u2019s influence on public perceptions, which is consistent with other research that shows the impact of elite opinion is often overstated.\n\nIn other words, when the economy shifts directions, the news media\u2019s capacity to reshape public perceptions of the economy is limited at best. It\u2019s easy to pick up a newspaper and assume that its writers and editors can shape public opinion, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be true of the economy. Rather, the public reacts to real-world economic conditions, not media spin.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Dan Hopkins"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-social-safety-net-wasnt-ready-for-the-coronavirus-crisis/", "published": "2020-04-08T11:00:03", "title": "America\u2019s Social Safety Net Wasn\u2019t Ready For The Coronavirus Crisis", "text": "The coronavirus crisis is testing almost every facet of American life, including the country\u2019s social safety net. For generations politicians have proposed (and haggled over) ways to help people during a garden-variety recession. And in the past few weeks, Congress has tried to strengthen the safeguards that already exist, passing a series of bills to get government assistance and other protections to more people, including a $2 trillion relief package with several provisions that directly affect workers and small businesses.\n\nBut most of these benefits haven\u2019t reached Americans yet, even as more and more have been forced to rely on the preexisting safety net. Since the coronavirus crisis began to intensify, FiveThirtyEight has been reporting on which workers are most economically vulnerable, and what the government can do to help. We\u2019d like to continue that by featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience by filling out this form.\n\nToday, we\u2019re bringing you three stories that illustrate a fact of American life that has become abundantly clear over the past few weeks: Our unemployment support systems are woefully underprepared for this crisis. That has caused delays in how quickly help can get to the people who need it most, and threatens to deplete states\u2019 financial reserves. Congress just injected $260 billion into the state unemployment insurance system, and most Americans will eventually receive $1,200 relief payments. Because of the way our unemployment insurance system is set up, many Americans are still struggling to file unemployment claims, and the amount of government assistance they\u2019ll receive will also depend on where they live. In the meantime, jobless workers are scrambling to pay their bills and discovering other cracks in the makeshift social safety net that\u2019s been created to catch them.\n\nWe talked to three young women whose stories show how the response has varied so far.\n\n\u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of an economic downturn never really worried Lee Meach, 29, of Tampa, because there\u2019s always demand for her work as a pediatric occupational therapist, even in a sour economy. She thought it was her husband, Josh Frank, an urban designer who co-owns a landscape architecture and urban design firm, who had the unstable job. But soon after Florida public schools began to close and their county rolled out social-distancing ordinances, Meach\u2019s boss announced that the clinic where she works would be closing its doors for the foreseeable future. She and all her co-workers were laid off indefinitely.\n\nMeach was stunned \u2014 and unprepared. \u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I went from being extraordinarily busy to unemployed in less than a week.\u201d She and Frank had bought a house three months earlier, so she was immediately concerned about how they would pay the mortgage \u2014 much less their student debt. That concern morphed into panic when she began to investigate Florida\u2019s unemployment insurance system and found that the state would pay only up to $275 per week in benefits, just a fraction of what she had been making at her job.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is putting a lot of pressure on the unemployment system and exposing the dramatic variations in states\u2019 relative generosity or stinginess with benefits. The federal government is attempting to standardize how much money people like Meach will receive by tacking an additional $600 per week onto every unemployed person\u2019s benefits for the next four months. But because of steps that some states like Florida have taken to restrict their unemployment insurance program, government aid to jobless workers will still be distributed unevenly.\n\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, Florida was among the states that created a complex patchwork of requirements for jobless workers. The state also capped benefits at 12 weeks \u2014 far below the national standard of 26 weeks. As a result, the share of unemployed workers receiving benefits in Florida and several other states with similar restrictions fell precipitously. In 2019, only 11.3 percent of the out-of-work population in Florida was receiving benefits, down from 30 percent in 2007. That recipiency rate \u2014 the share of unemployed people who actually receive benefits \u2014 is far below the 50 percent experts told us is typical during normal times, although that share usually rises during recessions.\n\nMany of the most burdensome restrictions have now been lifted in response to the coronavirus crisis, which means it should be easier for workers to receive benefits. And in fairness to Florida, states that were distributing benefits to a bigger share of unemployed workers were also unprepared for the recent influx of claims. But even with the additional $600 per week, jobless Floridians will still be getting far smaller payouts than workers in other states, where the maximum payments can be two or three times higher. And that\u2019s assuming the money makes it into their wallets anytime soon. Hours after Meach was laid off, she went online to submit her application to get unemployment benefits, only to be confronted by an antiquated and labyrinthine system online. \u201cYou can\u2019t refresh or you\u2019ll lose all your progress,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me about three hours to figure out where to upload my resume.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she and Frank have scrambled to find other sources of income. He picked up some shifts taking calls and doing administrative work at his father\u2019s small business, while Meach grabbed a few extra hours as a remote lecturer. They also took advantage of their bank\u2019s offer to defer their mortgage payments. Meach finally got her unemployment application submitted by logging onto the website in the early morning, more than a week after she lost her job. By some measures, she was lucky \u2014 Florida\u2019s online system has been functioning so poorly that the state director of unemployment announced last week that his office will start issuing paper applications for jobless workers to mail in.\n\nBut Meach doesn\u2019t feel especially victorious, because she still has no idea when she\u2019ll actually get the money. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot to try to make things work financially,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the unemployment benefits are a big piece of the puzzle for us, so it\u2019s very stressful to wonder when and if that\u2019s going to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nThe bad news started for Chloe Carter-Daves, 21, when she lost her part-time job at a restaurant in New York City in mid-March. It continued when \u2014 after weeks of daily attempts \u2014 she still wasn\u2019t able to submit a claim for unemployment insurance. And it culminated in the discovery that because she\u2019s a student, she won\u2019t be receiving a $1,200 relief check from the federal government like most Americans, even though she\u2019s been supporting herself without help from her parents over the past few years.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans will receive a payment from the federal government over the coming weeks. But college students (and some high school students) fall into a kind of no man\u2019s land: They often don\u2019t file their own tax returns, even if they\u2019re basically self-sufficient, which means they won\u2019t qualify for the relief checks. And their families won\u2019t receive a child payment for them either since they\u2019re over the age of 16.\n\nFor some students who are living at home, that might not be such a burden. But Carter-Daves, a senior at Hunter College, stayed in her off-campus apartment, which means she\u2019s still paying for her own rent and groceries. \u201cI\u2019ll be real \u2014 even when I was working, I was living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d she said. \u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nCutting most college students out of the relief payments could turn out to be a particularly big oversight because young workers are at an especially high risk of losing their jobs right now. As Ryan Best and I wrote on March 18, workers under age 25 are disproportionately more likely to lack both paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. Younger workers are also especially likely to work in the service and retail sales industries \u2014 which have both been among the hardest-hit sectors of the economy.\n\nIf Carter-Daves can get her unemployment insurance claim through, she says she should be OK financially, at least for a while. Her home state of New York has fairly generous benefits for jobless workers. But it was unprepared for the recent tsunami of unemployment claims in a different way. A Department of Labor report from February named New York among six states whose unemployment systems don\u2019t have enough money in their reserves to handle a normal recession. And, so far, the federal government hasn\u2019t taken steps to bail out cash-strapped state and local governments, which means that big states like New York and California are at risk of quickly burning through their unemployment insurance funds.\n\nBut more than two weeks after Carter-Daves lost her job, the website seemed to have become even less functional. \u201cFor a while, the issue was that I would start my application, get halfway through, and then the website would crash,\u201d she said. \u201cNow when I log in, there\u2019s no more option to file a claim.\u201d She\u2019s far from the only New Yorker for whom wrestling with the unemployment insurance website has become a full-time job \u2014 last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo apologized for the site\u2019s frequent crashes and said the state was working on fixing the problems.\n\nIn the meantime, Carter-Daves applied for an emergency assistance grant from her school and got enough money to cover her April rent. But she\u2019s already worried about future bills \u2014 particularly since, as a college senior, she\u2019s facing the dismal prospect of graduating into a frozen economy. \u201cI was planning on leaving the service industry once I graduated,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m going to be grateful if I have any income at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time.\u201d\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis hit, Rebekah Guerra, 26, was already living on a shoestring budget in Los Angeles County. Faced with a mountain of student and medical debt, she moved back in with her parents last year while she tried to jump-start her business as a freelance marketing professional. But over the course of a few weeks in March, any semblance of financial stability evaporated. \u201cI work with a lot of smaller businesses, and they\u2019ve either closed their doors entirely or marketing is not their focus,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t really blame them \u2014 what is there to market if they have no business? But it means my work has completely gone away too.\u201d\n\nUp until recently, freelancers and independent contractors like Guerra were left out of the social safety net for jobless workers, since they don\u2019t usually qualify for unemployment insurance. That changed with the new bill passed by Congress, which created a new emergency unemployment program to cover them. But it could be complicated for states that are already swamped with claims to set up a new infrastructure to funnel funds to freelancers, whose incomes will be harder to verify. There are also questions about which freelancers will qualify, since according to new guidance from the federal government, people who can telework with pay are ineligible \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear what that will mean for people like Guerra, who are theoretically able to work from home but have lost all their business. Experts estimate that it could be weeks before the payments are actually distributed.\n\nAnd for Guerra, any delay could bring her closer to financial catastrophe. She has a chronic health condition that requires her to spend hundreds of dollars a month on medication. And she struggled to pay for her health insurance premium at the beginning of the month. \u201cI\u2019m reassessing my budget \u2014 giving up subscriptions, thinking about things like whether I can go to a lower level of coverage on my car insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nAll of this means that, to Guerra, the prospect of receiving government benefits \u2014 through unemployment insurance or a stimulus check \u2014 feels tantalizing but remote. \u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a financial buffer before this. I understand the system is overloaded and I want to be patient, but my bills are coming due now.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to make a good COVID-19 model", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}]}, "nbpostgazette": {"rss": "http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/", "link": "http://http://nbpostgazette.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/games-like-corruption-of-champions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=games-like-corruption-of-champions", "published": "2020-05-14T04:46:06", "title": "Best Games Like Corruption Of Champions (COC) You Must Play!", "text": "Best Games Like Corruption Of Champions: Corruption of Champions is basically an erotic text-based as well as a browser-based flash game.

More commonly celebrated in the United States than Mexico, the date has to turn out to be connected with the celebration of Mexican-American culture. These celebrations instigated in California, where they have been witnessed yearly since the year 1863.\n\nThe day extended the countrywide acceptance in the 1980s thanks particularly to advertising campaigns by beer and wine companies. In the present day, Cinco de Mayo produces beer sales on par with the Super Bowl.\n\nIn Mexico, the celebration of the battle carries on to be commonly ceremonial, such as through the battle re-enactments or through the military parades.

First, while significantly outnumbered, the Mexicans conquered a better-equipped French army. \u201cThis battle was significant in that the 4,000 Mexican soldiers were greatly outnumbered by the well-equipped French army of 8,000 that had not been defeated for almost 50 years.\u201d\n\nThe second reason is that, ever since the Battle of Puebla held, some have disputed over the topic that no country in the Americas has consequently been attacked by any other European military force. Historian Justo Sierra has also written in his Political Evolution of the Mexican People that on May 5, 1862, Mexico had not overcome the French in Puebla, France would have gone to the help of the Confederacy in the U.S. Civil War and the United States\u2019 fate would have been poles apart.\n\nThe holiday is extensively seen as a celebration of Mexican traditional heritage for America\u2019s developing Hispanic population.\n\nDoes All Of Mexican Celebrate Cinco De Mayo?\n\nNot really, as the people in Puebla only celebrate the day because that is where the unlikely victory was held, but the celebrations aren\u2019t countrywide.

This year in 2020, Cinco de Mayo is going to be celebrated on 5th May 2019, Sunday.\n\nCinco de Mayo History\n\nIn the year 1861, Benito Ju\u00e1rez, who was the lawyer as well as a member of the native Zapotec tribe, was then designated president of Mexico. At the time, the nation was in economic devastation after years of internal conflict, and the new president was forced to evasion on debt expenditures to European governments.\n\nIn response to that, France, Britain, and Spain sent the naval forces to Veracruz, Mexico, challenging recompense. Britain and Spain discussed with Mexico and removed their forces.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use this chance to shape a territory out of the Mexican region. Late in the year 1861, a well-armed French navy captured Veracruz, landing a great force of troops and driving President Ju\u00e1rez and his government into departure.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla\n\nCertain that accomplishment would come quickly, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to outbreak Puebla de Los Angeles which was a small town in east-central Mexico. From his new head office in the north, Ju\u00e1rez curved up a disparate force of 2,000 loyal men\u2014a lot of them either native Mexicans or else of mixed heritage and were then sent to Puebla.\n\nThe massively outstripped and below-par supplied Mexicans, headed by Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, encouraged the town and equipped for the French attack. On May 5, 1862, Lorencez assembled his army\u2014maintained by hefty weapons, before the city of Puebla and headed an attack.\n\nFacts about Cinco de Mayo\n\nCinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of the Mexican army over France at the Battle of Puebla on 5th May 1862.\n\nCinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for Mexico\u2019s Independence Day. The Independence Day of Mexico is celebrated every year on September 16 which is the most significant national holiday in Mexico, honouring the Cry of Dolores, which started the war of Mexican independence from Spain.\n\nNot all the Mexican celebrates the Cinco de Mayo, as the people in Puebla only celebrate the day. The reason behind it is that Puebla is the place where the unlikely victory was taken place, because of which the celebrations aren\u2019t countrywide. Cinco de Mayo is also not a federal holiday because of which the day is just like any other day for most people in Mexico.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla was a part of the Franco-Mexican War. One of the whys and wherefores it\u2019s so important is for the reason that the French army was much grander and more equipped than the Mexican army. They had more weapons and men at their disposal, but still after having all that the French lost the battle to Mexico.", "author": ["Prabhat Singh", "About The Author", "Prabhat Is A Consistent", "Hard Working Content Creator With Specialization In Tech", "Finance Niche.

Then, the lawmakers did not hesitate to question the move that the Trump\u2019s government made. They had their reasons, but that is a matter of another day. Is that possible to paralyze the operations of the space agency? If that becomes a reality, what is the future of NASA? How will they get past that? It is what our piece is all about. For projections, you should keep reading.\n\nDuring the hearings before the panels of Senate and House, two NASA officials came before them. First, there was the manager of NASA who is in charge of the human spaceflight activities. The other one was the inspector general of the same space agency. In addition to that, there were opinions of other experts. The topic of discussion was the fate of the ISS if the White House plan succeeds.\n\nThe proposal begged one question. Can a private company manage all that including the research facilities and the astronauts in them? As the people tried answering that, it became a debate. Points of concern are in the discussion that follows.\n\nThe demand for an orbiting laboratory for a successful commercial venture was of concern. If it was an essential facility, it was unclear as to whether it would operate without receiving any support from the government. There are other questions yet unanswered. They include the necessity of the research of Mars and Moon, whether China will benefit from the step and the feelings of other ISS\u2019s partners regarding the matter. What the cost of flights come in the 2020s is also unknown.\n\nAccording to Paul Martin, he has an answer for one of the questions. The inspector general of NASA said that there a low chance of a commercial operator to entirely manage to operate the ISS come 2025. That does not come as a surprise because the budget as of 2024 will be about $1.2 billion.\n\nTwo senators oppose that move. They are Ted Cruz as well as Bill Nelson. Supposedly, it is not the first time such a thing is happening. In the past, such an incident cost the state billions of dollars and its citizens a lot of jobs. If that lesson will hold waters or not, remain a mystery as of now.\n\nAs we wait to see what unfolds, there are things hard to ignore. For the last thirty years, NASA has invested hugely into the venture. Through design, construction, and operation, the agency has spent $100. Annually, its budget is between 3 and 4 billion dollars. There is so much at stake for a cost that little. The fate will unveil soon.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/there-could-be-a-sixth-military-branch-hints-trump-space-force/", "published": "2020-05-12T11:10:10", "title": "There could be a Sixth Military Branch Hints Trump \u2013 \u2018Space Force\u2019 \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "If Trump\u2019s words see the light of the day, the United States\u2019 security will be tighter than ever. The deduction of a possibility was after a speech. Last month, while addressing the West Point football team, he remarked a space force military branch. During that speech at the White House, he went further to express its function. Once a war would be beyond the atmosphere of the earth, the branch would be in charge of the same.\n\nBack in March while in California, the president highlighted the idea to the members of the military. It has for a long time had support from the Congress. However, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense by the name Pentagon are not for the idea. The milestone would be remarkable. Why not when that would be the first new sector since 1947 when the establishment of the Air Force took place?\n\nAccording to Trump, he was floating the idea. He said that he wasn\u2019t serious about the matter, but it was not a bad idea altogether. The need of the force is because of the enormous amount of work carried out in the space. He acknowledged that he warmly welcomes a possibility of having space corps.\n\nTerry Virts had something to comment on the matter. He said that it wouldn\u2019t mark the beginning of space operations by the military. The source is reliable because Terry once served as a commander of the International Space Station. Equally important, he was a veteran of the U.S. Air Force for three decades. What did he tell Peter O\u2019Dowd of Here & Now? Read on to find out the opinion of this legend.\n\nHis thoughts were as follows. The space department in the force is not a new thing. It is common to countries and states with a stable military, and the United States is not an exception. In the case of the United States, that happened half a century ago. Therefore, it is not about creating a military branch in space. It should be about making the existing one better and productive. In addition to that, military\u2019s organization should be in a more efficient manner.\n\nSince the Pentagon is against it, the chances of its existence are low. The Air Force is already complicated according to its secretary, Heather Wilson. This idea will only make the matter worse. On the other hand, war is taking a different shape. The next one would be in space as far as Rogers is concerned. What happens next is something that all we can do is wait for eagerly.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/spacexs-cost-reduction-is-a-bitter-pill-for-the-ariane-group-why/", "published": "2020-05-12T10:10:10", "title": "SpaceX\u2019s Cost Reduction is a Bitter Pill for the Ariane Group \u2013 Why? \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "SpaceX is very excited and is working tirelessly to make their boosters reusable. That will consequently reduce the cost of the launches. That is good news but not for the camp of the Ariane Group. What is the group about in the first place? The French-based team is a leading contractor for the Ariane 5 launch spacecraft. Equally important, it is working on the Ariane 6 as of now. Why is it not happy with the new development then? Read on to find out more about the situation in hand.\n\nFor years, the Ariane Group has been one of the few favorites that NASA runs to when in need. Did you know that it is the firm whose booster propelled the James Webb Space Telescope? That being a multi-billion dollar project speaks volumes. However, they are afraid that the current state would change. SpaceX is making the launch market extremely competitive, and that poses uncertainty of whether the Ariane Group will survive.\n\nIt is not alone in this. There is also Russia as well as the United Launch Alliance. Nevertheless, they are in a worse position. The reason is that they created the Ariane 6 rocket for one purpose only. They wanted an equal counterpart for the Falcon 9 rocket of SpaceX. The problem is that it is competing with a firm that has reduced the prices of the launch to about $62 million.\n\nWhy can\u2019t they go for that cost then? That is because as much as they would like to, they need to offer a price that will be 25% higher than that of SpaceX when Ariane 6 is ready. In addition to that, they will be prepared in 2020 and not earlier than that. While waiting to do so, SpaceX is through with their Falcon 9 boosters. If they were to offer relatively low prices, where would that leave the Ariane Group? The cost once they have used a Falcon 9 booster could get even less than the first one. That is much to handle.\n\nAlain Charmeau, Ariane Group\u2019s chief executive, made it clear about the frustrations are real. Now there is the United States and Europe competing for the commercial space jobs. According to Charmeau, SpaceX is already at an advantage. Therefore, it will be in a position to offer low prices. Will the Ariane Group survive with such a price margin? That is something that we can wait to see what transpires.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/jaxa-eager-to-join-with-nasa-in-step-by-step-human-space-exploration/", "published": "2020-05-12T09:10:12", "title": "JAXA Eager to join with NASA in Step by Step Human Space Exploration \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is making arrangements to expand human space abuse into profound space in collaboration with NASA.

JAXA is one of the accomplices in the NASA drove International Space station (ISS) and saw ISS as a testbed that can lead to the Moon and in the long run too, Mars. Onishi, who is a resigned business carrier pilot, joined the JAXA space explorer corps in the year 2009 and spent right around four months on board iss IN 2016.\n\nHe is among the nine Japanese space travelers, another of whom, Norishige Kanai, is installed ISS at this moment. Japan, Canada and 11 European nations working under the aegis of the European Space Agency(ESA) have come together with the United States in what is known as ISS since the program started. President Ronald Reagan guided NASA to create a space station in collaboration with different nations in his 1984 State of the Union Address. Japan, Canada, and Europe immediately showed their enthusiasm for joining. In 1988, with the consenting to of an Intergovernmental Arrangement (IGA), they formally moved toward becoming accomplices with the United States in building Space Station Freedom. In 1993, after the crumple of the Soviet Union, Russia additionally joined. The plan was changed for that, and different reasons and the program ended up known as ISS. A changed IGA was marked by every one of the nations in 1998.\n\nAmong research modules on ISS was made by Japan. (The others were given by the United States and Europe.) The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), named Kibo (Hope), is the greatest and the special case that has both a pressurized volume and an unpressurized \u201cback patio\u201d where examine that necessities to introduction to space can be set. JEM likewise is notable as the ISS module from which CubeSats are conveyed into space. Additionally, Japan fabricates and dispatches HTV (or Kounotori) spacecraft that convey freight to the ISS roughly once per year. It is right now building up an enhanced, less expensive adaptation, HTV-X.\n\nTalking at H2M and a workshop sorted out by JAXA\u2019s Washington office, Onishi laid out Japan\u2019s present arrangement for utilizing its involvement with Kibo and the ISS in extending human investigation of room in participation with NASA.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/cygnus-cargo-spacecraft-launched-by-antares-to-iss/", "published": "2020-05-12T08:10:10", "title": "Cygnus cargo spacecraft launched by Antares to ISS \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "On 21st May, a Cygnus cargo spacecraft was launched by an Orbital ATK Antares rocket to the International Space Station (ISS) with an objective, which might be the swan song for the organization as an independent team.\n\nThe launch program takes five minutes and gets completed when Antares get lifted from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, Wallops Islands at 4.44 am Eastern.

Also, the twin solar arrays of this spacecraft will deploy after 60 minutes. As per the official information, the spacecraft will reach the ISS on the early morning of 24th May.\n\nAs per NASA ISS program Manager Kirk Shireman, the launch was simply excellent & amazing. He was at the post-launch briefing and also said that I am very happy with the beginning & progression of this mission.\n\nThe spacecraft carried around 7385 pounds of cargo for the International Space Station that consist of crew supplies, scientific payloads, and hardware for ISS.\n\nWhen it comes to scientific payloads, there is the Cold Atom Lab on the spacecraft. It is an experiment that utilizes lasers for slowing down the atoms before they become completely motionless. It further cooling the atoms to the temperature that will be quite low when compared to the temperature of our planet. Also, it has the Biomolecule Extraction and Sequencing Technology Experiment whose main purpose is to test the tool that makes the sequencing of DNA quite easily.\n\nAdditionally, the Cygnus will be used by NASA for testing their power to boost the orbit of the station. The major part of spacecraft will busy doing a burn late during its stay on the International Space Center and modify the orbital velocity of the station by 0.06 meters in a second.\n\nShireman also stated that the test\u2019s main purpose is to find out if the Cygnus can be utilized again to re-boost the station. He further added that it would open lots of future options for our team.\n\nIt might be the last launch for the Orbital ATK as an independent organization. Last year, Northrop Grumman announced to buy the Orbital ATK for a sum of US$ 9.2 billion.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/china-launching-relay-satellite-geared-towards-moons/", "published": "2020-05-12T07:10:10", "title": "China Launching Relay Satellite geared towards Moon\u2019s \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "China will dispatch the next piece of its goal-oriented automated lunar investigation program on Sunday (May 20).

While tending to chaperons at the NASA representative town corridor, he said that his reasoning had created on the subject and gave out his present convictions. He went further to state that he doesn\u2019t deny the agreement that the atmosphere is evolving. He trusted that the atmosphere was experiencing such a significant number of changes. He said that people keep on engaging in exercises that prompt the discharge of carbon dioxide that goes into the environment.\n\nIts discharge is in substantial amounts, and this goes ahead to demolish the ozone layer. He conceded that as an individual, we should take obligations regarding that.

This arrangement was planned a long time ago, and the move was intended to enable TESS to achieve its last science orbit, a long and circling way around Earth that no spacecraft has ever involved previously. This exceedingly circular circle will augment the measure of sky the shuttle can picture, enabling it to screen substantial swaths of the sky constantly\n\nTESS will perform one final engine burn on May 30 to achieve this circle, they added. The rocket is relied upon to start its two-year science mission in mid-June, in the wake of wrapping up adjustment and authorizing work with its four installed cameras. Such work is as of now in progress. TESS has snapped its first test picture with one of those cameras. The photograph, which was taken on April 26, is focused on the southern heavenly body Centaurus and shows in excess of 200,000 stars.\n\nThe edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the correct upper corner, and the brilliant star Beta Centauri is unmistakable at the lower left edge.

This particular asteroid which was later on named as Oumuamua and was the first interstellar object ever to be discovered in the solar system.\n\nBut it is now found out that Oumuamua is just moving past. The other interstellar asteroid which is known as the 2015 BZ509 is believed to have positioned itself in the Jupiter\u2019s orbit since the inception of the solar system and that was around 4.5 billion years ago. The scientists have just released this data. This asteroid was believed to be identified in the year of 2014 and in November. The shape is in the form of an oddball. One of the most striking features of this space rock is that it revolves around the Sun in the opposite direction to which the Earth, Jupiter and even some other objects move.\n\nIt is still a mystery which is yet to be unlocked that how an asteroid which is orbiting Jupiter can move in a direction opposite to that of the movement of the Jupiter. According to a scientist, if this particular asteroid was supposed to be a native of this solar system, it should have moved in the same direction as that of Jupiter and other objects in our solar system. These space objects are believed to have been formed from the cloud of gas and dust.\n\nHelena Morais who is a study co-author and based out of Sao Paulo State University in Brazil have performed various computer examinations that tried to find out the reason as to why this asteroid is making such reverse movements.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the Sun was formed among dense clusters of stars and came out of the same giant gas cloud.
