If it\u2019s more than five years old, you should definitely replace it. In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission removed restrictions that had limited the wireless transmission power of Wi-Fi routers, allowing new routers to be 20 times more powerful than they were before. Upgrading to a newer router will probably be one of your most life-changing tech purchases.\n\nWhere is my router placed? Ideally, your router should be in a central location in your home so that the signal covers as many rooms as possible. In addition, your router should be out in the open, like on top of a shelf, not hidden inside cabinets or under a desk, to beam a clear signal. You should also avoid placing the router near objects and materials that cause interference, like large fish tanks and metal.\n\nHow big is my home? If you have a home with multiple stories and lots of rooms, and your Wi-Fi is weak in some areas, the best solution is to buy a so-called mesh network system. It\u2019s a system of multiple Wi-Fi access points, including a main router and satellite hubs, that lets you connect multiple wireless access points together to blanket your home with a strong internet connection. My favorite mesh systems are Google Wifi and Amazon\u2019s Eero, which start at $99 for a single router and can be bundled with additional access points. In general, I recommend mesh systems even for smaller homes, because they are fast and very easy to install.\n\nAre my other devices slowing down my connection? Gadgets with slower internet technology can slow down speeds for all your other devices. For example, the iPhone 5 from 2012 uses an older-generation Wi-Fi standard. Newer iPhones, from 2014 and later, use a faster wireless standard. Let\u2019s say you own a new iPhone and your teenager owns the iPhone 5. If your teenager begins downloading a video on the iPhone 5 and then you start downloading something on your iPhone, the older phone will take longer to finish before the signal frees up for your phone to download at maximum speed. As a remedy, many modern Wi-Fi routers offer settings that can give specific devices a priority for faster speeds. Consult your router\u2019s instruction manual for the steps. In this hypothetical example, you would want to give your new iPhone top priority and move your teenager\u2019s old iPhone to the bottom.", "author": ["Brian X.

It was the place that went viral. There were fears about running out of a lot of things: protective equipment, ventilators \u2014 many, many, more patients were dying every day in the hospital than usual. It was a very scary situation. I\u2019m Sheri Fink. I\u2019m a correspondent at The New York Times. Earlier this month, we were able to spend a day at Elmhurst. The number of new cases had dropped, but they had to figure out a new normal. And they also had to deal with the really, really difficult emotions that the staff had after having been in a situation of crisis for many weeks. \u201cIt felt surreal when it was crazy, and it\u2019s real surreal a little bit now I think too.\u201d There\u2019s almost a scary silence because normal operations haven\u2019t started yet, but yet new coronavirus cases have gone down. When coronavirus hit, people were not coming for other emergencies. What doctors are afraid of now is that that\u2019s still the case. People may be dying at home because they\u2019re not going to the hospital. \u201cAnd it\u2019s got the ability to talk to the patients without going in the room. It\u2019s got an intercom system.\u201d They were rapidly scrambling to try to reconfigure. There is a real urgency to get these hospitals back to being able to care for patients who did not have coronavirus. But also, they have to plan for the possibility that there will be another surge. So they are doing things like constructing plexiglass barriers for the registrars. They are taking whole units that were used for treating coronavirus patients, and they\u2019re turning them back into regular intensive care units intended for people who don\u2019t have Covid. These ultraviolet light emitters disperse this ultraviolet light, which can inactivate viruses and other pathogens. Early in the pandemic, they were worried that they didn\u2019t have the equipment that they needed. There was a lot of fear. Now they have an advanced system for having P.P.E., for distributing it. It was very well organized. \u201cYou would have your bleach wipes, your sani-wipes, your gloves and isolation gowns.\u201d There\u2019s a big global demand for it. And so they try to use as little as possible while also staying safe. They\u2019re also still engaged in treating patients with coronavirus. \u201cThe connections between E.T.T. and ventilator are secure?\u201d As the cases were going up, doctors didn\u2019t know, the staff didn\u2019t know how long that would last. It wasn\u2019t clear what kinds of treatments might help. \u201cAll of us were like, we\u2019ll figure this out, and it\u2019s just very frustrating to realize that to a certain extent nobody\u2019s figured it out.\u201d It really has had an impact on them \u2014 just seeing so many deaths and feeling so, so helpless. All around the hospital, there are displays of cards and messages of support. Some people seemed to really appreciate all of the thanks. But I spoke with others who have been telling me they also feel in some ways, that they weren\u2019t able to save everybody. A lot of the health workers are staying in hotels, and so they arrive for their shifts on these buses. There is round of applause for essential workers. That happens every night at 7. And one of the nice things at Elmhurst is that the staff \u2014 they arrive right around 7 o\u2019clock. And so some of these providers walked off the bus, and there was the sound of clapping and cheering, and people honking their horns. And I was noticing that their heads were down, most of them didn\u2019t really look up and acknowledge the applause. They have worked through the peak of this coronavirus, and some of them are exhausted, both physically and emotionally. And they\u2019re also just filled with the sense that they don\u2019t yet know what lies ahead.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/19/arts/design/kanders-whitney-museum-irs.html", "published": "2020-05-20T00:56:56", "title": "Former U.S. Nazi Hunter Seeks I.R.S.

If it\u2019s more than five years old, you should definitely replace it. In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission removed restrictions that had limited the wireless transmission power of Wi-Fi routers, allowing new routers to be 20 times more powerful than they were before. Upgrading to a newer router will probably be one of your most life-changing tech purchases.\n\nWhere is my router placed? Ideally, your router should be in a central location in your home so that the signal covers as many rooms as possible. In addition, your router should be out in the open, like on top of a shelf, not hidden inside cabinets or under a desk, to beam a clear signal. You should also avoid placing the router near objects and materials that cause interference, like large fish tanks and metal.\n\nHow big is my home? If you have a home with multiple stories and lots of rooms, and your Wi-Fi is weak in some areas, the best solution is to buy a so-called mesh network system. It\u2019s a system of multiple Wi-Fi access points, including a main router and satellite hubs, that lets you connect multiple wireless access points together to blanket your home with a strong internet connection. My favorite mesh systems are Google Wifi and Amazon\u2019s Eero, which start at $99 for a single router and can be bundled with additional access points. In general, I recommend mesh systems even for smaller homes, because they are fast and very easy to install.\n\nAre my other devices slowing down my connection? Gadgets with slower internet technology can slow down speeds for all your other devices. For example, the iPhone 5 from 2012 uses an older-generation Wi-Fi standard. Newer iPhones, from 2014 and later, use a faster wireless standard. Let\u2019s say you own a new iPhone and your teenager owns the iPhone 5. If your teenager begins downloading a video on the iPhone 5 and then you start downloading something on your iPhone, the older phone will take longer to finish before the signal frees up for your phone to download at maximum speed. As a remedy, many modern Wi-Fi routers offer settings that can give specific devices a priority for faster speeds. Consult your router\u2019s instruction manual for the steps. In this hypothetical example, you would want to give your new iPhone top priority and move your teenager\u2019s old iPhone to the bottom.", "author": ["Brian X.

There is a real urgency to get these hospitals back to being able to care for patients who did not have coronavirus. But also, they have to plan for the possibility that there will be another surge. So they are doing things like constructing plexiglass barriers for the registrars. They are taking whole units that were used for treating coronavirus patients, and they\u2019re turning them back into regular intensive care units intended for people who don\u2019t have Covid. These ultraviolet light emitters disperse this ultraviolet light, which can inactivate viruses and other pathogens. Early in the pandemic, they were worried that they didn\u2019t have the equipment that they needed. There was a lot of fear. Now they have an advanced system for having P.P.E., for distributing it. It was very well organized. \u201cYou would have your bleach wipes, your sani-wipes, your gloves and isolation gowns.\u201d There\u2019s a big global demand for it. And so they try to use as little as possible while also staying safe. They\u2019re also still engaged in treating patients with coronavirus. \u201cThe connections between E.T.T. and ventilator are secure?\u201d As the cases were going up, doctors didn\u2019t know, the staff didn\u2019t know how long that would last. It wasn\u2019t clear what kinds of treatments might help. \u201cAll of us were like, we\u2019ll figure this out, and it\u2019s just very frustrating to realize that to a certain extent nobody\u2019s figured it out.\u201d It really has had an impact on them \u2014 just seeing so many deaths and feeling so, so helpless. All around the hospital, there are displays of cards and messages of support. Some people seemed to really appreciate all of the thanks. But I spoke with others who have been telling me they also feel in some ways, that they weren\u2019t able to save everybody. A lot of the health workers are staying in hotels, and so they arrive for their shifts on these buses. There is round of applause for essential workers. That happens every night at 7. And one of the nice things at Elmhurst is that the staff \u2014 they arrive right around 7 o\u2019clock. And so some of these providers walked off the bus, and there was the sound of clapping and cheering, and people honking their horns. And I was noticing that their heads were down, most of them didn\u2019t really look up and acknowledge the applause.

They are taking whole units that were used for treating coronavirus patients, and they\u2019re turning them back into regular intensive care units intended for people who don\u2019t have Covid. These ultraviolet light emitters disperse this ultraviolet light, which can inactivate viruses and other pathogens. Early in the pandemic, they were worried that they didn\u2019t have the equipment that they needed. There was a lot of fear. Now they have an advanced system for having P.P.E., for distributing it. It was very well organized. \u201cYou would have your bleach wipes, your sani-wipes, your gloves and isolation gowns.\u201d There\u2019s a big global demand for it. And so they try to use as little as possible while also staying safe. They\u2019re also still engaged in treating patients with coronavirus. \u201cThe connections between E.T.T. and ventilator are secure?\u201d As the cases were going up, doctors didn\u2019t know, the staff didn\u2019t know how long that would last. It wasn\u2019t clear what kinds of treatments might help. \u201cAll of us were like, we\u2019ll figure this out, and it\u2019s just very frustrating to realize that to a certain extent nobody\u2019s figured it out.\u201d It really has had an impact on them \u2014 just seeing so many deaths and feeling so, so helpless. All around the hospital, there are displays of cards and messages of support. Some people seemed to really appreciate all of the thanks. But I spoke with others who have been telling me they also feel in some ways, that they weren\u2019t able to save everybody. A lot of the health workers are staying in hotels, and so they arrive for their shifts on these buses. There is round of applause for essential workers. That happens every night at 7. And one of the nice things at Elmhurst is that the staff \u2014 they arrive right around 7 o\u2019clock. And so some of these providers walked off the bus, and there was the sound of clapping and cheering, and people honking their horns. And I was noticing that their heads were down, most of them didn\u2019t really look up and acknowledge the applause.

Many people in Guayaquil blame the government for failing to slow the spread of coronavirus, and to deal with the thousands of bodies that have piled up in the aftermath. Guayaquil has suffered arguably the worst Covid death toll in Latin America. The thing is, Ecuador had acted earlier than its neighbors to close borders and order strict quarantine. So what went wrong? From the start, the one-two punch of rapid contagion and the ensuing death toll caught local and national officials off guard. On Feb. 27, doctors in Guayaquil diagnosed the country\u2019s first Covid-19 patient, Bella Lamilla, a 71-year-old retired teacher, otherwise known as \u201cPatient Zero.\u201d Dr. Esteban Ortiz-Prado is a medical investigator helping to advise the government on the pandemic. It took 13 days to diagnose Lamilla with coronavirus. And in that time, she infected many other people, including much of her family, pictured here in 2019. In all, three family members died, including Bella herself. After she arrived in Ecuador, Lamilla stayed in the home of her niece, Cassandra, in the town of Babahoyo. Bella Lamilla was certainly not the only case. There were at least six other flights from Madrid to Guayaquil between the time she arrived and when she was diagnosed. Other travelers later tested positive for Covid-19. Those lost weeks led to an out-of-control epidemic. Two and a half weeks after Bella Lamilla\u2019s diagnosis, the country was on lockdown. Two weeks after that, Guayaquil was in the throes of the most aggressive outbreak in Latin America. \u201cIt is true that at the very beginning, it was a disaster. We are learning by mistake, by errors that we made.\u201d This is Dr. Juan Carlos Zevallos. He was installed as Ecuador\u2019s health minister in late March, after the former minister resigned. He admits the government should have tested and tracked patients. But he also blames residents for not following stay-at-home orders after Bella\u2019s diagnosis. \u201cEcuador, as I said, was prepared. I mean, did all the measures in place and very early. Unfortunately, the people didn\u2019t hear us. And they did not obey those restrictions.\u201d Like a lot of cities in Latin America, a large segment of Guayaquil\u2019s population lives day to day, working informal jobs. So to stay home means not eating. It was a perfect storm of factors that left Guayaquil\u2019s hospitals and morgues overwhelmed. Now, the government of Ecuador has another dilemma: Just how to bury the thousands of bodies that have piled up in the weeks after Lamilla\u2019s death? Ecuador\u2019s official Covid death toll is several hundred. But forensic police have been working around the clock to collect and account for thousands more dead. And construction is now underway for various large burial sites around the city. Container trucks like this one transport corpses to one new site on the outskirts of Guayaquil, in the neighborhood of Pascuales. Local residents fearful of contamination are outraged. Officials in charge of handling the dead have promised that each body will have a separate resting place. We attempted to film drone footage of the new burial site. But Ecuadorean soldiers ordered our team to bring the drone down, and temporarily confiscated our footage. A human rights worker documented the incident. Since the first coronavirus diagnosis, distrust of the government\u2019s handling of this crisis appears to have spread as fast as the contagion itself.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/17/us/coronavirus-cases-deaths.html", "published": "2020-05-18T10:21:31", "title": "Illinois Threatens to Fine Defiant Businesses as Reopening Tensions Rise Nationally", "text": "You\u2019re being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession.

If it\u2019s more than five years old, you should definitely replace it. In 2015, the Federal Communications Commission removed restrictions that had limited the wireless transmission power of Wi-Fi routers, allowing new routers to be 20 times more powerful than they were before. Upgrading to a newer router will probably be one of your most life-changing tech purchases.\n\nWhere is my router placed? Ideally, your router should be in a central location in your home so that the signal covers as many rooms as possible. In addition, your router should be out in the open, like on top of a shelf, not hidden inside cabinets or under a desk, to beam a clear signal. You should also avoid placing the router near objects and materials that cause interference, like large fish tanks and metal.\n\nHow big is my home? If you have a home with multiple stories and lots of rooms, and your Wi-Fi is weak in some areas, the best solution is to buy a so-called mesh network system. It\u2019s a system of multiple Wi-Fi access points, including a main router and satellite hubs, that lets you connect multiple wireless access points together to blanket your home with a strong internet connection. My favorite mesh systems are Google Wifi and Amazon\u2019s Eero, which start at $99 for a single router and can be bundled with additional access points. In general, I recommend mesh systems even for smaller homes, because they are fast and very easy to install.\n\nAre my other devices slowing down my connection? Gadgets with slower internet technology can slow down speeds for all your other devices. For example, the iPhone 5 from 2012 uses an older-generation Wi-Fi standard. Newer iPhones, from 2014 and later, use a faster wireless standard. Let\u2019s say you own a new iPhone and your teenager owns the iPhone 5. If your teenager begins downloading a video on the iPhone 5 and then you start downloading something on your iPhone, the older phone will take longer to finish before the signal frees up for your phone to download at maximum speed. As a remedy, many modern Wi-Fi routers offer settings that can give specific devices a priority for faster speeds. Consult your router\u2019s instruction manual for the steps. In this hypothetical example, you would want to give your new iPhone top priority and move your teenager\u2019s old iPhone to the bottom.", "author": ["Brian X.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Nothing so well illustrates Wall Street\u2019s dangerously exuberant state of mind as its triple-digit rally in the wake of Larry Summers withdrawing from consideration to be the next Federal Reserve chairman.\n\nDo you really believe the outlook for corporate earnings suddenly became much brighter just because Summers is no longer in the running to succeed Ben Bernanke?\n\nIf so, I have a bridge I want to sell you.\n\nWall Street is now fully ensconced in that alternate reality in which all news is interpreted as a reason to rally. It\u2019s nice while it lasts, but it probably won\u2019t end well.\n\nIn fact, according to contrarian analysis, this sentiment situation is at the opposite end of the spectrum from the wall of worry that bull markets like to climb. It\u2019s more akin to the slope of hope that bear markets like to descend.\n\nConsider the bullishness that now prevails among the short-term market timing newsletters tracked by the Hulbert Financial Digest. Their average recommended equity exposure right now stands at 56.6%, according to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index (HSNSI). That\u2019s 45 percentage points higher than the exposure level that prevailed just 12 trading sessions ago, in late August.\n\nThat\u2019s an awfully quick jump back on the bullish bandwagon by the typical market timer. In fact, the HSNSI is now higher than where it stood at the market\u2019s all-time high in early August \u2014 right before the stock market\u2019s August pullback (see chart).\n\nThis is a textbook illustration of what happens when Wall Street adopts a \u201cheads I win, tails you lose\u201d attitude.\n\nFormer Lehman employees rock out\n\nIf the market really thought it would be so awful if Larry Summers were Fed chairman, then it should have fallen as it looked increasingly likely that he would be appointed. That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle. Will it be paralysis in Washington over the debt ceiling that causes them to become less exuberant? A worsening of the Syria mess? Most likely, it will be something that comes out of left field that isn\u2019t even on our radar right now.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that, when that souring does happen, the market\u2019s lofty level will not be receiving much support from the fundamentals.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/ayrWz1FSrQE/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-12T19:28:34", "title": "Picking a perfect dividend portfolio", "text": "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, -0.61% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nHidden gems from the '70s\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nThink before you grab those Ivy hunks\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +1.52% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, +2.17% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -0.22% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, +4.66% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +1.66% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +1.75% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, +1.59% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, +1.52% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, +3.03% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +3.46% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +4.31% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, -0.35% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, -0.13% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, +4.26% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-01T11:01:19", "title": "Car companies stuck in slow lane", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

An adviser is deemed to be a \u201ctop performer\u201d if he jumps over two hurdles: First, he must in the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s ranking have beaten a buy-and-hold in the stock market over the last 15 years.

The two auto makers that garner any buy recommendations from the top performers don\u2019t come anywhere close to that kind of popularity: Currently there are 75 other stocks in addition to Pfizer that those top performers like more.\n\nNote carefully, furthermore, that there are no other auto makers besides these four that the top performers like any better. The simple fact is that they are not crazy about the industry, period.\n\nWhat industries do the top performers particularly like right now? The table below shows which have received the greatest number of upgrades in recent weeks from those top performers.\n\n# recent upgrades from top performers Semiconductors 7 Medical Equipment 5 Banks 4 Software 4\n\nAs you can see from the sectors listed in the table, there is nothing even remotely associated with or correlated with the auto industry.\n\nOf course, this doesn\u2019t mean that this industry won\u2019t do well, or that it automatically should be avoided.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nMutual funds take big bite of Apple\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +1.52% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T12:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, +1.66% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nWhy Dow may hit 15,000 in 2013\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T12:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Facebook Inc.\u2019s revenue is growing at a fast pace. But it isn\u2019t growing fast enough to support the social network\u2019s current stock price.\n\nFacebook FB, +6.03% released its latest quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday \u2014 reporting quarterly revenue of $1.59 billion. That brought revenue for all of last year to $5.1 billion. See: Facebook\u2019s results beat estimates\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, for sure, and certainly seems impressive.\n\nTo understand why I nevertheless believe that it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s helpful to review a back-of-the-envelope calculation of Facebook\u2019s valuation that I introduced in a column immediately after the company went public last May at $38 per share. Follow full coverage of Facebook\u2019s quarterly results and conference call.\n\nDoes Facebook have its mojo back?\n\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\n\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 \u2014 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\n\nFacebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in five years\u2019 time. I assumed it would be the same as Google\u2019s is today GOOG, +2.42% \u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s.\n\n\u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s. The rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market\u2019s long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty Images\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T16:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

To set the context of his bet, Apple that summer surpassed Microsoft MSFT, +1.38% to take the No. 2 spot in the market-cap rankings \u2014 and was fast closing in on ExxonMobil XOM, +3.25% as the largest publicly traded company in the world.\n\nAs contrarian investors know, sometimes you need to kiss a frog to find your prince. Reuters\n\nBP BP, +3.09% , in contrast, was on life support as it struggled to cope with the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its stock price had plunged to its lowest in over a decade. Survival was by no means assured.\n\nLike the good contrarian he is, however, Arnott was willing to \u201ckiss the frog\u201d: He publicly bet that BP would outperform Apple over the longer term.\n\nThat was a gutsy bet indeed. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the vitriolic comments my column received for merely reporting Arnott\u2019s bet. Read August 2010 column in Barron\u2019s by Mark Hulbert: Is Apple\u2019s market value too big for comfort?\n\nTo be sure, Arnott\u2019s bet only recently became a winner. But he is today enjoying the last laugh: Since BP\u2019s low in the summer of 2010, it has produced a cumulative real return of 77%, in contrast to 71% for Apple.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time Arnott has kissed a frog. Another came a year after his BP-over-AAPL bet: In August 2011 he predicted that Bank of America BAC, +3.15% would outperform Apple over the long term.\n\nAt that time, it was hard to imagine Bank of America\u2019s reputation being more awful. It represented all that was dysfunctuional about bank and mortgage-company behavior that led to the credit crunch and liquidity crisis of 2008.\n\nEven today it is paying the price for its bad deeds: Its latest quarterly earnings, released last week, were hugely depressed by billions in charges related to the settlement of various legal disputes arising out of the subprime-mortgage fiasco. Read full report on BAC earnings.\n\nIs Apple a value investor's dream?\n\nYet on this BAC-over AAPL bet, Arnott is even further in the black than he is with his BP bet: Since my August 2011 column reporting it, Bank of America stock has produced an 18-month real return of 60%, versus 25% for Apple.\n\nTo be sure, contrarian bets like Arnott\u2019s don\u2019t always work out this nicely. But, more often than not, they do.\n\nWe know this because of the superior long-term performance of benchmarks like Arnott\u2019s so-called fundamental indices, which almost always end up underweighting the stocks with the largest market caps.\n\nConsider the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index, which weights stocks according to a number of fundamental criteria rather than market cap. In the summer of 2010, for example, when Arnott made his BP-over-AAPL bet, Apple was the 27th largest company in that index. It would have been the second-largest company in the index if its weight had been based on market cap.\n\nSince the inception of the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index in November 2005, its alternate weighting scheme has added 1.44 percentage points per year to its return. That\u2019s a lot of alpha to trace to changing each stock\u2019s weight in the index.\n\nKeep that in mind the next time you\u2019re tempted to invest in the latest fad on Wall Street.\n\nWhat frog might a contrarian be kissing right now?\n\nIn an email earlier this week, Chris Brightman, head of investment management at Research Affiliates, suggested betting on Wal-Mart WMT, +0.40% over Amazon AMZN, +1.98% . The latter company may not have the same pizzazz that Apple did in its heyday, but it still represents the allure and promise of the high-tech sector \u2014 especially in contrast to Wal-Mart.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 50% over the last year, triple Wal-Mart\u2019s stock gain of just 17%.\n\nBrightman\u2019s contrarian-based reasoning: \u201cToday, Amazon has a market capitalization of $124 billion, more than half of Wal-Mart\u2019s $233 billion market cap. Yet Wal-Mart is more than five times the size of Amazon measured by sales, cash flow, dividends, and book value. Wal-Mart has free cash flow ... of $11 billion per year to distribute to its shareholders \u2014 which is paid as $5 billion in dividends and $6 billion as share buybacks \u2014 providing a nearly 5% annual yield.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon [in contrast] has only $2 billion of free cash flow and pays nothing back to its shareholders. Amazon\u2019s sales and cash flow will need to more than quintuple relative to Wal-Mart to match Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to pay its shareholders. Anything less, and Wal-Mart is the better investment.\u201d\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}]}, "marketwatch_stories": {"rss": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/newsviewer/", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B0EAFA95A-859A-11EA-8DD8-CACFE6E0C2C2%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-21T00:38:10", "title": "States reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: More beaches, tourist spots open ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend", "text": "Many U.S. states are opening up beaches and other tourist hot spots just in time for the Memorial Day holiday weekend and the unofficial start of summer.\n\nStates continue to lift more restrictions on business and personal activity imposed about two months ago to combat the spread of the coronavirus pandemic.

However, Illinois, including Chicago, now may allow restaurants to open for outdoor dining only at the end of the month.\n\nThe latest developments again show how what\u2019s allowed continues to vary widely by state, as has been the case since the first states acted a few weeks ago, and almost always still includes plenty of restrictions.\n\nSome governors are loosening rules in select parts of their states, rather than everywhere.

Unemployment in April surged to 14.7% as 20.5 million people lost their jobs in that month alone, after the economy contracted at a 4.8% annualized pace in the first quarter. States generally only began shutting down parts of their economies in mid-March, and economists fear second-quarter data will be grimmer than the first-quarter figures were.\n\nIn the weeks since the virus shut down much of the U.S. economy, more than 36 million people have applied for unemployment benefits, though some have since returned to work as businesses reopen.\n\nRead:This troubling chart might change your mind about lockdown restrictions\n\nHere\u2019s what some states have announced:\n\nTexas: Bars across almost all of the state can open at 25% capacity on May 22.

And smaller firms are generally doing even worse than their larger peers.\n\nCase in point: The S&P 500 index SPX, +1.66% index of the 500 biggest domestic companies is down roughly 9% since Jan. 1, but the Russell 2000 index RUT, +2.99% , which excludes the biggest 1,000 firms listed on U.S. markets and focuses on the next 2,000, is down 20%.\n\nWhile it\u2019s true that smaller companies tend to be more sensitive to economic downturns, that doesn\u2019t mean every small stock is down and out right now. These nine companies are doing remarkably well with gains of at least 30% so far this year \u2014 and in one case, 260%.\n\nThese are not microcaps just subject to sentiment swings. They all are U.S.-based companies with average daily volume of more than 400,000 shares and a market capitalization between $400 million and $2 billion. Development-stage biotech stocks are excluded, given the very volatile nature of this subsector.\n\n1-800-Flowers\n\n\u2022 Sector: Consumer discretionary\n\n\u2022 YTD return: 60%\n\nWhen you can\u2019t have in-person birthday parties or make brunch reservations on Mother\u2019s Day, sending some love via 1-800-Flowers.com FLWS, +4.45% is the default option.\n\nSales have surged thanks to coronavirus, but it also has helped that the stock had started 2020 with signs of a turnaround after admittedly disappointing earnings for most of 2019. After hitting a 52-week low close to $11 around Thanksgiving, the stock had topped $14 by New Year\u2019s Day \u2014 and since the worst of the coronavirus fears in March, it has been off to the races.\n\nACM Research\n\n\u2022 Sector: Technology\n\n\u2022 YTD return: 260%\n\nACM Research ACMR, -16.15% provides services that remove lingering chemical and particle contaminants from newly manufactured microchips. This business is incredibly specialized but obviously a crucial part of the tech supply chain.\n\nThis fast-growing small cap is on track to record nearly 30% revenue growth this fiscal year and another 30% in fiscal 2021 if forecasts hold. Profits are set to surge more than 20% this year and 30% in 2021 on top of that.\n\nAtlas Air\n\n\u2022 Sector: Industrial\n\n\u2022 YTD return: 44%\n\nIt may seem dangerous to consider this stock amid talk of possible passenger airline bankruptcies. But Atlas Air Worldwide AAWW, +2.86% is unique for several reasons. The U.S military is a major client, as are private customers who want to avoid public flights. Those business lines remain quite strong. Also, AAWW leases its planes for freight forwarding and \u201cdry leasing\u201d \u2014 a pretty attractive model amid strong shipping demand coupled with cheap jet fuel prices.\n\nWith earnings revisions hinting at solid margins for the rest of 2020 and a recent labor agreement with its pilots union, this small-cap stock could continue to fly high for the foreseeable future.\n\nCelsius\n\n\u2022 Sector: Consumer staples\n\n\u2022 YTD return: 65%\n\nFast-growing \u201cperformance beverage\u201d company Celsius Holdings CELH, +1.14% has a line of zero-calorie fitness drinks that it claims will help accelerate your metabolism and burn body fat. The appeal of this kind of product is obvious, and while the company is still unprofitable, it is plotting nearly 50% top-line growth this year and nearly 30% in fiscal 2021.\n\nMomentum investors love this flavor of consumer growth small-cap with a great story and big numbers to back it up.\n\nConsolidated Communications\n\n\u2022 Sector: Telecommunications\n\n\u2022 YTD return: 38%\n\nSmall-fry telecom Consolidated Communications Holdings CNSL, +5.34% was mostly shunned by Wall Street over the last few years, as it barely operated in the black and boasted a small and stagnant business. However, its multiyear slide changed in a hurry as its rather modest portfolio of about 800,000 internet connections became quite valuable in the era of coronavirus.\n\nBeyond the short-term lift of current customers using more bandwidth, the company promoted some shrewd partnerships with small school districts to help win much-needed attention from new customers and investors.\n\nPredictions are now for a relatively impressive 26 cents in earnings per share in 2020 compared with just 2 cents a year earlier.\n\nGlu Mobile\n\n\u2022Sector: Technology\n\n\u2022YTD return: 60%\n\nYou or your kids may have become rather loyal Glu Mobile GLUU, +2.90% customers in the past several weeks as coronavirus quarantines have prompted many to download time-killing games to their phones. Glu titles include cooking games, fashion games, sports games and even licensed titles with stars including Kim Kardashian and celebrity chef Gordon Ramsay.\n\nThe stock was already riding a strong history of earnings surprises before this outside trend boosted numbers \u2014 and if shut-in gamers stick with some of these titles, the growth trend may stick at the company too.\n\nOverstock\n\n\u2022Sector: Consumer discretionary\n\n\u2022YTD return: 150%\n\nYes, Overstock.com OSTK, +3.74% has given plenty of investors whiplash in recent years. A few years ago, it billed itself as a blockchain company and saw shares surge from around $15 to more than $60 by early 2018. Then it cratered in part because of the antics of its controversial founder and CEO.\n\nNow material growth in its core e-commerce business is in focus again and investors like what they see \u2014 but more fireworks may loom as the company prepares a controversial \u201cdigital dividend\u201d of preferred shares. So far volatility has moved in the right direction for shareholders, however, so this high-octane small-cap remains noteworthy.\n\nPetMed\n\n\u2022Sector: Health care\n\n\u2022YTD return: 40%\n\nThe industry designation of \u201chealth care\u201d may be a tad misleading here, as PetMed Express PETS, +3.78% caters to pet owners looking to order treatments for heartworm as well as common items like cat food, doggy beds and those absurd pet strollers to take critters for a walk without \u2026 you know, them actually walking.\n\nThis stock is at the intersection of some powerful trends, as coronavirus fuels both e-commerce shopping and the need for pet companionship. Throw in the fact that pet spending is approaching $100 billion annually in the U.S., and it\u2019s easy to see the appeal of this smaller and specialized retailer.\n\nUnited Natural Foods\n\nSector: Consumer staples\n\nYTD return: 111%\n\nOne of the more recent breakouts on this list, United Natural Foods UNFI, -1.10% is a grocery distributor with a special focus on natural, organic and healthy products. Organics represent only about 6% of U.S. food sales at present, but that\u2019s good for about $50 billion and steadily growing.\n\nThe short-term boost for in-home foods given by restaurant closures has created a tailwind for this small-cap stock. Throw in a massive first-quarter earnings beat and raised guidance this month, and shares have surged from under $11 at the start of May to more than $18 at present.\n\nJeff Reeves writes about investing for MarketWatch.

The shifts have picked up since Moderna announced impressive data from a Phase 1 trial for a vaccine against coronavirus.\n\nNow investors should look ahead to the post-vaccine world: Sell stocks that are hot today but will experience deteriorating earnings momentum after a vaccine comes out and buy quality stocks with good balance sheets that will experience positive earnings momentum in that new era.\n\nThis chart compares the Dow Jones Industrial Average ETF DIA, +1.44% to seven stocks that I am using to illustrate shifts in money flows.\n\nNote the following:\n\n\u2022 Zoom Video ZM, +1.03% has been one of the biggest beneficiaries of coronavirus. As the chart shows, the stock is up about 140% year to date. As the economy is now opening up and there is the prospect of a vaccine emerging sooner than expected, the price of Zoom Video is beginning to roll over. We believe the smart money flows in the stock are now negative.\n\nZoom Video has gained a lot of free customers. In our analysis, it will have difficulty converting those free customers into paying customers. It also faces stiff competition, has experienced security issues and has an unattractive stock valuation. For these reasons, the stock should be sold. The Arora Report has recently taken a short position in Zoom Video.\n\nRead:Work-from-home productivity pickup has tech CEOs predicting many employees will never come back to the office\n\nAlso:Zoom acquires Keybase as it seeks to boost security efforts\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows in Peloton Interactive PTON, +0.69% also are negative. Peloton has benefited from people staying at home and the closing of gyms. The company reported very strong earnings and recently reached a milestone of 1 million connected users. I believe it will continue to grow. However the present valuation is unattractive and the positive sentiment behind the stock may not stay as positive as the economy opens.\n\nThe Arora Report has taken profits on most of its Peloton position and is now exiting the remaining position.\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows in Teladoc Health TDOC, -2.49% also are negative. Teladoc has benefited from the shift to telemedicine during the coronavirus shutdown. Some of these benefits will persist as the economy opens up but as the chart shows, the stock price is rolling over. The present high valuation is not likely to be sustained. The Arora Report previously took profits on its Teladoc position.\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows also are negative in Slack Technologies WORK, +5.59% . Slack faces stiff competition from Microsoft\u2019s MSFT, +1.38% Team product. The present positive sentiment toward the stock is not sustainable and the stock should be on a sell list. The Arora Report doesn\u2019t have a position in Slack; however it does own shares in Microsoft.\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows are positive in Walmart WMT, +0.40% and mildly negative in Amazon AMZN, +1.98% , two other companies that have benefited from coronavirus. As the chart shows, Walmart and Amazon stocks are not rolling over. Walmart has reported earnings better than the consensus and the whisper numbers. The gains that Walmart has experienced are sustainable. The valuation is rich but justifiable. The Arora Report has long-term positions in both Walmart and Amazon.\n\n\u2022 Smart money flows also are positive in Disney DIS, +4.85% . The company has been hurt by the coronavirus but money is now flowing into the stock. As the chart shows, the stock price is moving higher. The Arora Report bought Disney when the stock fell into our buy zone in March.\n\nWhat does it all mean?\n\nThe intra-market shifts in money flows described above are a positive sign for the stock market because they indicate a shift from stocks which are likely to have decelerating momentum of earnings to accelerating momentum of earnings. The emphasis here is on \u201cmomentum of earnings\u201d and not just earnings.\n\nAs a note of caution, this does not mean that investors should necessarily rush out and buy stocks. From a technical perspective the stock market is very overbought and vulnerable to a pullback unless the second leg of the short squeeze starts.\n\nI extensively use the technique of trade-around positions \u2014 shorter-term positions that surround the core positions, which in turn are partially hedged. Investors should consider separating out strategic decisions from tactical decisions and also short-term trades from long-term investments.\n\nDisclosure: The Arora Report owns shares in WMT, AMZN, MSFT, DIS and has been selling or taken a short position in ZM, PTON and TDOC.

Andrew Cuomo and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio.\n\nBoth groups have been disproportionately affected by the virus in New York City, and new antibody data released by the governor Wednesday further underlined the racial disparities.\n\nOf 8,000 people recently tested across the city\u2019s lower-income neighborhoods and communities of color, 27% were positive for COVID-19 antibodies, compared with 19.9% of New York City\u2019s overall population, according to Cuomo.\n\nIn Brownsville in Brooklyn and Morrisania in the Bronx, two lower-income pockets of the city, more than 40% of people tested had coronavirus antibodies.\n\nGrave racial disparities have been apparent since the early stages of the pandemic, and the rate of death among black and Latino individuals stands at more than double per 100,000 than that of white and Asian New Yorkers, data from the city\u2019s health department shows.\n\n\u201cYou look all across the country, it\u2019s lower-income communities, predominantly minority, where we\u2019re still seeing an increase in the numbers,\u201d the governor said, pointing toward the difficulties of social distancing in high-density public housing developments as part of the problem.\n\nThe state will be expanding the number of testing sites at housing developments across New York City, increasing from eight to 40 locations, and will establish 28 additional testing sites at churches and community-based providers in predominantly minority communities.\n\nPersonal protective equipment, hand sanitizer, enforced social distancing and expanding public health and education will also be provided in the areas, Cuomo said.\n\nThe results of the antibody tests are no surprise and show a failure on the part of officials, according to New York City\u2019s Public Advocate, Jumaane D. Williams.\n\n\u201cToday\u2019s data once again confirms what we already knew, and what I\u2019ve stated repeatedly\u2014New York\u2019s lower-income neighborhoods of more color are epicenters within the epicenter of this crisis,\u201d Williams said in a statement. \u201cThis devastating outcome is the result of delayed and inadequate responses by the city, state, and federal government that put New Yorkers with less privilege at greater risk on the front lines without a plan for protection, and perpetuates longstanding systemic failures.\u201d\n\nInfections and fatalities will continue at disproportionate rates \u201cunless we expand and expedite efforts to combat the virus in these communities,\u201d according to Williams. \u201cWhile I\u2019m glad to see the governor now take additional steps to address these disparities, it does not make up for lost time or lost lives.\u201d\n\nThe push toward more testing comes on a day when key coronavirus indicators are \u201cheaded in the right direction,\u201d according to Cuomo. \u201cHospitalizations are down, net change in hospitalizations are down, intubations are down again. Number of new cases down. But it was a long road down.\u201d\n\nConditions have improved enough that religious gatherings of no more than 10 people and drive-in and parking lot services will be able to resume statewide on Thursday, in accordance with strict social distancing and mask wearing, the governor said.\n\nSee: Glimmers of a new normal\u2014including drive-in movies, time at the beach and a possible restart to local sports\u2014start to show in New York\n\nIn total, there have now been 22,976 coronavirus fatalities across the state. On Tuesday alone, 112 people died from the virus, 30 of whom were nursing home residents.\n\n\u201cThis crisis has clearly been so tough on the oldest New Yorkers, and it has shown us, once again, we have to redouble our efforts to help those who are most vulnerable,\u201d Mayor Bill de Blasio said Wednesday.\n\nStarting next week, on-site testing will be provided at New York City\u2019s 169 nursing homes.\n\n\u201cAs many test kits as the nursing home needs, we will provide,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cWe\u2019re working with a lab to do the processing, so this\u2019ll be a dedicated effort focused on the nursing homes, all 169 of them, and whatever amount of tests they need, whatever amount of lab capacity they need, we will find it for them.\u201d\n\nAlso read: With heavy personnel losses, New York City\u2019s transit system keeps moving\n\nIf every nursing home tests consistently, they\u2019ll be collectively administering about 3,000 tests a day, according to the mayor.\n\nThere have been 1,267 confirmed COVID-19 deaths in New York City\u2019s nursing homes, and another 1,815 fatalities are presumed to be a result of the virus, according to the state\u2019s health department.\n\nThe mayor also pledged to fill staffing gaps in facilities resulting from quarantines.\n\n\u201cAnyone who tests positive who works in a nursing home has to stay away for 14 days.

I think the only question now is can we pass it as a clean bill.\u201d\n\nRubio said \u201cDemocrats or someone else\u201d could \u201cinsist that we add something else to it beyond just that provision,\u201d but he wants action just on the one issue before the Senate goes on a break for Memorial Day week.\n\nRestaurant executives on Monday pressed President Donald Trump to extend the deadline to 24 weeks, and he said their request was \u201cvery reasonable.\u201d Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said there was bipartisan support, but going to 24 weeks might not happen.\n\nHouse Democrats\u2019 $3 trillion aid package that passed Friday also includes an extension, an elimination of the 75% rule and other changes to the PPP, but that broad measure is overall a non-starter for Republican lawmakers.\n\nThe PPP was established in late March and has received $670 billion in funding through the $2.2 trillion CARES Act and April\u2019s $484 billion relief package.

When Trump was a candidate for the presidency in 2016, he refused to say that he would accept election results if he lost. At the time, Republican strategist Steve Schmidt described this as \u201ca moment of clear and present danger to our constitutional order, to the republic.\u201d Scholars recognize the baseless refusal to accept legitimate election results as an authoritarian warning sign.\n\n\u201c Trump will do whatever he thinks it will take to remain in office \u2014 if he can get away with it. \u201d\n\nNow, as president, Trump has real power at his disposal. For Trump, rules are for the \u201clittle people\u201d (to paraphrase his one-time New York real estate rival, Leona Helmsley). We should expect that Trump will do whatever he thinks it will take to remain in office \u2014 if he can get away with it. For example, Trump has suggested that former President Barack Obama and presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden should both be jailed. In ordinary times, it would be close to unthinkable for a sitting president to make such wildly unsupported claims \u2014 and, if one did, we would expect bipartisan denunciations of such threats. In our upside-down times, we know that Republicans will remain silent.\n\nIn planning for one possible contingency, legal scholars convened recently to discuss what would happen if the election results are disputed this year. The scholars are concerned about a possible \u201cconstitutional meltdown if [Trump] and his most strident partisan allies seek to disrupt or disregard counting votes and the transfer of presidential power.\u201d\n\nRead: Trump threatens Michigan, Nevada over mail-in voting\n\nNone of this is reason for despair. Indeed, there may be a tendency to overestimate Trump\u2019s ability to dictate results. Just because Trump believes he can get away with something doesn\u2019t necessarily mean he can. For instance, Trump tried to secretly pressure Ukraine\u2019s president to illicitly tip the dynamics of the 2020 election in his favor. But Trump was caught, he was impeached, and even though he remains in office, the scandal cast yet another cloud over his troubled presidency.\n\nJust as it is a mistake to see Trump as an all-powerful figure who can undermine elections at his whim, it is also a mistake to ignore the threat Trump poses. Clearly he does not feel bound by norms or even rules that support U.S. constitutional democracy. We also know that the systemic checks we generally assume will function to set limits on presidential power have often not worked when it comes to Trump.\n\nWe know who Trump is and what he is capable of trying. Accordingly, Americans should be on guard to defend U.S. democracy against the next possible steps Trump may take to undermine it. Actions to take include:\n\nReporters should ask Trump whether he thinks he has the authority to postpone the election, whether he still believes, as he did in 2016, that he does not have to accept the results if he loses, and whether he believes that Obama, Biden, or other political opponents can be jailed. The point is not that anyone should expect Trump to say the right thing\u2014it is to get Trump on the record.\n\nRepublican members of Congress should be asked the same questions. These could be hard questions for Republican senators in tight election races (e.g. Maine, Colorado, Arizona). Getting some Republicans on the record (perhaps Utah Senator Mitt Romney) to say that Trump does not have this authority would certainly help.\n\nProminent Republicans who are not in office \u2014 for example, George W. Bush, Bob Corker, Nikki Haley \u2014 should express their support for our constitutional democracy. They should make clear to voters that Trump cannot postpone the election, cannot baselessly reject its results if he loses, and cannot order the jailing of his political opponents. This could help put pressure on current Republican members of Congress and could send a message to the public that these are not ordinary partisan issues.\n\nOur democracy does not function automatically, nor is it invulnerable to efforts to undermine it. Whether it succeeds and endures is up to all of us.\n\nChris Edelson is an assistant professor of government in American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs.

Nearly 39 million workers have lost their jobs in the effort to slow COVID-19, and many of those who kept working in \u201cessential\u201d jobs have been sickened by the deadly virus.\n\nThe unemployment rate for workers with only a high school diploma was 17.4% in April, more than twice the rate for workers who have a degree, many of whom are working from home and complaining about how boring Zoom is.\n\nWe\u2019ve been locked down for two months, but too little has been done to make sure that when businesses did reopen, it would be safe for the workers to come back.\n\nBusinesses have put a lot of effort into making consumers feel safe, which totally makes sense from a business point of view. Customers are scarce, but workers are not.\n\nBut if workers can\u2019t be safe too, then the coronavirus would begin to spread rapidly again, leading to a second peak deadlier and more widespread than the first. The economy would contract again, as consumers and workers stay home.\n\nOne study out of Scandinavia concludes that most of the economic contraction stems from voluntary behavior to stay safe, not from government orders. Polls show most Americans are still leery of being too close to lots of people.\n\nMonitor the economy\u2019s progress in MarketWatch\u2019s Coronavirus Recovery Tracker\n\nOpportunity was squandered\n\nWe\u2019ve been presented with a false choice: Either endure many more months of lockdowns and comatose economic activity, or reopen everything and pretend the virus will magically go away.\n\nThere is no ideal path forward, but there is a third way that cherishes both lives and the economy. Of course, every business that can reopen safely should do so, but at the same time we must maintain our efforts to limit infections until scientists invent vaccines and effective therapies.\n\nI agree with Andy Slavitt, Mark McClellan and 21 other public health experts who wrote in USA Today: \u201cWe want a good economy and public safety, but we are afraid if we open too quickly, or don\u2019t have plans to adjust if spread recurs, we will have neither.\u201d\n\nIn many ways, we aren\u2019t ready to send everybody back to work. We don\u2019t have enough testing, we don\u2019t do enough contact tracing, and we don\u2019t effectively isolate those who are infectious.\n\nWorst of all, we\u2019ve got a large number of people actively resisting doing anything that might keep others safe, such as keeping their distance or wearing a mask. The most dangerous people in America are those who encourage us to believe it\u2019s a virtue to ignore common sense and medical advice. The red pill won\u2019t protect us, and neither will hydroxychloroquine.\n\nInstead of giving businesses advance guidance on how to operate safely, the federal government told them to wing it. The clear message from the White House and Treasury secretary is that the health of the American people should take a back seat to economic growth. Detailed guidelines from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention were censored by the White House, and finally released without fanfare on Tuesday, after many businesses had already reopened.\n\nRead:States continue to reopen after coronavirus lockdowns: Texas leads string of moves ahead of Memorial Day holiday weekend\n\nWorkers\u2019 voice\n\nThe CDC guidelines, which are nonbinding, won\u2019t get any rhetorical support from President Donald Trump and will be soon forgotten. The Trump administration has refused to adopt any rules to ensure that workers are not exposed to infectious diseases. There\u2019s been little attempt to make sure that each industry is developing and following best practices for workers\u2019 safety.\n\nIt\u2019s not completely hopeless. Many small businesses are doing the right thing because the owners are also the workers. Industries that are heavily unionized \u2014 the Las Vegas casinos and the Detroit auto makers for example \u2014 seem to have listened to their workers\u2019 concerns.\n\nAlso read:Ford temporarily halted production in Chicago plant because of COVID-19 cases\n\nBut most workers have no voice in the matter. If their employer calls them back from a furlough, they must go or they\u2019ll lose their unemployment check AND their job and their health insurance (if they should be so lucky).\n\nIf workers believe that working conditions are too risky, they have few options but to quit. The federal agency that\u2019s supposed to protect workers on the job, the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, has announced that it will not get involved. The AFL-CIO filed suit on Monday against OSHA, demanding that it protect workers.\n\nEndangered workers could sue their employer for operating a death trap, but such lawsuits rarely succeed.

He thinks \u201cAmericans on the front lines of this fight must receive strong protections from [wait for it] frivolous lawsuits.\u201d\n\nSilly me, I thought Americans on the front lines needed protections from the coronavirus. But you and I know the real scourge that must be eliminated is the hard-won regulations that protect workers and the public.\n\nThousands of workers infected\n\nWe already know what the risks are of working in an unsafe environment. In workplaces that have remained open during this early period of the pandemic, thousands of workers have been infected and many have died. Meatpacking plants, nursing homes, prisons, public transportation and hospitals have been particularly dangerous places to work.\n\nThe danger will now spread to reopened factories, offices, stores, schools, churches and other places of business around the country, unless they are first required to show that they\u2019ve done all that\u2019s reasonable to ensure that their workplace is safe.\n\nPeople are desperate for income, and many will take the paycheck even if it comes with higher risk of becoming infected and spreading a terrible disease to their loved ones.\n\nNo one should have to make that choice when we can do better.\n\nThe people on the front lines get it \u2014 that\u2019s why there have been many protests at work places around the country demanding that safety come before profits. You probably haven\u2019t seen in on the news, because these protesters aren\u2019t heavily armed and don\u2019t have deep-pocket sponsors to spread the word on social media.\n\nI get it \u2014 it can be expensive to make social distancing possible in a kitchen or a factory floor.

That's generally true, but the CARES Act carved out a few reasons someone can refuse a job offer and still collect benefits \u2014 needing to care for a sick family member or a child whose school has closed, for example.

Not only did the deal costs explode, but the cleaning process used by the machines to sanitize the masks may actually damage them and prevent them from being reused.The machines were supposed to allow masks to be reused up to 20 times through sanitizing treatments. However, scientists and nurses say that masks cleaned by the machines began to degrade after two or three treatments, putting them at risk. \"They keep saying these recycled masks are still safe after all these cycles, but we don't know that,\" said a nurse in Pennsylvania, whose hospital has used the machines. \"What we do know is that there are not enough masks for medical workers and there are very real consequences if we get sick.\" \u2014Hannah Miller\n\nHere are 8 new, in-demand jobs created by the pandemic\n\n2:30 pm ET \u2014 You've probably heard about the millions of jobs destroyed by the coronavirus. But the pandemic has also created many new jobs. As companies consider how to bring their employees back into offices in the safest way possible, many are hiring temperature screeners and Covid-19 testers. Meanwhile, video platform support specialists are needed to help people carry out their remote weddings and work conferences. Here are the jobs borne out of the pandemic. \u2014Annie Nova\n\nGlobal daily cases increased by most ever, WHO says\n\n2:24 ET pm ET \u2014 Countries around the world collectively reported more new cases to the WHO in the past 24 hours than ever before, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said.

Apple and Google won't make the actual contact tracing apps \u2014 government health bodies will. Alabama, North Dakota and South Carolina are the first states to commit publicly to using the system in the United States.The technology is designed to slow the spread of coronavirus by tracking who a person has been in close contact with, using Bluetooth processed on the device, instead of GPS location tracking and central databases. But whether users adopt the apps remains an open question: The more phones that opt-in to the system, the more successfully it can detect how the virus spreads. \u2014Kif Leswing\n\nAntibody testing shows coronavirus is still spreading in low-income, minority communities in NYC\n\n1:55 pm ET \u2014 New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said that the coronavirus is still spreading through New York City's low-income, predominantly minority communities when compared with the general population. According to results from approximately 8,000 antibody tests conducted by Northwell Health in New York City, Bronx had the highest percentage of positive tests at 34%. Meanwhile, New York City overall had a positive rate of nearly 20%. The state partnered with faith-based communities in lower-income, predominantly minority communities to conduct the antibody testing, which found that 27% of people in the group tested positive.\"The spread is continuing in those communities and that's where the new cases are coming from,\" Cuomo said. \"What we're seeing in New York City is going to be true across the state.\" \u2014Jasmine Kim\n\nWith surge in online sales, Walmart speeds along launch of new smartphone app\n\n1:40 pm ET \u2014 As more customers shop online during the pandemic, Walmart sped along the launch of a new smartphone app to make those purchases easier and nudge shoppers towards adding higher margin items to their virtual baskets. The big-box retailer's e-commerce sales jumped by 74% in the first quarter, as customers flocked to Walmart for everything from pasta sauce to bicycles. The company said it's attracting new customers who are trying online services like curbside pickup for the first time.Before the pandemic, Walmart planned to combine its two apps to blend together groceries and general merchandise, such as home decor and fashion. It decided to launch that app this week -- about six months ahead of schedule, said Janey Whiteside, Walmart's chief customer officer.She said the app includes a feature that's become popular during the pandemic: Walmart Pay. It allows customers to check out without having to touch a screen at the register. \u2014Melissa Repko\n\nTrump pulling funds from WHO may hurt emergency program\n\nIn this photo illustration the World Health Organization Director General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus is seen on a screen of pc and a coronavirus image displayed on a screen of a smartphone in Kiev, Ukraine. Pavlo Gonchar | SOPA Images | Getty Images\n\n1:22 pm ET \u2014 President Donald Trump permanently pulling U.S. funds from the World Health Organization could hurt the agency's emergency programs for poor nations, WHO officials warned. The agency's budget is already \"very, very small\" at about $2.3 billion a year, WHO Director-General Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said. Most funding from the United States goes directly out to the program that helps \"some of the most vulnerable people in the world,\" Dr. Mike Ryan, executive director of WHO's health emergencies program, told reporters. The WHO's funding runs in two-year budget cycles. For the 2018 and 2019 funding cycle, the U.S. paid a $237 million required assessment as well as an additional $656 million in voluntary contributions to the agency, averaging $446 million a year and representing about 14.67% of the WHO's total budget, according to spokesman Tarik Jasarevic. \u2014Berkeley Lovelace Jr.\n\nRicky Sandler says herd immunity is the best way to ease 'civil unrest' from pandemic restrictions\n\n1:08 pm ET \u2014 Hedge fund executive Ricky Sandler has told his associates that he's now in favor of herd immunity as a way to combat the coronavirus. In a letter to friends, Sandler, who lost billions at the start of social distancing protocols, argues that the tactic will be the best way to avoid \"civil unrest.\" \"With proper coordination, I can envision Artists hosting virus relief concerts where young and healthy people go and hopefully get the virus and then the antibodies which allow them to donate blood to be used as a treatment or a prophylactic,\" Sandler wrote. Faculty at the Johns Hopkins School of Public Health made a case against that approach in April. \"For less severe diseases, this approach might be reasonable. But the situation for SARS-CoV-2 is very different: COVID-19 carries a much higher risk of severe disease and even death,\" two Johns Hopkins staffers wrote. \u2014Brian Schwartz\n\nHow PVH is managing shopping experience as its stores reopen\n\n12:55 pm ET \u2014 PVH, owner of Calvin Klein and Tommy Hilfiger, is offering customers face masks upon entry to its stores, as well as putting returned clothes in quarantine for a few days, CEO Manny Chirico told CNBC.

The plant, according to the company, reopened Wednesday after work areas were deep cleaned and disinfected. The brief closures on separate shifts Tuesday are the first-known type of incidents since Detroit automakers started reopening their large North American assembly plants on Monday. The plants were shuttered in March for employee safety and to lower the potential spread of the virus. Ford said the employees did not contract the coronavirus while at work, citing the incubation time of the virus. Ford and other automakers reopening plants have implemented stringent protocols to assist in lowering the chance of spreading the disease, as well as protocols such as pre-work questionnaires and temperature screenings to identify those who may be at higher risk of contracting Covid-19. \u2014Michael Wayland\n\nUnited's new CEO doesn't expect a full recovery in travel demand without a vaccine\n\nPassengers, some wearing masks and protective gear, queue for their flight at Terminal 1 of John F.

So we are preparing United to go through a time of depressed demand, pretty significantly depressed demand for a long period of time so that we make sure we are here and as soon as the vaccine is in place that we can bounce back quickly\" Kirby told CNBC's Squawk Box. TSA data show the number of people passing through U.S. airport checkpoints is down more than 91% from a year ago. United on Wednesday announced it is working with Clorox and the Cleveland Clinic on guidelines for cleaning protocols and social distancing measures for passengers. Kirby, who has been United's president since August 2016, said he's hopeful the carrier can negotiate pay or other changes with labor unions that represent more than 80% of United's 96,000 employees, to avoid layoffs this fall. \u2014Leslie Josephs\n\nHow scammers are targeting Americans during the pandemic\n\n12:02 pm ET \u2014 Nearly 50,000 Covid-19 related scams were reported to the Federal Trade Commission's Consumer Sentinel Network as of this week.

The number of Americans filing for unemployment benefits has risen to nearly 36.5 million, the biggest loss in U.S. history. But while 78% of out of work individuals describe themselves as temporarily laid off, new research suggests for many the job losses will be permanent, CNBC's Rahel Solomon reports. The University of Chicago's Becker Friedman Institute estimates 42%, or about 11.6 million, of all jobs lost through April 25 due to the coronavirus will be gone for good. \"The current crisis may be so severe that the fraction of temporary layoffs that become permanent ends up being much larger than the historical evidence would suggest,\" co-author Jose Maria Barrero said in an email. \u2014Terri Cullen\n\nRemote learning could be here to stay\n\nRobert Schachter, a parent of an NYC public high school student and a college student, bought bridge tables so his kids could have space for remote learning while schools were closed due to the coronavirus. Robert Schachter\n\n10:32 am ET \u2014 The coronavirus crisis laid bare how ill-prepared most schools were when it came to remote learning. Now, a growing number of schools are committed to adopting a \"hybrid\" model to education in and outside the classroom going forward. Students will likely see smaller classes and staggered scheduling, which could include alternating days of the week or times of the day, to help limit the number of people physically present in a building at any time That means kids will spend much less time in brick-and-mortar classrooms in the years ahead. \"Despite the clamor and the complaints about it, remote learning is going to be here to stay,\" said Mayssoun Bydon, founder and managing partner of The Institute for High Learning, or IHL Prep, an educational consulting firm. \u2014Jessica Dickler\n\nAs U.S. reopens, companies brace for a flood of workplace lawsuits\n\n10:24 am ET \u2014 States are gearing up to slowly reopen their economies and companies of all sizes, especially small businesses, are worried about the liability risks. \"There is no playbook for this,\" said Harold Kim, president of the U.S. Chamber Institute for Legal Reform. \"Litigation is particularly damaging to Main Street because the level of potential damages can close down your doors.\" He anticipates a surge in worker liability lawsuits as coronavirus infection rates tick up. Recognizing the issue there is bipartisan debate on federal and state levels to limit liability. Most of the proposals focus on limiting liability from customers. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, R-Calif., said liability protections for doctors and businesses are the top priority for GOP leaders: \"No bill will pass without it,\" he said speaking Tuesday on CNBC. Anticipating the coming flood of suits, employers are developing workplace safety precautions including additional cleaning measures, conducting temperature checks of workers and requiring that all employees wear masks or other face coverings at work. \u2014Lori Ioannou\n\nCoca-Cola CEO says he expects a 'U'-shaped economic recovery\n\n9:44 am ET \u2014 Coca-Cola CEO James Quincey said he's expecting a long road to recovery for the economy. \"The economic impact of the lockdown is just starting to begin,\" Quincey said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\" Countries around the world are easing shelter-at-home orders and letting businesses gradually open. But Quincey said he's forecasting a \"U\"- or \"extended U\"-shaped recovery rather than one shaped like a \"V,\" where the economy quickly snaps back to pre-crisis activity.

However, it is difficult to compare reported earnings to analyst estimates for L Brands' first quarter, as the coronavirus pandemic continues to hit global economies with earnings impacts that are difficult to assess.\n\nThe company announced Wednesday, in a separate securities filing, that current COO Charles McGuigan is stepping down.\n\nMeantime, L Brands said it still remains committed to make Bath & Body Works a \"pure-play public company,\" with Victoria's Secret operating as another standalone business.\n\nWith its distressed lingerie business, it said it plans to focus on managing inventory and selling more items at full price. It has named current L Brands CFO Stuart Burgdoerfer as interim CEO of Victoria's Secret. It said it expects to permanently shut roughly 250 Victoria's Secret and PINK stores across North America this year.\n\nL Brands on May 4 announced it struck an agreement with private-equity firm Sycamore Partners to terminate its Victoria's Secret deal. Sycamore had previously agreed to acquire a 55% share in Victoria's Secret for $525 million, which would have allowed the lingerie brand to go private.\n\nHowever, Sycamore Partners tried to end its deal with L Brands in April, citing store closures and missed rent payments during the pandemic. L Brands said it struck a termination agreement earlier this month to avoid \"costly and distracting litigation to force a partnership with Sycamore.\"\n\nL Brands' goal, with the split, is to allow its stronger soap and fragrance business to grow without being weighed down by its struggling bra business.

Speakers included MC Hammer, political commentator Van Jones, writer and activist Shaka Senghor and venture capitalists Marc Andreessen and Ben Horowitz. Despite the big names, only about 1,500 people, mostly with ties to prominent tech investors, had access to the chat. Clubhouse is the buzzy new social app of 2020, freshly valued at $100 million after a reported $12 million in funding from Andreessen Horowitz. There's no website yet, and the founders, Paul Davison and Rohan Seth, have stayed out of the press. Their LinkedIn profiles say they started Alpha Exploration Co., the parent company of Clubhouse, earlier this year. Those in the exclusive beta group describe the Clubhouse experience as a mashup of listening to a podcast while scrolling through your Twitter feed and attending a conference remotely. Upon launching the app, they see a few virtual rooms with the names of the people in them. Sometimes there are two participants, occasionally there are 100. When they enter a room, the audio switches on and they can hear people speaking \u2014 it's like walking into a conference room where a panel or Q&A is happening. The room's creator can decide who gets to speak.\n\nClubhouse screenshot\n\nBilal Zuberi, a partner at venture firm Lux Capital, said Clubhouse is the only social audio app that's captured his interest. \"Almost all social media requires us to look at a screen,\" said Zuberi, whose firm has offices in New York and Menlo Park, California. \"This is the first one where I'm not looking at a screen. I'm involved in social media but I'm sitting by the pool with my kids and as long as I'm muted and not speaking, it's great.\" Clubhouse is keeping a tight lid on invites, with only a dozen or so new people joining a day. The average number of daily users is currently about 270, or roughly 18% of the total number of signups, according to a person close to the company. Davison will commonly hop into a room for a few minutes to ask the participants for feedback on a particular feature. Zuberi said a senior executive at Uber invited him a few weeks ago. He estimates he now spends about half an hour per day listening to conversations, and sometimes participating. While cooking dinner on Monday night, he was one of about 100 people listening to the discussion on race that featured MC Hammer and other well-known voices. Felicia Horowitz, Ben's wife and the founder of the Horowitz Family Foundation, was also a participant, tweeting afterwards, \"Clubhouse was incredible!\"\n\n'It's either dead by July or it's something big'\n\nIn Silicon Valley, where many of the world's top entrepreneurs boast about trying to solve some of the universe's most complex challenges, social media apps have served as both the butt of endless jokes and the source of absurd value creation. For almost two decades, start-ups have sought new and novel ways to help people connect with friends, peers, celebrities and strangers. Most have gone broke along the way, but the few successes \u2060\u2014 Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn (now part of Microsoft), Snap and Pinterest \u2060\u2014 generated billions of dollars for founders and early investors. It's the ultimate boom-or-bust business. Revenue comes mostly from advertisers, and success relies mostly on the so-called network effect: Every user brings in three new people, who each bring in three more. Either you're the category winner, like Facebook, or the failed also-ran like Friendster. In many instances, it all proves to be a passing fad, like Yik Yak, an anonymous messaging app for college students that collapsed after raising over $70 million. Or Yo, which allowed users to send the simple one-word message \"Yo\" and worked more as a parody than a useful tool. Or Chatroulette, an anonymous video chat app that was a brief pop-cultural phenomenon in 2010, then collapsed as users flooded it with unwanted nudity. Josh Felser, co-founder of venture firm Freestyle, expects Clubhouse to face the same sort of binary outcome. \"It's either dead by July or it's something big,\" said Felser, who estimates he spends about an hour a day on the app. \"We're all locked away right now so it was a good time to launch it. I don't know if it's sustainable.\" Much of the engagement on Clubhouse today comes when a celebrity joins a room and followers get notified. It could be MC Hammer, comedian Kevin Hart, actor Jared Leto (talking about washing fruit with soap) or hip-hop artist Fab 5 Freddy. Ben Horowitz, who has close personal ties to the hip-hop community, says his firm is targeting talent to bring onto the platform.\n\nActor Jared Leto enters the Heavenly Bodies: Fashion & The Catholic Imagination Costume Institute Gala at The Metropolitan Museum on May 07, 2018 in New York City. Ray Tamarra | GC Images | Getty Images\n\nChris Lyons, the head of Andreessen Horowitz's Cultural Leadership Fund, and Naithan Jones, a partner at the firm, \"have put more people in Clubhouse than anyone,\" Horowitz tweeted on Monday. An Andreessen Horowitz spokesperson declined to comment for this story, and Davison said he's not doing interviews yet. Matt Brezina, a San Francisco-based investor, joined Clubhouse in April after hearing about it from his friend Nate Bosshard, co-founder of fitness start-up Tonal. Brezina has become a fervent user, typically opening the app after getting notifications that someone he follows is in a room or created a room. He listens while cooking or laying in bed, and describes Clubhouse as the \"AirPods social network.\" \"I've used this app a lot to the point where my wife is like, 'You're on that app aren't you,'\" said Brezina, who's listened to chats about raising children while sheltered in place and Joe Biden's presidential campaign strategies. \"It's so simple, but it's such a powerful platform for people to have candid conversations.\" After reports of Clubhouse's financing round surfaced over the weekend, critics took to Twitter to ask if it's just the latest toy for tech bros. Del Johnson, a former Google and Oracle employee who now invests in start-ups, tweeted that he's been invited to Clubhouse three times but hasn't yet joined, citing his \"aversion to all exclusive clubs where the exclusion isn't based on anything tangible.\" Other detractors pointed to the absurdity of the valuation, while supporters argued that if it works, it will be worth many billions of dollars.\n\nCan it scale?", "author": ["Ari Levy Salvador Rodriguez", "Ari Levy", "Salvador Rodriguez"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/20/fed-minutes-released.html", "published": "2020-05-20T22:37:35", "title": "Fed minutes show fears of 'extraordinary amount of uncertainty and considerable risks' because of coronavirus", "text": "Federal Reserve officials called into action to rescue the economy from the clutches of the coronavirus worried about longer-lasting impacts from the pandemic including a second round of infections and the burden that low-income households would face, minutes released Wednesday from the central bank's April meeting showed.\n\nThe meeting, which ended April 29, concluded with the Federal Open Market Committee holding steady on interest rates and pondering future measures ahead.

Where it's appropriate, I will.\" But Nessel, in her letter to Trump, wrote that the mask requirement \"is not just the policy of Ford, by virtue of the Governor's Executive Orders.\" \"It is currently the law of this State.\" The White House had no comment about Nessel's letter, which referenced the fact that a personal valet at the White House who served Trump recently tested positive for Covid-19. The president has repeatedly tested negative for the virus. The letter said, \"Michigan has been hit especially hard by the virus, with more than 50,000 confirmed cases and 5,000 deaths.\" \"Anyone who has potentially been recently exposed, including the President of the United States, has not only a legal responsibility, but also a social and moral responsibility, to take reasonable precautions to prevent further spread of the virus,\" Nessel wrote.\n\nAttorney Dana Nessel, surrounded by her family, announces her bid for Michigan Attorney General in Braun Court Ann Arbor on Tuesday, Aug. 15, 2017.

As part of the plan, Amazon has pledged to meet the goals of the Paris climate agreement by 2040, a decade ahead of the Paris accord's goal. The company also expects 80% of Amazon's energy use to come from renewable sources by 2024, up from a current rate of 40%, before transitioning to zero emissions by 2030.\n\nEmily Cunningham, a former Amazon user experience designer and member of AECJ, characterized Amazon's work with oil and gas companies as lacking upside.

It is unclear whether the two will come to an agreement on price.\n\nThe talks come as the coronavirus pandemic has crushed Uber's ride-sharing business but grown demand for food delivery. Uber said earlier this month it will lay off 3,700 people, or about 14% of its 26,900 employees.\n\nThe spotlight from Klobuchar and other lawmakers is likely an unwelcome backdrop to deal discussions. Such scrutiny can result in CEOs testifying before Congress. Both companies have already drawn negative public attention on issues ranging from restaurant fee policy to worker treatment.\n\n\"As our country grapples with the many health and safety challenges brought about by the coronavirus (COVID-19) pandemic, many consumers have turned to food delivery apps to order meals online, and many restaurants have come to rely on the business they get through these apps to stay afloat,\" wrote Klobuchar, D-Minn., along with fellow Democratic Sens. Patrick Leahy of Vermont, Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut and Cory Booker of New Jersey.\n\n\"A merger of Uber Eats and Grubhub would combine two of the three largest food delivery application providers and raise serious competition issues in many markets around the country,\" they said.\n\n\"We urge the Department of Justice and the Federal Trade Commission to closely monitor the negotiations of this potential transaction and to initiate an investigation if the parties reach an agreement to merge.\"\n\nThe senators said that it is \"particularly troubling that this merger is being contemplated during a pandemic, when consumer demand has increased and when restaurants are more desperate for revenue than ever.\" They said they \"have been hearing about the exorbitant fees\" that online delivery app companies have been charging to restaurants.\n\nRepresentatives for Uber, Grubhub, the DOJ and the FTC didn't immediately respond to a request for comment on the lawmakers' letter.\n\nKlobuchar, a former presidential candidate, has been mentioned as a potential running mate for apparent Democratic nominee Joe Biden.\n\nIn their letter, Klobuchar, Leahy and Blumenthal argue that Uber Eats, Grubhub, and Doordash account for 20%, 28%, and 42% of online app-based food delivery sales across the nation, respectively. Merging Uber Eats and Grubhub would create significant anticompetitive effects, particularly at the local level, the Democrats argue. In New York City, for example, they said Uber Eats and Grubhub would have a hold on 79% of the market.\n\n\"These market shares are staggering,\" they wrote, \"particularly in light of the leverage that these online delivery companies already wield over restaurants, delivery workers, and consumers, especially during this pandemic.\"\n\nThe senators are part of a broader chorus of lawmakers calling for tough antitrust scrutiny amid the pandemic, worried that the crisis will allow already powerful players to amass even more share, as small competition fall by the wayside.\n\nSen.

Some Republicans, including Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, have said that a lack of confidence is an insufficient explanation for firing the inspector general.\n\n\"Unlike others, I don't talk about personnel matters. I don't leak to y'all,\" Pompeo told reporters.\n\nLinick had opened an investigation into alleged wrongdoing by Pompeo, House Foreign Affairs Committee Chairman Eliot Engel, D-N.Y., said after the dismissal. A Democratic aide told NBC News that Linick's removal might have been in response to an investigation into Pompeo's \"misuse of a political appointee at the Department to perform personal tasks for himself and Mrs. Pompeo.\" Those tasks included walking his dog, picking up his dry cleaning and making dinner reservations, according to NBC.\n\nEngel and Menendez are demanding that all records related to Linick's firing be handed over to them by Friday. Pompeo did not respond Wednesday when a reporter asked if he would comply with that document request.\n\nHours before the briefing was set to begin, new reports raised additional questions from Pompeo's critics about his conduct at the government agency.\n\nNBC News reported Tuesday night that Pompeo and his wife, Susan Pompeo, had regularly held elaborate, federally funded dinners with influential figures who could boost his political ambitions.\n\nPompeo held about two dozen of those dinners since 2018, NBC reported.\n\nPompeo, in an interview with The Washington Post on Monday, denied that he fired Linick in retaliation for any reported probe into his conduct. He said he was not aware of the watchdog's investigations, so his recommendation could not have been an act of reprisal.\n\nBut on Wednesday, Pompeo did note that \"there's one exception.\"\n\n\"I was asked a series of questions in writing, I responded to those questions with respect to a particular investigation,\" Pompeo said, adding that he submitted those responses earlier this year, to the best of his memory.\n\nPompeo said he did not know the scope or the nature of that investigation. \"I did what was right. I don't know if that investigation is continuing, I don't know if that investigation has been closed out. I don't have any sense of that. Again, it's not possible for there to have been retaliation.\"\n\nPelosi said Sunday that Linick's sudden firing could be \"unlawful\" if it was done in retaliation.\n\nNBC and other outlets reported Monday that Linick was also nearly done with another probe, this one dealing with Pompeo's approval of a multibillion-dollar arms sale to Saudi Arabia.\n\nLinick's office \"was investigating \u2014 at my request \u2014 Trump's phony declaration of an emergency so he could send weapons to Saudi Arabia,\" Engel said in a statement Monday. \"We don't have the full picture yet, but it's troubling that Secretary Pompeo wanted Mr. Linick pushed out before this work could be completed.\"\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on Wednesday morning reported that Pompeo had refused to sit for an interview about the Saudi arms deal with the IG's office.

Michael Nagle | Bloomberg | Getty Images\n\nDennis Lynch steers a mutual fund whose bets on Amazon and Zoom Video have helped it beat the market by more than 30% so far this year, but he isn't isn't ready to celebrate just yet. The Morgan Stanley Insight Fund was one of the top 10 large cap growth funds last decade, according to Morningstar, with an annualized return of 17.11%. That success has continued so far in 2020 in dramatic fashion, with the fund rising by more than a third year-to-date, according to Morningstar. Lynch described the fund's performance so far this year as \"relatively fortunate.\" It ended last December with large positions in what proved to be hot stocks during the downturn, but there could still be challenges ahead, Lynch said. \"Times like these are just so unpredictable \u2026 it's not over yet. Just because the market went down and went up doesn't mean there's a beginning and an end,\" Lynch said. \"In some way, when you're an investor, it's always a beginning. I think you need a long time to pass in order to judge whether or not you had a successful strategy or a successful period of decision marking.\"\n\n'It's not all one bet'\n\nLynch is the head of Counterpoint Global at Morgan Stanley Investment Management, which contains many funds. He said the Insight Fund serves as the \"sort of our best ideas\" product, and his team's goal is to \"collect what we think are highly unique companies.\" The fund, which has more than $3 billion in assets under management, is tech and software heavy, with Amazon and Slack holding the two biggest weights as of March 31, according to the fund's website. Lynch said his investment team has a few main areas of expertise, such as tech and health care, but that a main focus is on identifying upcoming trends. \"We think, in general, that markets are complex, adaptive systems. They're constantly evolving. It's partly our job to continue to adapt to try to figure out what other people are missing and identify big ideas before the rest of the world does,\" Lynch said. The portfolio had a 93% turnover rate during its most recent fiscal year, but Lynch said that stocks that are removed from Insight are often still held by the other funds he manages. The fund also has a 0.65% management fee, a minimum investment of $1,000 and measures itself against the Russell 3000 Growth Index. Though many of the biggest holdings are software names, Lynch said he believes the fund is well diversified within the sector. \"Within software, I think there can be different end markets, demands and exposures. It's not all one bet,\" Lynch said. One of those software bets is on the pharmaceutical industry, in the form of Veeva Systems. The software stock is up nearly 40% year-to-date and has been a long-time holding of the fund. \"At a larger level we see it as a hub for best practices and (customer relationship management) and drug development and data management for pharmaceutical companies,\" Lynch said. \"And once you can become the company that does that well it sort of can be kind of self-fulfilling, in part. When you have all the large pharmaceutical companies already on your platform, it enables you to learn from their experiences and improve your service to them constantly.\"\n\nInvesting in a crisis", "author": ["Jesse Pound"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/19/jamie-dimon-says-coronavirus-crisis-is-wake-up-call-for-a-more-inclusive-economy.html", "published": "2020-05-19T17:10:36", "title": "Jamie Dimon says coronavirus crisis is 'wake-up call' for a more inclusive economy", "text": "JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon said Tuesday in a memo that the coronavirus crisis should be used to build an economy that offers opportunities for \"dramatically more people.\"\n\nThe memo, issued ahead of his bank's annual shareholder meeting, served as an update to the New York-based lender's response to the pandemic.

In my annual letter to shareholders last month, we described the actions our firm is taking to support our employees, customers and communities. Things are changing quickly, so I wanted to update you on our recent efforts. I also want to share how we are thinking about and preparing for not only the safe re-opening of our economy, but also laying the foundation for an inclusive recovery that unlocks economic opportunity for more people.\n\nFrom the outset, our priority has been to continue to provide uninterrupted service to our clients and customers, while supporting and providing a safe work environment for our employees and helping those communities hit hard by the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nResponding to the needs of our customers and clients\n\nTo help customers who have told us they are struggling financially, we have made it easy to enroll in a payment assistance program. To date, we have provided assistance to over 1.5 million customer accounts, including delaying payments and refunding fees across our business banking, home lending, credit card, deposit and auto lease and loan accounts. And, we are quickly and prudently putting our capital and liquidity to work to help our clients \u2013 large and small \u2013 weather the crisis, pay their workers and bills, and provide the essential goods and services on which we all depend.\n\nIncluded in this, are hundreds of thousands of homeowners we've helped by delaying their mortgage payments for at least three months. They won't be charged a late fee or penalty during this time. We are also available to discuss extensions for many customers who need more time to recover, and upon request and if eligible, we can add the option to move missed payments to the end of their mortgage term.\n\nIn March and April, we approved more than $45 billion in new credit for our clients impacted by COVID-19. This included more than $6 billion to hospitals and healthcare companies, educational institutions, nonprofits and state and local governments. For example, we worked with NewYork-Presbyterian Health System \u2013 which has seen a significant increase in overnight patients as a result of COVID-19 \u2013 to increase their line of credit so they could acquire vital medical supplies and equipment and bring on additional staff.\n\nWe've also assisted our corporate clients in raising capital, including many in industries that have been hard hit by the pandemic, from healthcare to travel and transportation. Year to date, we've helped clients raise $664 billion in investment grade financing, and also provided $104 billion of high yield financing.\n\nAdditionally, during the first 60 days of the crisis, we extended $950 million in new loans for our small business clients, such as Kids Klub Child Development Centers, which offer preschool, daycare and after school programming. The Los Angeles-based company was in the middle of constructing a new location in Seattle when the crisis hit. We worked with them to accelerate access to critically needed funds to finish construction and continue paying their 200 employees while they closed down and revamped their centers to provide care for children of essential workers. We've also worked to help as many of our customers as possible receive loans through the SBA's Paycheck Protection Program (PPP). For example, we helped the Jupiter Hotel in Portland, Oregon maintain its workforce as they converted 81 rooms into a shelter for homeless individuals with underlying health conditions or respiratory symptoms but who have not tested positive for COVID-19. We also helped the South Florida Cancer Association keep drivers on their payroll who transport underprivileged people to their radiation and chemotherapy treatments.\n\nSince the beginning of PPP, we funded a total of more than $30 billion to over 250,000 businesses, helping to support more than 3 million employees. The average loan amount was roughly $122,000 and half of those loans went to companies with fewer than 5 employees.\n\nHelping the most vulnerable in our communities\n\nWe are using data-driven solutions to help some of the hardest hit communities get through the pandemic \u2013 and to help them recover when it's over. So far, this includes a $250 million global business and philanthropic commitment to support vulnerable and underrepresented communities, existing nonprofit partners and underserved small businesses.\n\nWe know that many small businesses are at risk of being locked out of the resources they desperately need to stay afloat \u2013 that's why $200 million of our commitment is to help underserved small businesses and nonprofits access low-cost capital through community partners. For example, this includes $50 million to Grow America Fund, a Community Development Financial Institution, so they can help small businesses in underserved communities cover expenses such as rent and employee salaries.\n\nWe are also providing $50 million in philanthropic support to nonprofits working to help communities and people hit hardest by this public health crisis. For example, we provided support to enable the Healthcare Advancement Program (H-CAP) to implement new training programs focused on crisis care and infectious disease preparedness. Our firm has partnered with H-CAP over the last several years to train workers for jobs in the healthcare sector, and now these new training programs will prepare workers in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Philadelphia and other cities across the U.S. to fill the shortage of clinical care professionals needed to address the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nAnd we're also finding other ways we can help in our communities. For example, we are collaborating with Marriott and others to provide up to $10 million worth of hotel stays for healthcare professionals fighting COVID-19 in the United States. The initiative is providing free rooms to first responders in locations such as New York City, New Orleans, Chicago and Detroit.\n\nSupporting our employees as we move toward re-opening our economy\n\nOur employees' safety and wellbeing is a top priority, and we've taken extensive steps to support them during the crisis, including extra time off for all and expanding access to medical resources, internally and externally. As we continue to address the immediate health and humanitarian impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic, the public and private sectors are developing longer-term plans to re-open our economy. Protecting people's safety is important, which is why we must look to public health officials to guide the timing and sequencing for lifting restrictions. Securing the proper amount of equipment, testing and monitoring, hospital capacity and other tools and processes in place will be essential in giving people confidence they can safely return to work, school and other public spaces.\n\nAs we develop our strategy for returning more employees to working on-site, the two principal considerations driving our approach are using the latest data and information to do it at the right time \u2013 which may differ by region, state and country \u2013 and prioritizing the health and safety of our employees. We are working to identify what changes may be needed to achieve this objective, including reviewing our current office configurations and protocols. We are also coordinating with and seeking guidance from government entities and health authorities.\n\nRebuilding a more inclusive economy\n\nIn the midst of today's uncertainties and the acute impacts \u2013 with unemployment high and little economic activity \u2013 it's hard to plan for the future. Yet to lay the foundation for the kind of recovery we need, it is critical we do so. It is my fervent hope that we use this crisis as a catalyst to rebuild an economy that creates and sustains opportunity for dramatically more people, especially those who have been left behind for too long. The last few months have laid bare the reality that, even before the pandemic hit, far too many people were living on the edge. Unfortunately, low-income communities and people of color are being hit the hardest, exacerbating the health and economic inequities that were already unacceptably pronounced before the virus took over.\n\nAn inclusive economy \u2013 in which there is widespread access to opportunity \u2013 is a stronger, more resilient economy. This crisis must serve as a wake-up call and a call to action for business and government to think, act and invest for the common good and confront the structural obstacles that have inhibited inclusive economic growth for years. From the re-opening of small businesses to the rehiring of workers, let's leverage this moment to think creatively about how we can mobilize to address so many issues that inhibit the creation of an inclusive economy and fray our social fabric. We look forward to sharing more ideas soon for how to do this. By doing the right thing during times of crisis, we can emerge stronger and more cohesive in its wake.\n\nFinally, we are proud that our firm has been well equipped to quickly step up and provide significant resources and support because we entered this crisis in a position of strength. This is a direct result of the actions and investments we've made over many years to build a strong, resilient company. We believe it's our responsibility to be there for the people who rely on us in times like this. This is precisely why we work so hard to be that kind of company.\n\nJamie Dimon\n\nChairman and Chief Executive Officer\n\nJPMorgan Chase & Co.", "author": ["Hugh Son"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/19/china-techs-alibaba-xiaomi-to-benefit-as-hong-kong-changes-hang-seng-rules.html", "published": "2020-05-19T07:28:01", "title": "From Alibaba to Xiaomi, China tech giants set to benefit as Hong Kong changes stock index rules", "text": "Logo and mascot 'Ali cattle' at the headquarters of Alibaba Group in Hangzhou.\n\nMajor changes on Hong Kong's benchmark Hang Seng index could pave the way for China's tech giants to expand their trading presence in Asia, while giving more investors access to their stocks.\n\nIn a major revamp announced on Monday, the Hang Seng index will for the first time allow companies with primary listings elsewhere, as well as those with dual-class shares, to be included in the 50-year-old benchmark.\n\nCompanies listed in the U.S. can have a secondary listing on the Hong Kong Stock Exchange currently.

When that happens, he says, investors will be better off owning growth stocks, for instance, that can at least somewhat protect against the expected surge in inflation.\n\nIt sounds an awful lot like he is advocating that we pile into the very same stocks that massively outperformed 1) throughout the longest bull market in history from March 2009, through early this year; 2) during this year's Covid-19 sell-off (S&P 500 fell 34% from peak to trough); and 3) during the rebound from that sell-off (+26% from the low).\n\nTo me, he doesn't really sound like he is advocating a strategy of \"buy low.\" And in stark contrast to another legend by the name of Warren Buffett, whose company is currently carrying well in excess of $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet, I.M. seems to be largely ignoring the significant risks associated with this severe recession as well as the lofty valuations associated with said \"growth stocks.\"\n\nNow, you may have also heard other professional money managers talk about the risk of a deflationary spiral. They may have said that notwithstanding the massive job losses and business shutdowns, Covid-19 is likely to have a far bigger impact on aggregate demand than aggregate supply. In other words, the economy will be running at significant excess capacity (i.e., the economy is producing more than it can sell). And as we all know from Econ 101, if demand falls faster than supply then prices will not rise, as Mr. Sureofmyself suggests, they will fall.\n\nThat great minds can so disagree is unsettling. Who is right? Either of these outcomes seems plausible. And it's possible we could have deflationary pressures in the near- to intermediate term, followed by inflationary pressures thereafter. The point is that the path of our economic evolution is not preordained and is difficult to predict with much precision. As such, it is tempting but perilous to embrace a path with such conviction at a time when the future is inherently unknowable. Economists John Kay and Mervyn King describe this in their eponymous new book, \"Radical Uncertainty.\" Author Brene Brown suggests that vulnerability is an uncomfortable, unwelcome constant and should be recognized and incorporated into healthy psyches.\n\n\n\nHonest investors need to invest for a future that may have any number of outcomes. Investing weighs risk and reward and is a constantly evolving process. Designing portfolios for a prescribed path is straightforward; for example if interest rates are headed higher, sell dividend payers and bonds. If they are headed lower, buy them. But designing portfolios for any number of inherently unknowable outcomes is not straightforward. It requires a flexible process that can change based on changes in the investment backdrop. By definition, it will almost certainly be imperfect (unless you get crazy lucky). My goal as the steward for many families and institutions is an investment allocation that will endure market struggles, enjoy market gains and should produce solid, long-term results.\n\nStrong balance sheets with limited debt, lots of cash, low dependence on the capital markets, good cash flow and the ability to operate and earn are the core of my pandemic portfolio.\n\nBecause investors must also be opportunistic, I also seek stocks that are selling at significant discounts to intrinsic value because of an unfairly perceived vulnerability. Because I'm conservative and risk-averse, the airlines and hospitality sectors, for example, are outside of my comfort zone right now. There are investors that will place wagers on which airlines will survive, and some will have stellar returns. Yet there are others that will lose bitterly as businesses fail to continue as going concerns. We do not venture into the thin branches of risk. Will there come a time when there is more clarity in the airline and hospitality sectors and an investment opportunity arises that meets our criteria? Perhaps, but we are far too early in this crisis to make that sort of determination.\n\nRecognizing and accepting the \"radical uncertainty\" of the unknown is much harder than following a specific prescription or dogma. But it is often the only honest response.\n\nUnderstanding that outcomes are unknowable helps set reasonable expectations and avoids surprised, panicked disappointment. Keep your wits. Have a plan. Know that we are all vulnerable, but history argues that the long-term expansion in the U.S. economy drives stock prices higher. Longer periods mitigate and buffer short-term volatility. Invest with a disciplined, dispassionate plan and have confidence that the republic and U.S. economy will survive and thrive again.\n\nMichael Farr is the founder, president, and CEO of Farr, Miller & Washington Investment Counsel.", "author": ["Michael K.

Google Earth\n\nThe largest public companies that tapped the government's emergency relief fund for small businesses nearly all had ready access to other forms of capital, according to a CNBC analysis of filings. Even amid the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic, these companies raised millions of dollars by selling stock or had idle credit lines they could've used, factors that likely should've prompted them to return loans they got from the federal Paycheck Protection Program. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned of \"severe consequences\" for companies that shouldn't have participated in the program. But just hours before a May 14 deadline to return PPP loans with amnesty, most public companies made no mention of giving back the funds, which become grants if used for approved expenses like payroll. Of the $1.32 billion tapped by public companies across 407 loans, only 61 loans making up a combined $411 million are being returned, according to data analytics firm FactSquared.\n\nOne example: Cutera, a California-based maker of devices like laser-powered hair removers, raised more than $26 million last month by selling shares on the open market, according to filings. It had also applied for a PPP loan days before the Treasury Department had explicitly discouraged public companies with access to the capital markets from doing so. Cutera received the money from stock sales on April 21, the very same day that its application for a $7.1 million PPP loan came through. On top of that, the company had $19.5 million in cash and liquid investments as of March 30, and an untouched $25 million credit line from Wells Fargo to fund its operations. Cutera, run in part by San Francisco-based hedge fund manager Daniel Plants, is just one example of dozens of PPP applicants found by CNBC that were large and established enough to have relationships with bankers and sophisticated investors.\n\nAfter the initial $350 billion round of the small business relief fund was quickly disbursed, a backlash grew against companies including Shake Shack and Ruth's Hospitality Group that had tapped the fund despite having other options. Those two companies returned the money, and were eventually followed by other firms with well-known consumer brands like AutoNation. But many public companies have so far escaped scrutiny because they aren't household names. CNBC found 49 companies with a market capitalization of at least $100 million that took PPP loans and hadn't disclosed plans to return the money as of May 12. Of those firms, 13 sold shares this year, and many of the rest had unused credit lines good for tens of millions of dollars in borrowing power, according to filings. Last month, the Small Business Administration issued guidance in response to the public uproar over the loans, saying that it was unlikely that a \"a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets\" could make a good-faith certification that it needed the PPP funds. The agency gave companies two weeks to return the money if they suspected they may no longer qualify, and later extended the deadline to May 14. On May 13, Treasury issued an updated FAQ saying that PPP loans under $2 million would likely not be examined and that the deadline to return funds was moved yet again to May 18. \"The purpose of this program was not social welfare for big business,\" Mnuchin told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on April 28, adding that the government would audit PPP loans over $2 million to make sure they were valid. \"The purpose of this program was to help small businesses.\" Many of the companies found by CNBC are in the technology, health tech and pharmaceutical sectors, which are often the types of businesses that need to regularly sell stock to fund operations while developing new products.\n\nOne example is OncoCyte, which develops early detection cancer tests. The California-based company secured a $1.14 million PPP loan through Silicon Valley Bank on April 23. The next day, it filed a prospectus to issue shares, and ultimately raised $10.75 million last month from stock sales. Another is Xeris Pharmaceuticals, a maker of diabetes medication, which reaped $39.9 million from share sales in February. The Chicago-based company got $5.1 million from the PPP on April 22, and later decided to return $900,000 of that, keeping the rest for payroll and other expenses, the firm said. Applied Optoelectronics, a Texas-based maker of fiber-optic networking products, is another company that has ready access to capital markets. The company had $28.8 million in unused borrowing lines and $62.5 million in cash and liquid securities as of March 31, as well as a deal with Raymond James to sell $55 million in shares. Despite its solid financial footing, the firm applied for a $6.2 million PPP loan through Truist Bank, which it got April 17. In a May filing, the company said that despite the latest SBA guidelines, it still believed it met \"all the requirements\" for the program but that the loan could subject it to \"additional scrutiny which could adversely affect our financial condition.\"\n\nSteven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury secretary, center, walks through the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Sunday, March 22, 2020.

A spike in new accounts at online brokers show that young and inexperienced investors saw the coronavirus downturn as an entry point into the world of investing and not a time to hunker down. \"New investors who sense a generational-buying moment but do not have much background in the equity space,\" Citi chief U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich said in a note to clients. \"We have heard anecdotally about younger individuals with less market experience viewing the March plunge as a unique time to start portfolios and often crowding into the tech arena, purchasing the stocks whose services or products they know and use.\" The major online brokers \u2014 Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Etrade and Robinhood \u2014 saw new accounts grow as much as 170% in the first quarter, when stocks experienced the fastest bear market and the worst first quarter in history. But young people apparently saw it as an opportunity and began buying familiar technology stocks.\n\nIn March, stocks started to rebound led by resilient tech stocks. There were also hopes that slowly reopening the economy and a Covid-19 treatment will create a path to recovery.\n\n'Monumental volumes'\n\nThe major online brokers saw a major jump in new users during the coronavirus sell-off, bolstered by zero commissions and fractional trades. Charles Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in an earnings release the broker saw \"monumental volumes\" of trading from the 609,000 new broker accounts added in the first quarter, with over 280,000 in March alone. The quarter included 27 of the 30 highest volume days in Schwab's history.\n\nTD Ameritrade \u2014 which is set to be acquired by Schwab \u2014 said last month that retail clients opened a record 608,000 new funded accounts in the first quarter, with more than two-thirds of those opened in March. The e-broker's new accounts proved to \"skew younger\" over the last quarter,\" TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan told CNBC. \"Perhaps because they're home or perhaps because of furloughs, they also have time to dedicate to their investments that they didn't necessarily have before,\" Kinahan added. ETrade, which is set to be acquired by Morgan Stanley, saw a gain of 363,000 accounts in the quarter, a company record. \"I think a lot of the innovation around trading commissions has really driven the accessibility of the markets for everyone and clearly that cohort, the younger ones, are seeing it for the first time in the headlines everyday, 'massive market drop,' so the combination of current events, innovation of trading and technology have really driven this whole movement,\" Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC.\n\nRobinhood users soar\n\nRobinhood \u2014 millennial favored stock trading app \u2014 saw a mind-blowing 3 million new accounts in the first quarter, despite glitches and crashes on heavy trading volume days. \"The access to trading, there are no barriers to entry anymore, its on your phone, you can buy whatever you want, fractional shares are available so if you can't pony up $1,400 to buy one shares of Google you can still own the FANG stocks,\" Welsh added.\n\nStock positions at the Silicon Valley start-up have nearly tripled since the end of last year. With the major inflow of new market participants, the market chugged higher, led by the companies young people know and love.\n\nNarrow, tech-led rally\n\nAll three major averages have joined the marker comeback, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is in the green for the year. The technology darlings that have carried the market over much of the last decade \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet \u2014 are leading stocks out of the coronavirus trenches. Shares of Netflix are up 36% and Amazon is up 30% this year.\n\nWall Street is skeptical if this rebound is the real start to the next bull market, given its narrowness. Some analysts are confident stocks will retest their lows when the full economic picture is realized. TD Ameritrade investors \"have been doing a pretty good job choosing technology stocks,\" said Kinahan. \"In this last month, Apple was one of the stocks that stood out in terms of millennial clients compared to our overall client base and Apple performed pretty well in that time frame.\" \"You saw Microsoft, some of the banks, Disney, as the big ones in that time frame. These companies that tend to sit on cash, said Kinahan. TD Ameritrade clients also picked some beaten down oil stocks. Investor newbies are also piling into the beaten down airlines and cruise lines, according to Robintracker, which tracks Robinhood account activity but is not affiliated with the company. Market participants have increased positions in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Air lines, Carnival Cruises and Norwegian Cruise lines the most of any stocks in the past month. \"In the height in March of things that were going very poorly, our millennial clients led the way buying Carnival cruise lines and at the time people are like 'oh my God, how can they do that?'

Relativity Space\n\nRelativity Space passed a key milestone toward its goal of launching a rocket that is almost entirely 3D-printed. The Los Angeles-based space start-up conducted a series of tests in December using a 3D-printed tank, which the company increasingly pressurized until it burst. \"It's a pretty big deal to show that the materials actually work and the manufacturing process actually works,\" Relativity CEO Tim Ellis told CNBC on Monday. Ellis explained that \"the point is to figure out what pressure the vessel actually holds.\" While the tank was a fifth the size of the one that will be used for Relativity's Terran 1 rocket, it was structurally representative of the pressures and stress that it would undergo during a launch.\n\nRelativity co-founder and CTO Jordan Noone stands next to one of the company's Stargate 3D printers. Relativity\n\nThe burst pressurization tests helped the company verify its ambitious 3D-printing approach to building rockets, as well as the materials it's using. Ellis said the tank burst at about \"10% more than the requirements with the safety factor\" needed for a launch. \"It's definitely sufficient for the whole launch vehicle,\" Ellis said, adding that \"we've got two years to keep making it better.\"\n\nRelativity growing despite coronavirus crisis\n\nRelativity's rocket development is still on track for its first launch in 2021, Ellis noted, despite the coronavirus pandemic that's begun causing delays within the space industry. While the company's rocket engine test program has been \"delayed the most,\" due to NASA's Stennis center largely shutting down, Ellis said that overall Relativity has been able to continue moving forward. That's in large part because of Relativity's unique approach to manufacturing. \"There's just fewer processes and way fewer supply chain steps, because almost everything is made from very limited raw materials, like our whole rocket structure. All of the engine and the other auxiliary structure components are made from just two raw materials, so it's a very simple supply chain,\" Ellis said. Additionally, Ellis said Relativity is \"in a really good cash position\" to weather the crisis, given that it raised $140 million in October. Relativity's investors include Social Capital, Playground Global, Y Combinator, Bond Capital, Jared Leto and Mark Cuban. \"We are not planning any layoffs and are actually accelerating our hiring,\" Ellis said. \"We've actually done well over a dozen either new hires or on boarding people remotely via Zoom during this time.\" His company began telling the majority of its workforce of more than 150 employees to stay home the first week of March. But the company has been able to keep development moving forward, as Ellis said Relativity has had all four its \"Stargate\" printers running during this time. \"We have one person per building operating printers right now,\" Ellis said. Relativity in February secured a new headquarters in Long Beach, California, which Ellis said most of the company will be moved into by the end of July, with \"the whole facility operational by the end of this year.\"\n\nRelativity co-founder and CEO Tim Ellis stands next to a 3D printed part of the company's Terran 1 rocket, with two of the Stargate printers visible in the foreground.

This seems paradoxical given the economic toll \u2014 to say nothing of the emotional toll \u2014 on millions of people across the country without a job. While some say this is further indication that the stock market has become decoupled from reality, others say there are clear reasons why stocks have rebounded, and can continue to move higher. For one, the jobs data in and of itself is backward-looking. The April figures \u2014 which saw a record 20.5 million Americans lose their job \u2014 is from the height of the crisis. Since then, economies have begun to reopen. There is still a long way to go, of course, but the market is discounting what's going to happen six months from now, when most states will be getting back to business.\n\nStrategists also point out that the losses have been somewhat concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sector, whose underperformance has overshadowed strength in other areas of the market. And with the government and federal reserve providing record stimulus measures, some argue that once businesses do get back up and running, the recovery will be swift.\n\nThe S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all opened higher on Friday, with the Dow surging more than 300 points. Since the March 23 low, all three averages have bounced more than 30%.\n\nWorst over?\n\nWhile the debate among health experts about how and when economies should reopen is ongoing, some states have already started easing shelter-in-place measures. A number of states including Florida began phase one reopenings on Monday. California became the latest state to lift some of its precautionary measures, with certain low-risk retailers allowed to open beginning Friday. \"The market knows that the job losses are self-inflicted due to the widespread shutdowns,\" Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar told CNBC. \"Thus, now that we are beginning the reopening process the market assumes many of these people will hopefully get hired back over the coming months and quarters.\"\n\nAdditionally, 78% of those who lost their job in April said they were furloughed, meaning the unemployment in theory will be temporary. Goldman strategist Jan Hatzius said this is an important distinction to make, given that it suggests the recovery will be swifter. \"If job losses are concentrated in this segment [furlough], it would increase the scope for a more rapid labor market recovery when the economy eventually rebounds (because employees can be recalled to their previous jobs, as in several past recessions),\" he wrote in a note to clients ahead of the report.\n\nPockets of strength?\n\nAt first the market sell-off was broad in nature as the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus sent the major averages tumbling into a bear market at the fastest pace on record. But since then, the divide between the winners and losers widened. Unsurprisingly stocks most exposed to the coronavirus threat \u2014 including hotels and airlines \u2014 have continued to trade lower. But other names are showing strength. On Thursday the Nasdaq went positive for the year, as names like Netflix and Amazon surged to all-time highs. \"Large companies have fallen much less than smaller companies. It is likely that as a result of this crisis the strong will get stronger ... and so the stock market is reflecting that in its relative valuation,\" Peter Orszag, Financial Advisory CEO at Lazard and former OMB director under Obama, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"The US consumer has proven to be the economic engine over the last decade, and investors who are buying heavily into this market believe that behavioral changes are unlikely to create a dislocation in demand longer than a couple of quarters,\" added Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth. That said, Saccocia said a more cautious tone is warranted, since she believes it's a \"misconception\" that demand for consumer services will return quickly once government edicts lift.\n\nOngoing stimulus?\n\nAs the coronavirus wreaked havoc on markets, governments and central banks around the world stepped in in an effort to prop up prices. In March, President Donald Trump signed into law a record $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act, while the Federal Reserve announced that it would engage in unlimited asset purchases. \"While the collapse in economic activity is historic, so too is the global policy response to cushion the impact and support a recovery as containment measures are relaxed,\" JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a recent note to clients. \"We estimate the impact of Fed easing in both rates and credit more than compensate for the temporary hit to corporate earnings when valuing the US market via discounted earnings,\" he added.\n\nZero rates?\n\nAs part of its stimulus measures, the Federal Reserve in March slashed interest rates to near zero. At the central bank's most recent meeting at the end of April, it pledged to keep rates at historic lows until the economy recovers. This supports economic activity since it makes borrowing money cheaper. \"Interest rates are going to be extremely low -- barely positive -- for a very long period of time, so that does provide some support to equity prices,\" noted Orszag.\n\nLooking forward", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/bitcoin-btc-cryptocurrency-prices-rise-as-halving-approaches.html", "published": "2020-05-08T06:45:03", "title": "Cryptocurrency market jumps by over $13 billion driven by bitcoin as major technical event approaches", "text": "Mehmet Ali Ozcan | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nA rally in bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report an increased interest from institutional investors. Bitcoin crossed $10,000 on Friday morning Singapore time, the first time it has hit that price since February, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency had pared some of those gains and was trading around $9,900.75 as of 1:39 p.m. Singapore time, still representing a more than 6.4% rise from the day before. The entire market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market had jumped by more than $13 billion from the day before, as of around 1:39 p.m. Singapore time. That move had been largely driven by bitcoin which makes up most of that figure. The value of the entire market stood at $268.07 billion.\n\nIndustry participants said that a number of factors \u2014 from supportive central bank monetary policy to increased interest from institutional investors \u2014 has factored into the bitcoin rally. Bitcoin suffered two bouts of intense selling in March sending it to a low of around $3,867, a price not seen since March 2019. Since then, the price has rallied over 150%. Meanwhile, stock markets, which also saw sharp drops in March, have recovered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March low. \"Overall markets have been bullish since the March lows and this is across asset classes, including crypto,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Money printing by the Fed and other central banks globally have given a lot of confidence to investors that the economy will be supported no matter what.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe 'halving'\n\nPart of the rise in bitcoin's price since the March low has been anticipation of a technical event known as \"halving.\" Bitcoin is not issued by a centralized authority like fiat currencies are. That is why it is often called a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency. Instead it is governed by code and is underpinned by a technology known as blockchain. In the world of bitcoin, so-called miners with specialized high-powered computers compete with each other to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever \"wins\" this race gets rewarded in newly minted bitcoin. This \"mining\" activity happens in blocks, which is essentially a group of transactions joined into one. Currently, these miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per block mined. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. On May 12, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoin. The effect is that the supply of bitcoin coming onto the market is reduced. Previous halving events, which happen every four years, have preceded big price increases in bitcoin.\n\n\"For the past few weeks, we have seen additional players enter the BTC market as prices have trended upward in anticipation of the halving event as bulls saw this as an opportunity to buy BTC ahead of a price pop and what many expect will be significant price appreciation,\" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a bitcoin index fund provider, told CNBC. BTC refers to bitcoin's currency code like USD for the U.S. dollar. \"This has undoubtedly continued into this week and may even carry over the weekend as the halving draws closer.\"\n\nInstitutional buying?\n\nDibb said there are other factors at play as well, including more institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, a high-profile Wall Street hedge fund manager, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. \"The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin\u2014publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC's sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone,\" Dibb said. \"With monetary easing policies and 'unlimited' economic stimuli being recently unveiled across the world, fiat currencies seem set to weaken substantially. This has, in turn, led to bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' to gain added traction amongst investors who are seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets.\" Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a so-called safe haven asset during turbulent times for other risky assets like stock markets. However, recently, bitcoin has fallen and risen when stock markets have.\n\nFlashbacks to 2017?", "author": ["Arjun Kharpal"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/bubble-stocks-like-beyond-meat-and-peloton-were-supposed-to-blow-up-but-the-opposite-happened.html", "published": "2020-05-08T12:37:07", "title": "'Bubble' stocks like Beyond Meat and Peloton were supposed to blow up, but the opposite happened", "text": "Peloton machine Source: Peloton\n\nMany on Wall Street were convinced the usual playbook would occur when this market and economic downturn hit.

Investors flocked to their old loves Netflix and Amazon in the stay-at-home age, while cheering positive news from smaller players like Beyond Meat and Peloton. Beyond Meat reported that sales more than doubled in the first quarter thanks to newfound demand from its partners and retailers looking to bulk up on alternative meats in an age when meatpacking plants are shutting down because of the virus risk. Peloton said it held its largest class ever last week, with more than 23,000 people streaming it from home. The shares surged on Thursday after it said sales were up 66%. That is not to say these stocks didn't suffer from the market's historic rout at first as investors dusted off the old playbook. In fact, Beyond Meat, Tesla and Peloton all fell more severely than the S&P 500 during the rapid plunge. \"Several of these stocks did get hit hard initially,\" said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \"It was only after the worst was over that people came running back into those names.\" \"Once investors saw that the Fed was going to provide a strong safety net, they came back into the market, but they still wanted to weight their holdings towards those that would actually benefit from the lockdown,\" Maley said.\n\n'Cult of personality'\n\nTesla is a different story.

Jeena Moon | Reuters\n\nWith one-third of S&P 500 companies declining to provide guidance, picking winners and losers has become a delicate business. How can anyone possibly figure out what's going to happen to earnings when the companies themselves have admitted they don't know? Regardless, one of the defining characteristics of stock investors is that ignorance of the future has never stopped them from making bets \u2014 big bets, in some cases. The last few weeks have seen many unusual flows into exchange-traded funds that offer an insight into what those bets look like. Here are some broader themes:\n\nIs this the bottom?\n\nHow many times have you heard this story? Despite the worst possible outlook, some investors are trying to call bottoms in beaten-up industries like energy and airlines Shares outstanding in the S&P 500 Energy ETF, for example, have increased 45% since the beginning of April. It's even wilder for U.S. Global JETS ETF, a basket of mostly American airlines. Shares outstanding have gone from 1.5 million at the end of March to north of 40 million shares.\n\nThe winners will keep winning\n\nGold diggers\n\nA smaller but equally enthusiastic groupis continuing to pour money into gold ETFs. Call them the doom-and-gloomers: those who believe gold is a haven in uncertain times. Investment demand for gold is way up even as jewelry demand in China and India, the two largest jewelry markets in the world, is down. Shares outstanding in the largest ETF that holds gold directly, SPDR Gold Trust, are at their highest level since 2013, even as gold prices also hit a seven-year high, swelling the value of the fund to over $50 billion. Shares in competitor iShares Gold Trust have also skyrocketed.\n\nInto the US, out of everywhere else\n\nAnother noticeable trend: into America, out of Europe and Asia. There have been outflows in the largest European ETFs, including Vanguard FTSE Europe, SPDR EuroSTOXX 50, iShares MSCI Eurozone and iShares Core MSCI EAFE. The picture in emerging markets is a bit more nuanced, but in general there have been outflows from the larger funds as well, including Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, said it was no surprise investors were reducing exposure to areas with significant China influence. \"With expectations that China and other historically fast growing markets experiencing the same pain as the US, investors have chosen to reduce their risk profile,\" he wrote to me.\n\nWhat's it all mean?", "author": ["Bob Pisani"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/this-breakdown-of-retail-sales-data-shows-why-amazon-is-leading-the-stock-market.html", "published": "2020-05-15T20:12:19", "title": "This breakdown of retail sales data shows why Amazon is leading the stock market", "text": "\"In typical Internet fashion, a winner-take-most model played out with Amazon now accounting for 40% of US [gross merchandise volume],\" Bernstein analysts said Friday in a note to clients. Benstein pointed to Amazon's large production selection, lower prices, and reliable delivery as factors that will make it a \"clear beneficiary of eCommerce acceleration.\"\n\nOther retailers are also seeing a bounce in online orders, but Amazon's market share, as well as the one-stop-shop nature of the site, means it's often the first choice for consumers.\n\nIncluded in this category, which saw an 8.4% month-over-month increase, is online shopping. With much of the country under shelter-in-place orders during April, consumers increasingly turned towards e-commerce giants like Amazon for their shopping needs.\n\nAs the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March, shares of the Seattle-based company initially moved lower, but since then the stock has recovered \u2014 and then some. Amazon hit an all-time intraday high of $2,475 on April 30, and shares have gained nearly 30% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 11.7% decline.\n\nIn the first quarter, Amazon said that net sales jumped 26% year over year to $75.5 billion as people flocked to its site. The volume was so high that the company temporarily halted delivery for non-essential items while hiring 175,000 additional workers to keep up with the heightened demand.\n\n\"Amazon loyalists leaned so heavily into this channel that they broke it \u2013 with the company pivoting away from non-essential deliveries and hiring 175K more workers to keep up. Walmart and Target loyalists did the same thing to those retailers' nascent digital channels,\" Bernstein added.\n\nAmazon is not the only retailer seeing a spike in online sales. On April 23 Target said digital sales were up 275% month-to-date, while Best Buy said in an April business update that domestic online sales jumped 250%. Wayfair, Shopify and Overstock.com are among the other online retails that have reported rising sales.\n\nLooking to capitalize on the digital sales surge, Walmart announced on April 30 that it was rolling out its Express Delivery service. The company accelerated the development of the service in an effort to meet growing demand for delivery, while also announcing plans to hire an additional 200,000 people.\n\nWhile all of these companies have seen a jump in sales, their market share of the digital shopping sphere lags Amazon by a significant amount. Amazon makes up roughly 40% of the market while Walmart, the second largest player, occupies around 5% of the market, according to eMarketer.\n\nShares of Walmart are up about 4% for the year while Target has slid 5%. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), which tracks the sector, has dropped more than 20%.\n\nAmazon expects the jump in sales during the pandemic to lead to longer-term gains. For the second quarter, the company said it expects net sales to come in between $75 billion and $81 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 18% and 28%.\n\n\"We believe that the long term steepening of Amazon's growth curve driven by the acceleration of consumer adoption of ecommerce and enterprise adoption in cloud computing, enabled by the company's investments in fulfillment and infrastructure, and the associated high returns are likely to drive significant share price outperformance well beyond the current crisis,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said following the company's first quarter results.", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/jim-cramer-plant-based-meat-is-a-trend-investors-should-not-ignore.html", "published": "2020-05-06T16:35:17", "title": "Cramer says the plant-based meat 'movement is happening' and investors better 'get on the bus'", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday that investors cannot ignore the rising popularity of plant-based meat products.\n\n\"This movement is happening.

It doesn't begin with a billion dollars. This is not blockbuster drug, but watch this trend,\" Cramer said. \"I think it's very exciting for investors.\"\n\nShares of Beyond Meat were up about 17% on Wednesday morning to around $118 each.\n\nBeyond Meat, at a $7.2 billion market value, has been at times one of Wall Street's hottest stocks but also one of the most volatile since its May 2019 initial public offering. Priced at $25 per share, the stock saw a meteoric rise to nearly $240 by last July. But come December, it had lost about 70% of its value. In the early part of this year, the stock rebounded before falling off a cliff, bottoming at about $48 in mid-March. Since then, the stock has more than doubled.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, in addition to strong revenue, Beyond Meat posted quarterly net income of $1.8 million, up from a net loss of more than $6 million last year. It did warn of a hit to its restaurant business due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, the \"Mad Money\" host said he believes the plant-based meat industry may ultimately be beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nMeatpacking plants across the U.S. have seen significant virus outbreaks, forcing some to slow down production or temporarily close as workers became sick. The developments ignited concerns about the country's food supply, although President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week requiring the plants to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I think there are people who are getting appalled by what's happened at the meat packers. ... I think these stories make you become not necessarily vegetarian but to think twice about beef,\" Cramer said. \"If you think twice about beef and then you try to Beyond, you kind of realize it's very, very similar.\"\n\nWhile plant-based meat options have typically been more expensive than traditional meat, Cramer said the rising costs of beef, in particular, due to the coronavirus represents an opportunity for alternative producers.\n\nOne of Beyond Meat's chief rivals in the plant-based meat category, Impossible Foods, is not publicly traded. But it is widely available as well. Grocery store chain Kroger also has launched private-label beef options.\n\nCramer noted that food giant such as Nestle have entered the plant-based burger market.

While it is hoped that the presence of antibodies reduces or removes the risk of reinfection, this has not yet been proved. The length of any immunity gained is also unknown.\n\nDr Claudia Paoloni, president of the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, said: \u201cThe ability to assess who has and has not already had this virus is a major milestone, but there are still a number of unknown factors.\n\n\u201cAs we learn more about the role of antibodies, this could open the door to different ways of working and reduce the level of risk to NHS staff by allocating those who have had the virus to care for Covid-19 patients. But we must be clear that huge uncertainties remain while we do not know the level and length of any immunity which antibodies will offer.\n\n\u201cThe new test\u2019s arrival should not simply be seen as a green light to reduce PPE and other protections for NHS staff who test positive.\u201d\n\nEither Boris Johnson or Matt Hancock, the health secretary, is expected to make the announcement on Thursday, the Guardian understands.\n\nPublic Health England (PHE) validated two laboratory-based antibody tests from Swiss-based Roche and US-based Abbott last week, and another \u2013 from the Welsh firm Ortho Clinical Diagnostics \u2013 this week.\n\nInitially, priority will be given to frontline hospital personnel working most closely with Covid patients, such as intensive care staff, those working on coronavirus wards and doctors and nurses in A&E units. Scientists will monitor those who test positive to see whether their antibody levels drop over time and whether any of them fall ill again.\n\nDespite the lack of guaranteed immunity, one source with knowledge of the plan expressed hope that the tests would instil confidence in NHS workers. \u201cThe intention is that NHS and care staff will get these tests in the first instance to see if they\u2019ve had the virus, so that they can feel able to go back to work safely, knowing that they will have at least some immunity,\u201d the source said.\n\n\n\nA senior figure in the NHS added: \u201cAntibody tests for staff could be a real game-changer in letting hospitals restart services. However, they won\u2019t be able to tell us for months if people who have had the virus are immune.\u201d\n\nMeanwhile, a private testing bonanza looks set to take off, with private GP clinics and the high street chemist Superdrug offering antibody tests supplied by Abbott for sale to the public.\n\nOrtho Clinical Diagnostics\u2019 newly PHE-approved test outperformed the other two. Ortho, based in Cardiff for 40 years, says its test is 100% specific for Covid-19, which means it does not confuse the antibodies produced in response to the virus with those from other coronaviruses, including the common cold. Roche\u2019s test has been validated by PHE as 99.8% specific and Abbott\u2019s as 99.6% specific.\n\nThe Abbott tests sold by Superdrug for \u00a369 and private clinics such as Babylon and the Independent General Practice in Wales are \u201chome\u201d tests in that people can take a blood sample at home after buying the kit, but they must post it to a lab for processing.\n\nRapid fingerprick tests that give an instant result, like a pregnancy test, have not yet proved accurate enough for approval.\n\nThe accuracy of the Superdrug test is given on their website as 97.5% because people will have to lance their finger to obtain blood themselves rather than have a health professional do it, which adds the risk of error.\n\nScientists emphasised warnings over the risks of antibody tests for the public. \u201cIf a person takes a test and gets a false positive, they may assume they have been exposed and that they have immunity when they do not,\u201d said Adam Finn, professor of paediatrics at the University of Bristol.\n\n\u201cSo the bottom line is: don\u2019t spend money and time on any test unless you have a very clear idea of what the result does or does not mean for you and what you are going to do or not do if you get a positive or negative result.\u201d\n\nDr Simon Clarke, associate professor in cellular microbiology at the University of Reading, said the tests were \u201cgood for satisfying people\u2019s curiosity, but no more\u201d.\n\n\u201cHaving these antibodies is a reliable way of confirming that someone has been infected previously. Their presence does not indicate that someone is immune, and it should be remembered that any post-infection immunity may dwindle rapidly \u2026 We just don\u2019t know enough about what it takes to make someone immune to Covid-19 to accurately test people,\u201d he said.\n\nOrtho Clinical Diagnostics has two lab-based tests. PHE has validated the first of these, which detects a single antibody called IGG, and is expected to validate the other, which detects all antibodies produced, this week. Paul Hackworth, its UK managing director, said both were 100% specific for Covid-19.\n\n\u201cWe are the only one of the major companies [producing antibody tests] with UK manufacturing,\u201d he said. \u201cThat helps with the supply chain.\u201d Their machines are already common in hospital labs, he said, and are easier than some to run because they do not require a water supply, but just plug into an electric socket. The machines can run 150 tests an hour.\n\nThere were various uses for the test, he said. \u201cThe sense we get is that initially it will be used in returning staff and to serve the needs of the vaccine,\u201d he said. It will be important to find out how quickly antibody levels that are raised after vaccination wane over time.\n\nThe other major use of antibody tests is across populations, to find out what proportion of people have been infected. They can help decide whether some groups of people are more likely to get infected than others and whether there are regional variations. Several studies have already begun, including one from Biobank, which is planning to test 20,000 participants, their children and grandchildren.\n\nStephen Powis, NHS England\u2019s national medical director, confirmed at the Downing Street briefing that antibody tests would be given first to NHS and care home patients and staff. \u201cThey will be rolled out through health and social care settings. Their use will be in those settings and surveillance so we get some impression of how many people in this population have been infected by the virus,\u201d he said.\n\nHe cautioned against the use of tests available to the public for use at home. \u201cThe antibody test shows you that you have had the virus. What we don\u2019t absolutely know at the moment is whether having antibodies means that you won\u2019t get the virus again,\u201d he said.

Which it isn\u2019t, which it definitely isn\u2019t.\u201d\n\nAsked whether the data was showing any repercussions, Ammon gave a deadpan answer. \u201cNot yet. I mean, maybe it doesn\u2019t come ever, maybe all the adjustment of these measures is done in a prudent way. This is something we are really right now are closely monitoring: what is happening after all these measures.\u201d\n\nAs of Wednesday 158,134 people have died from Covid-19 in the EU and the UK, Norway, Liechtenstein and Iceland, according to ECDC data for the countries the agency monitors.\n\nThe UK has the highest level of deaths in Europe, with 35,341, followed by Italy (32,169) and France (28,022).\n\nA total of 1,324,183 cases of infection have been reported. Among those is a member of Ammon\u2019s own staff. Only a skeleton group of fewer than 10 now work in the agency\u2019s office in Stockholm.\n\n\u201cPart of our crisis team that needs to be there because they need very close cooperation. But they\u2019re sitting wide apart. Honestly. We have to do what we preach.\u201d\n\nAmmon recalls that it was only in late January that it had become clear that a novel virus causing a cluster of deaths in the Chinese city of Wuhan could be transmitted human to human, with initial concerns focusing on the possibility of the disease spreading through imports.\n\nAs the extremely contagious nature of the virus emerged, the ECDC advised governments on 26 January to strengthen the capacities of their health services. There was fear of them being overwhelmed, as was shortly to be the case with tragic results in Lombardy in northern Italy.\n\n\u201cWe did really emphasise that these plans have to be updated. And in particular, the hospital preparedness needs to be looked at, how to make sure to have a surge capacity for beds, in general, but also in particular for intensive care unit beds.\n\n\u201cI think what turned out is that [the governments] underestimated, in my view, the speed of how this increase came. Because, I mean, you know, it\u2019s a different situation if you have to look for an increase capacity of beds within two weeks or within two days.\u201d\n\nAmmon believes that when the inevitable inquiries look into the twists and turns of the crisis, the return of holidaymakers from Alpine skiing breaks in the first week of March will be seen as a pivotal moment in the spread of Covid-19 into Europe.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest A tourist wearing a protective respiratory mask in Rome on 28 February. Photograph: Andreas Solaro/AFP via Getty Images\n\n\u201cBecause at that time we saw that new cases all over Europe [and] actually [they] had been in the skiing places in the Alps, in Italy, Austria. I mean this is a crowded place, the ski resorts, and then you have these cabins that you go up the mountain and these are really crammed. Yeah, it\u2019s just perfect for such a virus. I mean I am pretty sure that this contributed to the wide spread in Europe.\u201d\n\nLockdowns followed \u2013 a theoretical possibility in the pandemic planning that few believed was feasible. \u201cI remember when China put the lockdown to Wuhan, people told me, \u2018Look this wouldn\u2019t be possible in Europe.\u2019 Hmm.\u201d\n\nNow the lockdowns were straining the public\u2019s tolerance, she said, but questioned whether they still came in too late and whether swifter action could have saved more lives. \u201cI believe if we would have put in these measures earlier, it might have been possible, but \u2026 these measures are so stark, I mean they are so out of our experience that it, I think it needed \u2026 unfortunately the situation in northern Italy to make everybody clear that it is necessary.\u201d\n\nAmmon now believes the battle with coronavirus will be a long haul. \u201cI don\u2019t know whether it\u2019s forever but I don\u2019t think it will go away very quickly. It seems to be very well adapted to humans.\u201d\n\nShe is yet to book a summer holiday and warns those craving a break away to prepare for some disappointment. \u201cWhat we are saying is that they should be prepared that even if there are some holidays and they go somewhere, it will not be comparable to what they had last year. At this stage we cannot say you can go out there, wash your hands and everything is fine. You have to keep your distance. These measures have to be in place.\u201d\n\nBut despite the privations of recent months, Ammon expresses little sympathy for the argument put forward by some, including the former supreme court judge Jonathan Sumption that merely shielding the elderly would have been sufficient.\n\n\u201cPeople who are perfectly healthy are also getting severe illness and they die. Knowing what we have seen in Europe with approximately 10% of the population [infected] I think there is for me not an option to let this go. If the the other 90% would have come as well, I think we don\u2019t want to think of this.\u201d", "author": ["Daniel Boffey", "Rowland Kao"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/video/2020/may/20/who-do-you-trust-on-coronavirus-from-trudeau-to-piers-morgan-a-new-normal", "published": "2020-05-20T11:53:20", "title": "Who do you trust on coronavirus?

Prof John Ashton, a former regional director of public health and regional medical officer for the north-west of England, describes his experience of contact tracing at the early stages of the coronavirus crisis and highlights pitfalls the UK should avoid.\n\n\u201cIn early February I was invited to Bahrain to examine the country\u2019s preparedness for Covid-19. The first case, that of a religious pilgrim returning from a visit to holy sites in Iran, was diagnosed while I was in Bahrain on 24 February.\n\nQ&A What is contact tracing? Show Hide Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person. Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street. It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation. South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country. Sarah Boseley Health editor\n\n\u201cThe first thing I asked for was a tour around the island state to visit key places where the virus might make an entry: air and sea ports, the road causeway with its heavily used link to Saudi Arabia, the main prison, public health laboratories and each of the hospital estates, as well as housing projects for migrant workers.\n\n\u201cTogether with members of the Covid task force that had been set up in early February, I spoke to all those in leadership positions to seek out weaknesses in the chain of epidemic control and to assess the capacity for an effective public health response.\n\n\u201cAmong other things, we were exploring forensically for weak spots where the virus could get hold, replicate and spread. At this early stage we were able to identify that a lack of testing capacity was an issue, and in mid-February I was able to advise the crown prince, Salman bin Hamad al-Khalifa, and the Supreme Health Council to urgently order more supplies and equipment, a recommendation that was immediately acted on.\n\n\u201cThe result is that although Bahrain has a population of under 2 million, the Bahrainis are doing far more testing now per head of population than say, Wales, which has double its population. In practical terms, at Bahrain airport, where screening and triaging of all arriving passengers has been in place for three months, up to 1,000 passengers coming from affected parts of the world, or who might be manifesting early symptoms of infection, have been routinely tested for coronavirus.\n\n\u201cThis has been followed up by a systematic approach to isolation, quarantine, contact tracing and treatment with a large measure of success. As of last week 6,000 tests were being carried out daily with 4,000 cases of diagnosed infection; at that time there had only been eight deaths.\n\n\u201cWith the Bahrain situation in mind together with my own long experience of public health in England, I see several pitfalls ahead for the contact-tracing system in Britain unless things are put right urgently. One problem for instance is the use of test kits sent through the postal service. It should be remembered that the swabs needed to be taken from a person\u2019s nose and throat are quite invasive. Mistakes can be made and there is the risk that an inadequate sample is taken, resulting in a false negative report.\n\n\u201cAnother potential problem in the current recruitment system for contact-tracing staff is the lack of local knowledge. Ideally the national contact-tracing system should be decentralised and put into the hands of local public health specialists, who know their populations and are able to fully engage with them.\n\n\u201cMy fear is that we recruit an army of people working in call centres who are hundreds of miles from an area they are dealing with. There are thousands of experienced environmental health officers together with currently furloughed local government civil servants out there who could be recruited into the call pool who have the detailed knowledge to engage with their local communities and ensure a high-quality test, track and trace service.\u201d", "author": ["Henry Mcdonald"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/20/coronavirus-uk-map-the-latest-deaths-and-confirmed-cases-in-each-region", "published": "2020-05-20T09:18:25", "title": "Coronavirus UK map: the latest deaths and confirmed cases in each region", "text": "Latest figures from public health authorities on the spread of Covid-19 in the United Kingdom.

The upshot was a debate that was more political than scientific.\n\n\u201cMy feeling is that this is becoming more of a statement, a statement of solidarity. By going out and wearing a face mask you show that you are taking action, you show other people you are concerned about this, you are concerned about them, you are concerned about yourself.

There is particular concern about south-west England, where a large swell and a spring tide could make conditions particularly hazardous.\n\nGareth Morrison, the RNLI head of water safety, said: \u201cIf the charity\u2019s lifeguards were present on the beaches today, they would be preventing many incidents before they even occurred by directing people to safe swimming areas, highlighting dangers such as rip currents and advising people not to use inflatables.\u201d\n\nThe campaign features the slogan: \u201cBeach lifeguards can\u2019t be everywhere this summer.\u201d\n\n\u201cIt is important that anyone visiting the coast understands that the beach can be a dangerous environment and you must take more responsibility for you and your family this summer.\u201d\n\nClaire Hughes, the director of HM Coastguard, said: \u201cWe know from sad experience that whether you\u2019re local or not, whatever your ability of experience in your chosen sport or leisure activity, the sea can still catch you out and be unmerciful when it does. Now more than ever, we need people to respect the sea and the coast. If you get into trouble call 999 and ask for the coastguard and we will come to your aid.\u201d\n\nThe two organisations are asking people not to use inflatables and to take precautions such as checking the weather forecast and timetables.\n\nThe Welsh government has increased the maximum fine for repeated breaches of the coronavirus lockdown rules in Wales from \u00a3120 to \u00a31,920.\n\nThe increased fines are being introduced ahead of the bank holiday weekend following a request from the four police forces in Wales for increased penalties to help deter people from repeatedly breaching the stay-at-home regulations.\n\nThe first minister, Mark Drakeford, said: \u201cAs we approach the bank holiday weekend, we continue to ask people to stay at home to protect themselves and their loved ones from coronavirus.

Oxfam will honour its existing commitments to its partners and donors.\n\nVera said: \u201cLooking strategically at where and how we operate is the essential first step in ensuring that Oxfam can continue to make the best possible contribution to fighting inequality to end poverty and injustice, and to influence for change as effectively as possible. We\u2019ve been planning this for some time but we are now accelerating key decisions in light of the effects of the global pandemic.\n\n\u201cIn some countries, Oxfam will have a deeper footprint as we focus our programme resources and strengthen our local partnerships to maximise impact. In others we will focus more strongly on our humanitarian or influencing goals.\n\n\u201cInevitably, we have had to make some very difficult choices about where we will no longer have a physical presence. This reorganisation will take time to complete. We feel a deep sense of responsibility to the countries where offices will be closed and we will do everything we can to ensure the people we work with will be able to look to the future with confidence.

It was also criticised over its response to separate accusations relating to abuse of children in Haiti.\n\nA damning Charity Commission report last year found \u201cserious problems with the culture, morale and behaviour\u201d of Oxfam staff in Haiti at the time, concluding that the organisation had suffered from oversight issues over a number of years.\n\n\u201cWhat went wrong in Haiti did not happen in isolation,\u201d the report concluded. \u201cOur inquiry demonstrates that, over a period of years, Oxfam\u2019s internal culture tolerated poor behaviour, and at times lost sight of the values it stands for,\u201d said Helen Stephenson, chief executive of the Charity Commission.\n\n\n\n", "author": ["Peter Beaumont"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/live/2020/may/20/coronavirus-us-live-trump-1m-cases-badge-honor-reopen-latest-news-updates", "published": "2020-05-21T00:44:22", "title": "Supreme court blocks House Democrats' access to Mueller grand jury materials \u2013 live", "text": "18:19\n\nPrisoners and advocates told the Guardian that some infected inmates are in isolation without medical care or adequate food, cut off from family and attorneys\n\nMore than 3,200 prisoners in California have contracted Covid-19 and at least 16 inmates have died, in a public health catastrophe that advocates say was both predictable and preventable.\n\n\n\nInmates and advocates told the Guardian that at six prisons and jails with rapidly escalating outbreaks, basic protocols to prevent the virus from spreading are being ignored, and that they fear imminent mass fatalities and hospitalizations.

The idea was that if they could suppress infections until the late spring, the change in temperature might help to stop the virus in its tracks.\n\nThat wasn\u2019t to be. Scientific advice now suggests that temperature in and of itself has limited effect on Covid-19\u2019s spread. Yet as the death toll continues to rise, prayers for sunny weather from government are louder than ever. Why? To help keep people onside over what has the potential to be a long, dull, stay-at-home British summer.\n\nWith the prime minister, Boris Johnson, pitting himself against the bulk of his party over a gradual rather than a rapid easing of lockdown, the UK is now on course to move at a more stately pace than its European counterparts when it comes to socialising, the reopening of bars \u2013 and holidays. While the EU has a three-stage plan to restart tourism, and Italy and Spain aim to reopen for visitors as early as June, the UK is taking a rather different approach.\n\nGlobal report: Italy reopens cafes as Spain prepares for return of tourists Read more\n\nNext month, a two-week quarantine is being introduced for all new arrivals to the UK, including British people returning from abroad. The move has been heavily criticised by the travel industry, with one trade body warning it will have a \u201cdevastating\u201d impact on the UK aviation industry and the wider economy.\n\nHowever, with Johnson determined to press on with what one No 10 adviser describes as the \u201cslow and steady\u201d path out of lockdown, the focus in government is not on appeasing airline companies but working out how to keep a potentially restless British public onside while its neighbours holiday.\n\nEven if talks of \u201cair bridges\u201d \u2013 allowing quarantine-free travel to and from low-infection countries such as Greece \u2013 come to fruition, the general sense in government is that the bulk of Britons will not be jetting abroad this summer.\n\nAs well as quarantine and safety concerns, the economic reality means extravagant holidays just won\u2019t be an option for many. With unemployment set to increase even further and many on reduced household incomes, holidays are likely to be a luxury that people cannot afford. Social distancing practices mean that budget flights, too, could soon become much harder to find.\n\nAs a result, ministers have begun to work out what they can do to keep morale up over the long summer months. While public support is now very much for lockdown continuing, the worry is what happens when other countries enjoy breaks with more ease. \u201cIf the R number rises in these countries as a result, we\u2019ll be praised for our response \u2013 if it doesn\u2019t, we might start to get some heat,\u201d explains one government figure.\n\nThe great hope is that the weather gods will shine on the UK. The evidence suggests that activity outside carries a much lower risk of transmission than inside. Just look at how Northern Ireland is now allowing a half dozen people from different households to gather, if they are outside. All the plans to relax socialising coming down the tracks are based on being outside. \u201cIf it rains, we\u2019re fucked,\u201d says one rather blunt Tory MP.\n\n\u201cBritain\u2019s going to look like the 1940s this summer,\u201d predicts a government insider privy to discussions. Expect Mr Whippys on Bournemouth beach, camping breaks and, if we\u2019re lucky, drive-in cinemas.\n\nTalks are under way across departments to see what can be done to help retail businesses move outside. There is a focus on encouraging local councils to make it easy to cut red tape for businesses so they can adapt to a new normal in which trading outside is the preferred option. Inside No 10, one good-case scenario for mid-summer is that people will be permitted to dine outside at a restaurant with someone they don\u2019t live with.\n\nWhile restaurants and cafes are viewed as potential beneficiaries of good weather, the prospects for a lazy summer afternoon in the pub are bleaker. The concern is that the low cost of a pint means that it won\u2019t be financially viable for a pub to open its garden while taking in just a small number of people \u2013 whereas a more expensive restaurant could manage. But entrepreneurial landlords will be encouraged to think outside the box.\n\nThe first holiday likely to be allowed will be camping \u2013 if that works out, then private home hire could be next. Hotels are viewed as harder to reopen due to the number of people coming and going. Discussions are under way over an extended holiday season \u2013 not just the typical high season of peak summer months \u2013 given that changing circumstances mean the traditional holiday period cannot be relied upon.\n\nMinisters are considering promoting parts of the UK that are usually off the tourist trail. With an increase expected in the number of domestic tourists, it\u2019s not only viewed as an opportunity to promote undiscovered spots \u2013 it could also be what\u2019s needed to keep MPs on side. On Tory WhatsApp, Devon and Cornwall MPs are already worried about an influx of people to their constituencies \u2013 with locals concerned about the virus spreading. However, in No 10 there\u2019s a sense that \u201ccommon sense\u201d will allow everyone an opportunity to explore.\n\nHowever, for all the efforts to keep the UK entertained this summer, the biggest risk factor may be not the weather but the economy. The furlough scheme is up for review in August and companies will be asked to pay a higher contribution. There is concern among MPs that this could be a crunch point for high unemployment. If that comes to pass, no amount of ice-cream by the coast or sitting around campfires will be enough to distract from the bad times ahead.\n\n\u2022 Katy Balls is the Spectator\u2019s deputy political editor", "author": ["Katy Balls"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/nudge-theory-brexit-divide-lockdown-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-20T13:30:31", "title": "Nudge theory could heal Brexit Britain's divide over lockdown", "text": "T\n\nhere was a rare moment of relative unity in the UK at the start of April when nine out of 10 people said they supported the lockdown. However, as the government seeks to ease the lockdown, a polarised landscape is starting to re-emerge, the fault lines reflecting attitudes toward Brexit. A recent YouGov survey found that 47% of leavers supported the government\u2019s easing of the lockdown compared with 26% of remainers.\n\nRemainers and leavers both indicated high levels of support for letting people exercise outside more than once a day, but YouGov found that leavers showed more support than remainers for allowing people to play tennis or golf, visit garden centres, meet one friend, sit and sunbathe in public areas like parks, and encourage people to return to work.\n\nWhy would support for Brexit correlate with attitudes towards easing the lockdown? One might think this is simply due to confirmation bias. Brexit supporters who backed Boris might be motivated to look out for evidence that their candidate is doing a good job. I suspect, however, the factors driving polarised responses to coronavirus run deeper than that. To understand these factors, it\u2019s helpful to look back on some of the psychological characteristics of people who supported leave or remain.\n\nTwo of these differences can be explained by what American social psychologist Jonathan Haidt describes as \u201cthe moral intuitions\u201d, the underlying values that shape how we think about politics. Remainers placed more emphasis on the value of care and the need to minimise harm, whereas leavers placed more emphasis on the value of personal liberty. When evaluating an action or a policy, remainers would ask \u201cwill this cause harm?\u201d, whereas leavers would be inclined to ask \u201cwill something restrict our freedom?\u201d.\n\nThis emphasis on care/harm versus liberty has quite logical consequences in terms of how opinions divide on easing from the lockdown. The emphasis on care and minimising harm puts the focus on reducing the spread of the disease at all costs. Interestingly, the care/harm reasoning is stronger among women. This might help to explain the gender difference in concern around coronavirus, and why male and female leaders have responded differently to the first wave of the virus. We also know that endorsement of liberty is associated with vaccine hesitancy, so we can expect those who are opposed to further lockdown to also be more likely to oppose a mandatory vaccine.\n\nWe might disagree with the values underlying people\u2019s political beliefs, but understanding the depth of moral sentiment that shapes these different responses could provide a more effective basis for communication or persuasion. Neglecting to do so risks getting us back to a position where people stop listening to the other side \u2013 not because they don\u2019t have good ideas, but simply because they are in the \u201cother\u201d camp.\n\nIn other domains where we critically need collective action in order to avert further crisis, a deeper understanding of the moral values underpinning politically polarised positions has resulted in more persuasive communication. Indeed, American sociologist Robb Willer and colleagues have argued that the left in particular needs to learn how to better engage with moral intuitions of the right in communications designed to tackle challenges like climate change. A lesson adopted by centre-left leaders like Barack Obama, who framed the investment in renewables as an issue of national security.\n\nFinding a policy response that reconciles the tension between concerns for liberty and care was actually at the heart of the original formulation of the idea of a \u201cnudge\u201d. The concept has got something of a bad press after it was associated with herd immunity, so let\u2019s set the record straight, nudge theory has nothing to do with herd immunity.\n\nChicago University economist Richard Thaler and legal scholar Cass Sunstein originally developed the concept of nudge as a reconciliation between \u201cpaternalistic\u201d state intervention and the liberty of the individual. One of their key insights is that providing people with information regarding the right thing to do, is often not sufficient to change behaviour. It is sometimes necessary to make structural changes to people\u2019s environments to make the desired behaviour easy. Hospital staff, for example, know that washing their hands is important, but are still more likely to do so if hand sanitiser is easily available and visible in the hospital.\n\nAs we explore how to safely restore some personal freedoms while minimising the harm caused by the spread of the virus, we will need people to engage in a range of behaviours, from social distancing to washing their hands, wearing masks, download tracing apps, and (hopefully one day) getting vaccinated. Governments have a huge role to play in structuring our daily environments to make it easy to engage in the behaviours we need to engage in. Telling people to follow \u201ccommon sense\u201d is likely to prove a lot less effective than making masks easily available, or making hand sanitisers more widespread in public buildings.\n\nThere is no quick fix to Get Corona Done. However, behavioural science can help create new habits to slow the rate of infection until a vaccine is created \u2013 and a little bit of understanding of the values behind people\u2019s beliefs will go a long way to avoid the spread of further division.\n\n\u2022 Lee de Wit is a lecturer in political psychology at Cambridge University", "author": ["Lee De Wit"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/post-coronavirus-uk-alliances-stand-up-china-us", "published": "2020-05-20T16:57:07", "title": "Post-coronavirus, the UK must find some friends to stand up to China | Martin Kettle", "text": "Amid the pandemic, the great issues of the day are inescapably immediate and health-centred.

But when the Obama administration\u2019s US ambassador to the United Nations, Samantha Power, was asked this week by the Commons foreign affairs committee to assess Covid-19\u2019s impact on the global order, she turned first and without hesitation to China\u2019s rise.\n\nCovid-19, said Power in her evidence, has accelerated all the trends. The US is now decoupling decisively from China. The developing world, bound to China by the debt and dependency of the \u201cbelt and road\u201d strategies, is in contrast binding more firmly to it. China\u2019s \u201cwolf-warrior\u201d diplomacy against states that criticise it is increasingly aggressive. Meanwhile, in the global forums, China is stepping in to fill the vacuum left by Donald Trump\u2019s US. Chinese president Xi Jinping, said Power, is now well on his way to supplanting the postwar order based on the western alliance with a new China-centred network.\n\nPlay Video 1:21 White House: US-China relationship one of 'disappointment and frustration' - video\n\nFor proof of this, look no further than what happened at the World Health Organization assembly in Geneva this week. On the one hand, Trump spent the week slagging off the WHO, threatening to withdraw all US funding, promoting quack medical remedies and attacking China. On the other, Xi addressed the assembly, donated $2bn to the WHO for the coronavirus battle, called for a vaccine to be made available to all, and successfully watered down the planned post-pandemic international investigation into Covid-19. Having done that, Xi slapped a punitive 80% tariff on Australian barley to punish Canberra for pressing for a fuller, more independent Covid-19 probe. Stand by, if it takes place, for a similar Xi approach at the postponed Cop26 climate conference.\n\nAs the world emerges from its coronavirus bunker, governments will discover a fast changing geopolitical landscape. It will be one in which the authoritarian pull exerted by China is now steadily outmuscling the democratic and rights-based push of what used to be the US-led western alliance. A potent catalyst for this has been Trump\u2019s unilateral retreat into American nativism. But, as Power pointed out, the authoritarian process can be measured in other ways too, including China\u2019s increasing use of cyber warfare against international Covid-19 critics, the more than 80 countries currently governed by emergency pandemic legislation and the upwards of 50 nations in which elections have been postponed, almost without debate.\n\nAt this point, we must ask what role Britain should play in this new global order. That question lies behind Power\u2019s appearance at the Commons foreign affairs committee this week. It is examining the Johnson government\u2019s \u201cintegrated review\u201d of Britain\u2019s foreign, defence, security and development policy, announced in February. This review was originally conceived as a root-and-branch recalibration of Britain\u2019s role in the world after Brexit. But it has now inescapably evolved into a review of the global post-coronavirus reset too.\n\nCovid-19 is obviously part of any explanation about why the China issue has become a lot more volatile and salient in British politics. It is only 10 years since Tony Blair could write that Britain should ensure that Europe, in partnership with America, should offer China a new global partnership. Every aspect of that proposition has now gone. Britain is no longer part of Europe. Europe is itself in existential difficulty. The US is no longer a partner. Meanwhile China has forged ahead on its own.\n\nUS message to Britain in bilateral trade talks: it's us \u2013 or China Read more\n\nBut it is not just the Blair approach that is long gone. In his own memoirs, David Cameron explains how he advocated an economic \u201clong game\u201d with China that would give Britain greater political leverage \u201cto bring China into the rules-based international system \u2013 through rules on trade, but also rules on climate change, terrorism and human rights.\u201d Cameron even took Xi for a pint in a pub near Chequers. But where, in the Trump era, is that rules-based system now? And where, post-Brexit, is Britain\u2019s leverage in that or any other global order?\n\nJohnson\u2019s Conservative party is struggling to find a plausible answer to this last question. Perhaps the integrated review will provide it. If so, it will need to come up with an extremely realistic containment strategy towards China. This would need to echo the approach \u2013 an alliance based on rules, values and engagement to face down the Soviet Union without tipping into nuclear war \u2013 that the American diplomat George Kennan crafted in 1946, and which shaped US foreign policy for nearly half a century. Yet it would have to do it in the full knowledge that the UK is nowhere near as powerful as the US was in the postwar world, that the US has defected to isolationism, and that Brexit Britain is itself seen \u2013 and partly sees itself \u2013 as an alliance breaker.\n\nChina in 2020 is not the USSR in 1946. But there is little sign that the Tory party is anywhere close to agreeing on the mature, long-term strategy on China that is needed. The cold war and Euroscepticism both cast long shadows. The bulk of newer Tory MPs, many of them active in the new China Research Group of MPs chaired by the foreign affairs committee chair Tom Tugendhat, now think about China as a threat but regard European allies as the past and thus lack any workable strategy for constraining Chinese power.\n\nYet Covid-19 has made the question of how to stand up to China more pressing than before. The dilemmas are not restricted to the Tory party or to Britain. Labour has notably toughened its line, as its China spokesman Stephen Kinnock made clear this week. But no single nation state, even the US, can stand up to China and its authoritarian model without alliances, without patient deployment of hard and soft power, and without a readiness to make tactical compromises.\n\nThe answer for a medium-sized power like Britain is to have an alliance-based and institutions-based containment strategy and to work with Germany, France, the EU, India, Australia and others to achieve a relationship with China that rejects both Chinese and American bullying. The problem is that this is the one thing that this government, besotted with its self-image of Britain as an independent, buccaneering world player, cannot bring itself to do.\n\n\u2022 Martin Kettle is a Guardian columnist", "author": ["Martin Kettle"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/20/british-schools-science-children-education-testing-tracing", "published": "2020-05-20T07:00:19", "title": "When should British schools reopen? Here's what the science tells us | Devi Sridhar and Ines Hassan", "text": "The big debate over the past few days has been whether it\u2019s safe to open schools to children other than those those of key workers or classed as vulnerable. However, this isn\u2019t quite the right question to be asking. There will never be no risk. In a world where Covid-19 remains present in the community, it\u2019s about how we reduce that risk, just as we do with other kinds of daily dangers, like driving and cycling. What we should be asking is whether schools are safe enough to open. To answer this, of course, you have to have data. What is needed to inform decisions is information and real-time monitoring, at the local level, to tell us what the daily number of new cases and rate of transmission is. Those concrete numbers should be what drives policy, not a set of abstract arguments, even less an ideological battle.\n\nIn the absence of this data, the proposal to reopen schools in England on 1 June remains controversial among teaching unions, the British Medical Association, staff and parents alike. Our view is that schools should reopen as soon as possible, but this must form part of a larger system of \u201ctest, trace and isolate\u201d strategies, proper support and full transparency about the trade-offs involved and the large scientific uncertainty.\n\nThat scientific uncertainty surrounds two key questions: the first is the degree to which children can transmit the virus to teachers and parents. The second is the number of children likely to develop a severe multisystem inflammatory syndrome several weeks after exposure to coronavirus. A recent study in the Lancet found a thirtyfold increase in children presenting with this condition in Lombardy, Italy, and the research team warned that other countries experiencing Sars-CoV-2 outbreaks would probably also see a rise in cases. The numbers were small and the evidence suggests that the syndrome is likely to be uncommon but, given that we still don\u2019t have data on exactly how many children have been exposed to the virus, we can\u2019t make a calculation as to how rare it actually is.\n\nElsewhere, we see that Denmark, Norway, Germany and New Zealand are starting to reopen their schools, which raises the question of why those countries might be in a position to do so while the UK is not. Politicians desperate for answers point to a preliminary study from New South Wales in Australia that found that \u201cclose contact\u201d in schools resulted in very little transmission. However, one major caveat is that research was conducted during a period when attendance had dropped to 5%, enabling true physical distancing. In addition, early widespread implementation of community testing, contact tracing and isolation of carriers across the country has helped to manage the number of cases. Australia is therefore easing its lockdown against a background of solid control of the virus. The lesson from there and other nations with similarly effective regimes is that the UK needs to suppress the virus and ensure that public health infrastructure is ready to detect new infections and identify clusters rapidly.\n\nGiven the difficulties around maintaining physical distance in overcrowded state schools, we need to identify innovative strategies involving the use of larger spaces, phased re-entry, or both. In Denmark, some schools have made use of spaces, such as a football stadium, that aren\u2019t currently being used. This may be a particularly useful tool in major cities with larger schools and class sizes. Germany has asked older children to return first, while New Zealand and Israel have prioritised the return of children who are from vulnerable homes, younger children who require adult supervision or pupils who have learning difficulties. The decision to prioritise younger pupils \u2013 because the early years are fundamental to reducing educational inequalities \u2013 or to focus on older pupils \u2013 because they are better able to follow physical distancing rules and have exams and graduation ahead \u2013 is a political one.\n\nFlexible thinking is key to balancing the competing demands of safety and educational need. In the UK this could mean schools returning early from the summer holidays. Schools in New Zealand and Thailand have revised the dates of holidays for the remainder of the calendar year to make up for the teaching time lost during the lockdown. All signs point to this virus hitting hard in the coming winter as flu season begins and activity moves largely indoors. We should make optimum use of the summer months to get schools prepared and able to function, alongside a strong public health infrastructure.\n\nGiven the higher number of coronavirus cases and active community transmission in the UK, a conservative, locally managed approach to schools reopening seems wise. For example, a system whereby the rate of transmission and the number of daily new cases in a given area must be below a set level before schools can reopen could be implemented \u2013 and then only if \u201ctest, trace, isolate\u201d, social distancing, and hygiene and surveillance measures are in place. These conditions should be agreed in consultation with teachers and school heads, and public health, child psychology and education experts.\n\nThe tragedy is that the countries that moved the fastest and \u201ccrunched the curve\u201d are those that never had to close schools, or are in a strong position to reopen them quickly. While the number of daily Covid-19 deaths grabs headlines, we must not forget the children experiencing hunger from loss of school meals, those living in abusive households and the widening educational deficit. While many scientific and logistical questions remain, what\u2019s clear is that children, especially those from disadvantaged backgrounds, are truly paying the price for the UK government\u2019s poor decisions over the past 12 weeks.\n\n\u2022 Devi Sridhar is chair of global public health at the University of Edinburgh.

Yet England\u2019s local public health directors have found themselves struggling to get a hearing, let alone a key role, in the fight against the deadly disease.\n\n\u201cIt is remarkable,\u201d says a rueful Jeanelle de Gruchy, the president of the Association of Directors of Public Health (ADPH), their representative body. \u201cI think it reflects a historic lack of understanding of the importance of public health. As a society we tend still to think that a healthy population is created by the NHS \u2013 and it\u2019s not.\u201d\n\nEngland's ravaged public health system just can't cope with the coronavirus | Gabriel Scally Read more\n\nDoes this lack of understanding extend to the highest reaches of government? \u201cWithout a doubt,\u201d she responds, while adding that she exempts the chief medical officer, Chris Whitty, who she says has sought to involve the ADPH from the start of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nDirectors of public health are senior doctors and other professionals, with further specialist qualifications, employed by the 150 bigger local councils to advise on health protection and health improvement and to lead on commissioning of services such as sexual health, drug and alcohol treatment, school nursing and health visiting. Their role is statutory and separate from that of Public Health England (PHE), the government agency that has faced criticism over its handling of the crisis.\n\nOver the past fortnight, the directors have belatedly been drawn closer into national Covid-19 planning: on 7 May, the care minister Helen Whately issued a letter admitting that the testing programme for the disease in care homes needed to be \u201cmore joined up\u201d and giving directors lead responsibility to coordinate and prioritise. Last Friday, the health secretary, Matt Hancock, pointedly spoke at the daily Covid-19 media briefing of \u201clocal public health officials playing such a critical role\u201d.\n\nThe directors are now hoping to be influential also in the rollout of community tracking and tracing of Covid-19 carriers: the appointment last week of Tom Riordan, the chief executive of Leeds council, to lead on tracing strategy is being seen as a key pointer.\n\nDe Gruchy is reluctant to dwell on what might have been. \u201cWe are now being recognised as having an important role. I hope that will continue,\u201d she says. \u201cWe need to do much better than handing down decisions to councils with a \u2018made in Westminster\u2019 label. That is what has been happening.\n\n\u201cWe are not saying it\u2019s one or the other, national or local. We are saying the scale of this is so large it needs to be multi-agency, a team of teams. Our position is that we want to be as constructive as possible, but as challenging as necessary.\u201d\n\nShe says her members will use their leadership role to ensure that testing is prioritised according to local needs and that people get clear advice on contact tracing. In a statement of principles on tracing, published on Monday, the ADPH identified 11 key issues including greater responsiveness, local flexibility and effective data-sharing among relevant agencies, expressing \u201cdisappointment at the limited extent that government has involved local government in all aspects of the test, track and trace programme\u201d.\n\nDe Gruchy is herself director of public health in Tameside, part of the Greater Manchester devolution partnership, and she operates de facto across both local government and the NHS. She says this has made it immeasurably easier to organise integrated responses to the Covid-19 crisis, especially on tracking and tracing, distribution of personal protective equipment, domestic abuse under lockdown and humanitarian measures. Some of her staff have been seconded to food banks.\n\nElsewhere, however, argument persists over the wisdom of the transfer of public health duties from the NHS in England to local government in 2013. And the crisis has raked over the coals. Would the overall response have been better, some ask, if the function had remained in the health service alongside hospital and community services?\n\nDe Gruchy insists not. \u201cWe absolutely need to be in local government,\u201d she says. \u201cWe feel strongly that given the range of influences on health and wellbeing \u2013 and remember that healthcare contributes to only 10% to 20% of all our health \u2013 we are in exactly the right place to bring about change.\n\n\u201cBut more than that, the NHS is fundamentally just not set up to focus resources on [illness] prevention. Yes it\u2019s one of the best healthcare systems in the world, but its main focus is still on acute hospital care. And that\u2019s where the money goes.\u201d\n\nShe concedes that the cause of public health in local government in England was not helped by cuts totalling \u00a3850m in its earmarked government grant between 2014-15 and 2019-20. Research has suggested that the burden of resulting service reductions fell heaviest on deprived inner-city communities. In mid-March this year, just as Covid-19 was taking hold, ministers made an exceptionally late announcement of a real-terms increase of \u00a3145m in grant for 2020-21.\n\nWhile welcoming the boost, De Gruchy reckons the system still needs \u00a3850m to get back to where it was in 2014, after allowing for population change. And she fears the impact of the present crisis on local government finances. \u201cThere needs to be proper recognition of the importance of \u2018local\u2019 to really get us out of this crisis \u2013 and if you recognise local, you have to fund local.\u201d\n\nBrought up in South Africa, where she qualified as a hospital doctor, De Gruchy moved in the late 1990s to the UK where she found her public health vocation and further trained for the role. She thinks the experience of growing up under apartheid primarily shaped her strong belief in social justice, but she also credits her family background \u2013 she comes, she says, from \u201ca family of theologians\u201d \u2013 and her experience as a gay woman. Covid permitting, she plans to marry her partner next January in a ceremony in South Africa.\n\nShe thinks the crisis has laid bare the deep inequalities in the UK. \u201cIt\u2019s held up a mirror to society,\u201d she says. \u201cIt\u2019s people from particular deprived communities who are dying, it\u2019s people from BME communities, it\u2019s older people in care homes which have been calling for improved funding for a long time.\n\n\u201cWe don\u2019t want to go back to normal after this. There are some things about normal I really liked, like seeing my friends and family, going out for a meal once in a while and, yes, going to the hairdresser. But the normal I don\u2019t want to go back to is hidden inequalities, hidden poverty, hidden discrimination against groups of people. I want us to use this crisis moment to ensure that what comes next is better.\u201d\n\nCurriculum vitae\n\nAge: 55\n\nLives: Manchester\n\nFamily: Engaged (and hoping wedding goes ahead)\n\nEducation: Westerford high school, Cape Town, South Africa; University of Cape Town (BA English & history, MBChB medicine); Loughborough University (MA sociology & social policy); Nottingham University (MPH public health)\n\nCareer: 2018-present: director of public health, Tameside council; 2010-18: director of public health, Haringey council/NHS, north London; 2005-10: deputy director of public health, Nottingham NHS; 2000-05: public health training including 12 months at the Department for International Development; 1995-2000: range of clinical roles in UK and South Africa, including co-author of health and human rights study for South African Truth and Reconciliation Commission\n\nInterests: Swimming, running, cycling, brunch", "author": ["David Brindle"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/education/2020/may/20/students-are-you-thinking-of-deferring-your-entry-to-university-this-year", "published": "2020-05-20T09:50:43", "title": "Students: are you thinking of deferring your entry to university this year?", "text": "We would like to hear from students who are looking to start their first year at university in September\n\nStudents: are you thinking of deferring your entry to university this year?\n\nCambridge University has decided to move all \u201cface-to-face lectures\u201d online for the full 2020-21 academic year.\n\nWe want to hear from prospective first year students who are thinking of postponing their entry to university this year.\n\nShare your thoughts\n\nAre you thinking of deferring entry or thinking about waiting a year?

NGN is a subsidiary of News UK, which is run by Rebekah Brooks and ultimately controlled by Rupert Murdoch, through the parent company News Corporation.\n\nThe plaintiffs name Lewis in a 139-page document that was made public by Mr Justice Mann at a remote case management hearing of the case of phone hacking by claimants against NGN. The case is due to go to trial in October.\n\nLewis said: \u201cThe allegation that I was involved in any wrongdoing is completely untrue.\u201d\n\nLewis, who worked at the Sunday Times in the early 2000s, rejoined the Murdoch family-owned newspapers in 2010. A year later he was seconded to run the controversial management and standards committee tasked with cleaning up after the phone-hacking scandal. The scandal came to a head over the Milly Dowler affair, resulting in the closure of the News of the World, then the UK\u2019s biggest-selling Sunday newspaper, and the Leveson inquiry into the culture of the press.\n\nIn an interview with the Evening Standard in 2017, Lewis said: \u201cIf you want to win a popularity contest in life, don\u2019t do these kind of jobs. The company faced an existential threat and it has a moral purpose to speak truth to power. We have a purpose to tell readers and the public about doing bad things but using legal methods. I did my bit to help with the legal process. I feel very sorry for the victims.\u201d\n\nLewis, 51, became the Daily Telegraph\u2019s youngest editor-in-chief in 2006.\n\nHamlins, the lead lawyers for the remaining 50 phone-hacking claimants, have added him to the overall pleaded case.\n\nLewis appears in a lengthy document, called the \u201cre-amended particulars of concealment and destruction\u201d, alongside 20 senior NGN employees alleged to have had knowledge of, or involvement in, phone hacking, made public in court on Wednesday. Other senior executives in the document include Brooks, James Murdoch and Andy Coulson, the former editor of the News of the World.\n\nThe claimants allege \u201cLewis was heavily and directly involved in the email deletion strategy\u201d. And that he was \u201cpart of the senior management which organised or allowed extensive deletions of millions of emails to take place without preserving backups \u2026 even though he was aware of the need to preserve data for the civil claims \u2026 and the live police investigation\u201d.\n\nAllegations against Lewis have also been put into evidence in a witness statement by Callum Galbraith, a lawyer at Hamlins, on behalf of the phone-hacking victims.\n\nThe allegations of Lewis\u2019s complicity in email deletion stand in contrast to the way his role in rooting out phone hacking was viewed by the journalists he was investigating at the time.\n\nIn January 2011, when Lewis found out about the imminent email deletions, he wrote to the company\u2019s chief lawyer to ensure that they were preserved.\n\nInformation provided by Lewis to the Metropolitan police during the hacking inquiry, including thousands of emails from Sun journalists, prompted the arrest of dozens of News International journalists.

He joined the British army in 2001 and has been continuously in the UK since being discharged from the military in 2011, living with his wife and three daughters and paying tax and national insurance.\n\nRatacaucau said: \u201cI never in a million years thought that the country I so proudly sacrificed my life for, almost died for, would turn around and leave one of its soldiers behind. I feel so betrayed.\u201d He said he and his family and his \u201cveteran brothers are asking the government to do the right thing\u201d.\n\nAnthony Metzer, QC, who is representing the group, said his clients were \u201cdeeply disappointed, though not wholly surprised, at what they consider to be a dismissive, arrogant and detached response.\n\n\u201cIn the circumstances, they have been left no recourse other than to proceed with their judicial review claim, which they had hoped might have been avoided if a sympathetic and understanding approach had been adopted,\u201d he said.\n\nMinistry of Defence rules state that Commonwealth-born service personnel are eligible for indefinite leave to remain in the UK after discharge if they have served four years. But the claimants say the army failed to tell them that, on discharge, they needed to make an immediate application to the Home Office for leave to remain in the UK, despite a clear MoD requirement that the process should be explained to all non-British veterans before they left.\n\nMost assumed that after four years of service the immigration process was automatic; the Home Office stamped their passports on joining the military with a note stating they were exempt from immigration restrictions, and that they were \u201cnot subject to any condition or limitation on the period of permitted stay in the UK\u201d. The stamps were not marked with an expiry date but nevertheless became invalid on discharge. Veterans say they were not informed.\n\nRatacaucau after surgery. \u2018I feel so betrayed,\u2019 he said.\n\nWith the introduction of the Home Office\u2019s \u201chostile environment\u201d policy after 2012 they discovered they were in breach of immigration rules. However, as Home Office visa application fees had risen sharply, from \u00a31,051 in 2015 to the current fee of \u00a32,389, they struggled to change their situation. The fees meant a service leaver and their partner, with two children, would have to pay nearly \u00a310,000 to stay in the UK, an unaffordable sum for most on army pensions.\n\nVinita Templeton, lawyer for the group who, like colleagues, has been working on the case on a pro-bono basis for more than a year, said the government\u2019s treatment of her clients had caused them \u201cunimaginable suffering\u201d. She said she and colleagues planned to proceed with legal action.\n\nJames Sunderland, a Conservative MP and former colonel who served with Ratacaucau in the Royal Logistic Corp in Germany, said he had been in touch with the legal team on Wednesday and would be following developments.\n\n\u201cI don\u2019t want to prejudice the legal process but my enduring view is that the British government could be doing more. We are all veterans together. If you are recruited, you wear the uniform and you serve the country. There should be no division in how you are treated as a veteran.\u201d\n\n\n\nSupport has poured in for Ratacaucau. Dr Hugh Milroy, the chief executive of Veterans Aid, said the organisation had long believed foreign and Commonwealth veterans had been treated unjustly.\n\n\u201cCommon humanity and natural justice suggest that there is something very wrong when a man who has served honourably in the British army for a decade is faced with a bill for medical treatment from the country for which he risked his life,\u201d he said.\n\nDan Jarvis, a former paratrooper, who is mayor of the Sheffield City Region, said the MoD should work with the Home Office to cancel Ratacaucau\u2019s debts and ensure Commonwealth veterans have the right to work in the UK and have free access to the NHS.\n\n\u201cHe risked his life while serving this country. No one who put their life on the line for us should be treated in this manner.\u201d\n\nEmma Norton, director of the Centre for Military Justice, a legal specialist, said Ratucaucau\u2019s case exposed contradictions in the treatment of veterans.\n\n\u201cThe government is keen to draw attention to its apparent support for the wider veteran community \u2013 apparently that only goes so far where it clashes with its hostile agenda towards migrant people.\u201d\n\nIn response to a request for comment, a government spokesperson said: \u201cWe cannot comment on the individual case because of ongoing legal proceedings.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Gentleman", "Dan Sabbagh"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2020/may/20/police-watchdog-announce-decision-boris-johnson-jennifer-arcuri-inquiry", "published": "2020-05-20T18:47:41", "title": "Police watchdog to announce decision on Johnson-Arcuri inquiry", "text": "Boris Johnson will find out on Thursday if he faces a criminal investigation into his relationship with an American businesswoman while he was mayor of London.\n\nThe Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) is to reveal its long-delayed decision on whether to investigate him for possible criminal misconduct over his friendship with Jennifer Arcuri.\n\nThe watchdog will make the announcement at noon, after spending months on a scoping exercise into whether the prime minister has a case to answer.\n\nJohnson was formally referred to the watchdog in September because he was the head of the mayor\u2019s office for policing and crime at a time when Arcuri received public money and access to trade trips led by Johnson when he was mayor. Arcuri was awarded thousands of pounds in public money, including \u00a311,500 by the mayor\u2019s promotional agency, London & Partners.\n\nJohnson\u2019s office also intervened to give her a place on trade missions to New York and Tel Aviv with Johnson, after she was initially turned down because she failed to meet the criteria.\n\nThe IOPC has repeatedly insisted that it has received no pressure from the government over the decision, which had been expected before last December\u2019s general election, or over its timing.\n\nThe watchdog has a duty to investigate any alleged criminal offence committed by a figure in charge of policing, whether or not they are still in office. That assessment has now concluded almost eight months after it was first referred to the IOPC.\n\nJohnson has insisted that he acted with \u201cfull propriety\u201d and claimed he had no interest to declare in Arcuri, who has said she was given no favours by Johnson. Arcuri has conceded, however, that the then mayor should have declared their friendship.\n\nIn response to a freedom of information request, the IOPC said earlier this month that it was still conducting its scoping exercise. In a letter to the social policy and transparency thinktank Society Syndrome, it said: \u201cWe are aware of the public interest in this matter and once a decision has been made, we will make a further statement.\u201d\n\nIt has strenuously denied delaying the decision to spare the prime minister potential embarrassment before the last election.\n\nThe watchdog is understood to have reached its decision believing that whichever way it goes, it may face a legal challenge, such as a judicial review, from those who disagree with it.\n\nIf it decides against a criminal investigation, it will not be the end of the matter.

If they come back with a negative conclusion [not to investigate], it comes back to the oversight committee. We will look at the evidence and come to a conclusion.\u201d\n\nThe oversight committee works to a lower standard of proof than the \u201cbeyond reasonable doubt\u201d threshold required for criminal action, but cannot apply any sanction other than a public report.\n\nEarlier this year, critics accused the IOPC of dragging its feet over the decision. Si\u00e2n Berry, the Green party co-leader who is standing as the Greens\u2019 candidate in next year\u2019s mayoral election, said in January: \u201cThis has gone on too long.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cThey should have made a decision before the general election.

Placing this ad directly before Joe\u2019s hugely popular children\u2019s daily PE class is a total betrayal of his work, and highly insensitive, irresponsible marketing.

That was a bridge too far for Thatcher. The cold war ends Collapse of Berlin wall and fall of communism in eastern Europe, which would later lead to expansion of EU.

But it could set him on a collision course with Brussels, which had envisaged that customs controls would apply to all goods entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain, with rebates on tariffs for goods that did not go on to the Republic of Ireland.\n\nSources say the government has come under pressure from big supermarket chains among other businesses who have argued that if they are delivering consignments to shoppers in Northern Ireland, a tariff-charge and charge-back arrangement would lead to costly and unnecessary paperwork.\n\nGove promised the checks would involve \u201cthe minimum possible bureaucratic consequences for business and traders, particularly those carrying out their affairs entirely within the UK customs territory\u201d.\n\nThe government has said, however, that \u201csome new administrative process\u201d will apply for traders because the deal requires the UK to apply EU customs rules to goods entering Northern Ireland. #\n\nThe DUP leader, Arlene Foster, welcomed the plan, revealing discussions on agrifood had been \u201cdifficult and sensitive\u201d. But she warned the UK deal must ensure it \u201cdoes not saddle individual Northern Ireland businesses with further costly administrative burdens\u201d.\n\nClaire Hanna, the Social Democratic and Labour party MP for Belfast South, said Gove had \u201cfinally confirmed there will be a large increase in the amount of red tape\u201d for businesses and warned that \u201ccastles in the air\u201d such as trade deals with the US would lead to increased checks in the Irish Sea.\n\nSinn F\u00e9in said the checks showed the \u201cforked tongue\u201d approach of the UK government.\n\nDiscussing the papers in the Commons, the shadow Cabinet Office minister, Rachel Reeves, said: \u201cWe welcome the statement today but it does expose the broken promises made by the prime minister ... Even now, many fear that the government are not willing to admit the full extent of those. We have seven months to get this right and we must.\u201d\n\nBusiness leaders also gave the plan a cautious welcome. Seamus Leheny, the policy manager at the Freight Transport Association in Northern Ireland, said it was a \u201cpositive step that the UK confirms there will be some controls\u201d, but that the language was so \u201cloose\u201d in areas that it was effectively putting the ball back in the EU\u2019s court.\n\nAodh\u00e1n Connolly, the director of the Northern Ireland Retail Consortium, said it was a good start but questions remained. \u201cThe UK government has acknowledged the need to deliver upon their obligations under the Northern Ireland protocol. This acceptance of the hurdles that need to be overcome is a good starting point, but there are still many questions that are left unanswered.\u201d\n\nAn EU spokesman said the commission welcomed the proposal and would study it in detail.\n\n\u201cWe have said we can provide certain flexibilities in terms of customs checks, but they have to fit with the union\u2019s customs code, because the Irish border is the EU border, so the union customs code applies,\u201d a second EU official said.\n\nThe document emerged as the EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier warned the government that the next round of negotiations on the future relationship must bring \u201cnew dynamism in order to avoid a stalemate\u201d. He was responding to a letter from his UK counterpart David Frost , who accused Brussels of treating the UK as an \u201cunworthy\u201d partner.\n\nFrost\u2019s letter went down badly in Brussels, where EU officials said it would have been better to save such conversations for the privacy of negotiations. In a pointed criticism made in his own reply - by letter - Barnier said an exchange of letters was \u201cnot necessarily the best way to discuss on substantial points\u201d.\n\nOne EU diplomat said Frost\u2019s letter was \u201cpetulant\u201d and \u201cnot helpful\u201d, although added some of Barnier\u2019s comments were \u201cnot very helpful either\u201d, referring to Barnier\u2019s recent remarks where he accused the UK of not engaging in the talks. \u201cWe would agree with [Barnier] in substance but we don\u2019t necessarily think that the tone of these comments has been very helpful,\u201d the diplomat said.\n\n\n\n", "author": ["Lisa O'Carroll", "Daniel Boffey", "Jennifer Rankin"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/uk-furniture-stores-to-reopen-in-time-for-bank-holiday-weekend", "published": "2020-05-20T19:50:39", "title": "UK furniture stores to reopen in time for bank holiday weekend", "text": "Furniture Village to open all outlets on Saturday while DFS will open some sites on Friday\n\nDFS and Furniture Village are to reopen outlets in time for the bank holiday weekend after the government cleared furniture stores to restart trade.\n\nFurniture Village will reopen all 46 branches on Saturday after testing physical distancing measures in six stores including Bristol, Gillingham, Tamworth and York over the past week.

As a side dish, it lets the flavours of the main dish shine through. It is rarely the principal attraction, but with a few extra ingredients \u2013 and these can be whatever you need to use up in your fridge \u2013 it is easily transformed from a reliable but uninspiring accompaniment into a satisfying meal.\n\nNow is a great time to experiment and there is much more you can do with rice than just boiling or frying it. Here are 17 tasty recipes to get you started.\n\nCongee\n\nFed up with oats for breakfast? Why not try congee, a silky smooth (usually savoury) porridge made from rice. Hugely popular in Asian countries, it is more labour intensive than regular porridge, but definitely worth the extra effort. What to Cook Today\u2019s basic congee recipe is simple: washed rice (any type works) is brought to the boil with lots of water and then simmered on medium heat until it\u2019s soft. If you have messed up the ratio, it is easy to correct. Too watery, let it cook for longer. Too thick, just add more water.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Congee. Photograph: Nora Carol Photography/Getty Images\n\nOnce you have mastered that, you can adapt it however you like. A stock cube is great for adding flavour or you could make your own broth. You can throw in any vegetables or meat you have to hand, while chopped ginger adds an extra kick. Artist Ai Weiwei eats his with pork, Chinese cabbage and fried mushrooms. If you want to use fish, Roti & Rice suggests adding this just a few minutes before the rice is ready.\n\nFinish with some soy sauce, a scattering of spring onion and a dash of sesame oil once it\u2019s done. Congee is also a great option if you\u2019re feeling unwell \u2013 it is the ultimate comfort food.\n\nOne pot rice\n\nOne of the easiest ways to make a delicious meal with maximum taste and minimum washing up is to put everything into one pot. RecipeTin Eats\u2019 juicy Chinese chicken and rice is easily adaptable \u2013 you can use prawns or mince meat instead \u2013 and if you don\u2019t have Asian greens such as choi sum or pak choi, swap them for any other vegetables you have. Sear the marinated chicken in the same pot if you can so the rice can absorb the browning that\u2019s left at the bottom. Any kind of brown or white rice can be used, apart from paella and risotto.\n\nSimilarly, Yotam Ottolenghi\u2019s wonderful lamb pilaf with sweet almonds is made with basmati rice and calls for Iranian dried sour plums, which can be found in most Middle Eastern supermarkets. These can also be substituted for dried apricots. BBC Good Food\u2019s spiced vegetable biryani, a rich and fiery dish cooked with cauliflower, sweet potato, onion and green beans, also uses basmati. Serve with some poppadoms, chutney and raita.\n\nFried rice\n\nFried rice is quick, easy and a great way to use up any leftover rice, although freshly made rice will work at a push. Just spread it out on a plate for a few minutes while it\u2019s hot to let some of the moisture evaporate. Medium to long grain is best. The key to getting a gratifying crunch to your fried rice is to use lots of oil and to stir well while cooking to make sure each grain is coated.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Felicity Cloake\u2019s perfect nasi goreng. Photograph: The Guardian. Food styling: Liam Baker.\n\nHanna Chia\u2019s kale and shiitake mushroom fried rice is simple and takes only 10 minutes to rustle up. Other types of mushroom can be used if you don\u2019t have shiitake. The Omnivore\u2019s Cookbook\u2019s classic egg fried rice recipe, which only requires a few ingredients, will satisfy any hankerings for a Chinese takeaway. Add soy sauce instead of salt for some extra flavour. If it\u2019s Indonesian cuisine you\u2019re after, Felicity Cloake\u2019s nasi goreng made with jasmine rice is spicy and delectable. Don\u2019t forget to top it off with a fried egg.\n\nRisotto\n\nA creamy risotto with lashings of butter and parmesan never fails to feel indulgent. If you have arborio or carnaroli rice at home, you can easily have dinner on the table in 30 minutes. One of the most crucial steps in making risotto is to make sure the grains are lightly toasted for a few minutes in hot oil or butter before you add in the stock. Whenever I\u2019ve forgotten to do this, I\u2019ve ended up with risotto that hasn\u2019t softened sufficiently after the required cooking time.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Risotto with asparagus, parsley and peas. Photograph: etorres69/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nRachel Roddy\u2019s hopeful spring risotto is a great way to use up frozen peas, although it can also be cooked with broad beans. If you\u2019re put off by all the stirring involved, then why not give Cloake\u2019s fail-safe no-stir recipe a whirl? Even better, Anna Jones\u2019s squash risotto (I use butternut squash) is baked in the oven, with minimal stirring involved.\n\nTo make a risotto recipe vegan, replace the butter with olive oil and use nutritional yeast instead of cheese. Or, if you end up with some celeriac in your veg box, try Meera Sodha\u2019s risotto with sage, caper and lemon oil.\n\nStuffed vegetables\n\nPlump stuffed tomatoes are a popular Mediterranean dish that will bring back many sunny holiday memories. Crete Gazette\u2019s Greek version, known as gemista, can also be applied to peppers. Hollow out tomatoes, reserving the flesh. Then fry some garlic and onion with the tomato pulp, before adding long grain rice along with dill, salt and pepper. Don\u2019t cook the rice completely as it will finish cooking in the oven. Use the mixture to stuff the empty shells, then bake until the tomatoes are tender and the rice is done. Any leftovers will taste even better the next day.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Baked stuffed tomatoes. Photograph: IngaNielsen/Getty Images/iStockphoto\n\nCourgettes are also delicious when stuffed with rice and minced meat. To hollow them out, use an apple corer. If you don\u2019t have one, scoop out the pulp with a slim serrated knife. Roddy\u2019s stuffed courgette recipe, which uses parsley, mint and lemon juice, is a vibrant mixture of Italian and Middle Eastern cooking. Eat it with bread so you can mop up every last bit of the sauce.\n\nRice pudding\n\nFor those with a sweet tooth, rice is heavenly when served as dessert and rice pudding is an old-fashioned classic. Ideally, use pudding rice but you can get away with using other types of rice such as sushi, arborio or even basmati. Combine with sugar, add evaporated milk and whole milk, grate nutmeg, and dot butter on top before bunging it in the oven. Delia Smith\u2019s recipe is super easy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rice pudding.

Some said they were struggling to pay for essentials.\n\nOne health care assistant, Folasade, 47, originally from Nigeria, said that her work on night shifts in a Midlands hospital was \u201creally hard but I enjoy helping people.\u201d\n\nFolasade, who has been in the UK for ten years next month, went on: \u201cI have two children and with the NHS fees and the Home Office visa fees together it\u2019s difficult to find the money. It\u2019s a struggle to pay my rent and I\u2019ve never had a holiday. I pay \u00a3500 every month towards my debts for previous fees and next year I have to pay another set. I don\u2019t know yet how I will pay them.\u201d\n\nThe surcharge has become a heated political issue since the coronavirus crisis began, with politicians and health bodies urging the government to scrap it for migrant care workers after it was paused for a year for doctors, nurses and paramedics.\n\nThe NHS fee of \u00a3400 a year for migrant care workers coming from outside the European Economic Area is paid regardless of use of healthcare services. It is rising in October to \u00a3624 a year.\n\nQuick guide The immigration health surcharge Show Hide What is it? Any worker who comes to the UK from outside the European Economic Area pays the fee to use the health service. The surcharge costs \u00a3300 a year for student visas and \u00a3400 a year for all other visa and immigration applications. It is set to rise in October. A migrant\u2019s dependants usually need to pay the same amounts. Who does not need to pay? You don\u2019t pay this fee if you are applying for indefinite leave to enter or remain, or if you are a diplomat or member of a visiting armed forces. Other exemptions include a dependant of a member of the UK\u2019s armed forces and a family member of a European national, as well as asylum seekers and victims of slavery or human trafficking.\n\nOn top of these charges, a migrant worker on a ten year pathway to citizenship will pay visa fees every two and a half years to allow them to keep working. These are currently \u00a31033. After three sets of fees, the worker pays for indefinite leave to remain, at the end of ten years for a further \u00a32,389. The costs are far higher than in other European countries.\n\nThe charity Migrant Voice said that between the NHS surcharge and the visa fees a family of four would pay \u00a350,000 over a decade.\n\nOne care home manager said she worked over 300 hours a month in a senior role, doing overtime to help pay her bills and childcare for her six year old. Another junior doctor said they had to take out loans to afford the charges, which left them struggling financially.\n\nJeri Lee, a 38-year-old care home manager from Jamaica, said: \u201cThere is a lot of diversity in my company, most staff are from the Caribbean, Africa or Europe, only a small number are British.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m on a ten year path to UK citizenship, I just paid my third set of fees,\u201d she said. \u201cI was very worried during the Covid peak about becoming ill and not being able to work. My immigration status means I have no access to public funds and wouldn\u2019t have got any benefits if I was sick.\u201d\n\nLee works over 300 hours a month in a senior role, doing overtime to help pay her bills and childcare for her six year old as well as the Home Office fees.\n\n\u201cI pay \u00a3700 hundred pounds a month in tax and then I have to pay this crazy NHS charge. It\u2019s really taking a toll on me, I work so many hours I don\u2019t get much time with my child,\u201d she said.\n\nJunior doctor, Aqsa Ghazanfar, described the expenses she has to pay as insulting. \u201cFrankly I mean myself and lots of my colleagues discussed it and feel insulted,\u201d she said. \u201cWe are putting our lives and our family\u2019s lives at risk and none of us have said we are not going to do this job. I am exposing myself to patients who potentially have Covid and bringing it home.\u201d\n\nShe added: \u201cIt is even more insulting [at the moment] - that is the only word I have really. It is appalling that people are still being asked to pay it.\u201d\n\nShe said that she had to take a loan every time to pay for her family\u2019s visa, as there is \u201cno way that I can pay that much\u201d.\n\nDame Donna Kinnair, chief executive and general secretary of the Royal College of Nursing (RCN), said: \u201cThe immigration health surcharge is a grossly unfair financial burden \u2026 The government must drop this charge as a matter of urgency.\u201d\n\nMigrant Voice director, Nazek Ramadan, said: \u201cAn average family of four now has to pay nearly \u00a350,000 over the 10 years from arriving in the UK to getting citizenship.\n\n\u201cOrdinary families are being stripped bare.

It tells the story of Jesse Dufton, a climber with a degenerative eye condition that has left him with almost no sight. Three years ago, he says, he thought he might have to give up \u201clead\u201d climbing (for outsiders like me, that\u2019s going up first) completely. But with the help of his fiancee Molly and his own determination, he set himself a challenge instead. He intends to become the first blind climber to lead on the Old Man of Hoy, a gorgeous, imposing 450ft seastack in Orkney.\n\nThis is a film made by, and largely for, climbing enthusiasts, though it does the casual non-climbing viewer the courtesy of explaining everything that needs to be explained. Director Alastair Lee has made plenty of climbing films before and his wealth of experience shows. He is present in the story, because he has to be \u2013 to film a climb means being on the climb.\n\nHowever, the story is very much Dufton\u2019s. He tells Lee that his vision has gone to such an extent that he cannot see his hand in front of his face unless he waves it around. This makes climbing a very different endeavour for him. He can\u2019t see where he should be putting his hands or his feet, or his equipment, and has to use a combination of touch and verbal guidance from Molly. \u201cI\u2019m not really using my eyes, to be honest,\u201d he says, which is all the more astonishing when the camera cuts away to the enormous drops beneath him.\n\nThe intricacies of what it means to climb without sight and how that can be possible are truly fascinating. As Dufton spends so much time searching for holds by touch, it usually takes him three or four times as long as it might take a sighted climber. Other climbers talk about what he does with incredulity; after attempting to boulder with a blindfold on, one even admits to Dufton that he\u2019s wondering why he wants to do it at all. \u201cYou don\u2019t get the satisfaction when there\u2019s no chance of failure,\u201d says Dufton, even though the failure in question is potentially very grave indeed.\n\nBut this is a story of triumph. There\u2019s little sentimentality here, only no-nonsense dedication to achieving what many would deem to be impossible. Dufton\u2019s parents are a treat, giggling as they admit that they saw him bumping into things as a child: \u201cWe just thought, well, he\u2019s not looking where he\u2019s going.\u201d When Molly tells the story of her partner\u2019s proposal, on a mountaintop in Greenland, she says, simply: \u201cObviously I said yes.\u201d Their relationship is a marvel to watch, whether she is describing a narrow grassy path, hanging perilously close to a sheer drop into the sea in order for him to navigate it, or offering encouragement as he twists his way up under a particularly awkward rock.\n\nThere is so much action that there is little room for contemplation, but when it comes, it is touching. Dufton says he can remember Molly\u2019s face as it was when they first met and he still had some of his sight. He says the one thing he would like back is the ability to see it again. There is some discussion about the possibility of him one day being able to see again, should scientific research get to that point, but there is also thoughtful discussion about what that would mean.

In fact we haven\u2019t seen him at all; not even for a single Downing Street press conference. Far too much like hard work. He\u2019s even making the notoriously lazy David Cameron look industrious by comparison. And Dave wasn\u2019t prime minister during the worst global health crisis in 100 years.\n\nNow, though, things have become a little clearer. In between taking Dilyn for a walk in the park and avoiding changing his baby\u2019s nappies, Boris has been breaking the habit of a lifetime by actually doing some preparation. After two weeks of humiliation at the despatch box during prime minister\u2019s questions, Boris had been taking lessons in how not to appear like a total car crash in front of a top QC.\n\nQ&A What is contact tracing? Show Hide Contact tracing is one of the most basic planks of public health responses to a pandemic like the coronavirus. It means literally tracking down anyone that somebody with an infection may have had contact with in the days before they became ill. It was \u2013 and always will be \u2013 central to the fight against Ebola, for instance. In west Africa in 2014-15, there were large teams of people who would trace relatives and knock on the doors of neighbours and friends to find anyone who might have become infected by touching the sick person. Most people who get Covid-19 will be infected by their friends, neighbours, family or work colleagues, so they will be first on the list. It is not likely anyone will get infected by someone they do not know, passing on the street. It is still assumed there has to be reasonable exposure \u2013 originally experts said people would need to be together for 15 minutes, less than 2 metres apart. So a contact tracer will want to know who the person testing positive met and talked to over the two or three days before they developed symptoms and went into isolation. South Korea has large teams of contact tracers and notably chased down all the contacts of a religious group, many of whose members fell ill. That outbreak was efficiently stamped out by contact tracing and quarantine. Singapore and Hong Kong have also espoused testing and contact tracing and so has Germany. All those countries have had relatively low death rates so far. The World Health Organization says it should be the \u201cbackbone of the response\u201d in every country. Sarah Boseley Health editor\n\nThe message that Boris appeared to have been given was for him to be more himself. The downside to this, though, is that the real Boris is actually rather unpleasant. The popular, fun-loving image has only ever been a veneer. Deep down, Boris is needy and insecure. Character traits that he hates in himself and finds impossible to accept, so his first instinct when cornered is to lash out. So that was the Boris we got at this week\u2019s PMQs. Pugnacious, ungracious, blustering, and not totally coherent.\n\nFor the extra Tory backbenchers who had been bussed in for the occasion \u2013 the party high command feel Boris performs best when there is a home audience \u2013 this was an undoubted improvement on what had gone before when only a surly incompetence had been on view. But it was still a long way short of what most people in the country would have wanted from their leader at such a time. Even when he is being himself, Boris just isn\u2019t that good when up against someone like Keir Starmer, who is used to building a case based on the evidence.\n\nThe Labour leader began on care homes. How did the government square its insistence that it had \u201cthrown a protective ring around care homes\u201d with the evidence given to the health select committee by the chief executive of Care England that countless patients had been booted out of hospital without any testing for the coronavirus?\n\n\u201cAs he knows full well, er, the, er, dist \u2026 \u201d Boris began, struggling to complete a meaningful sentence. We never did get to find out what the \u201cdist\u201d was. His language was as much of a mess as his hair. But just as it seemed the prime minister was reverting to one of his other default settings of winging it, he glanced at his notes for a better line of attack.\n\nAha, he said. No one had been released into care homes without a clinician signing them out. Here we got a first view of the government\u2019s defence in the coming public inquiry. The government had never intended the wrong people to be released from hospitals and if they had been, then it was all down to doctor error. In five years\u2019 time it will turn out that all the excess care home deaths were down to one doctor who has also conveniently died of the coronavirus, and nothing to do with any decisions the government had made.\n\nThere were times during the following exchanges when Starmer appeared rather unsettled by this new bullish, sollipsistic Boris \u2013 it was the height of cheek to accuse Starmer of feigning ignorance, when the prime minister was so busy feigning intelligence. At one point Matt Hancock started joining in \u2013 \u201cand you bought your mum a \u00a310m donkey sanctuary, so there\u201d \u2013 before the Speaker invited him to either shut up or sod off. Matt slumped into a five-year-old\u2019s strop and stared angrily at the ground.\n\nNot that Boris appeared particularly grateful for the health secretary\u2019s intervention \u2013 he dislikes toadies as much as those who stand up to him \u2013 as he promptly threw him under a bus by insisting that the test and trace programme would be fully operational by 1 June. There was no word on whether Matt\u2019s App would also be up and running, but given that the government has missed almost every deadline it has set for itself \u2013 and lied about the ones it has met \u2013 no one was holding their breath. Boris had yet again set himself and his health secretary up to fail.\n\nAlthough Starmer wasn\u2019t getting things all his own way, there was no doubt he was still getting the better of every argument. There\u2019s something about the poise and command of the Labour leader that seems to get under the prime minister\u2019s skin. As if he knows that he will never come close to having his integrity or intellect. At one point Boris nearly lost it completely by demanding that Keir stop being so negative. How about some applause for the people who hadn\u2019t died?\n\n\u201cI\u2019m sorry, but 34,000 dead is negative,\u201d Starmer observed. Especially as the real figure was north of 50,000, many of which were totally avoidable.\n\nOne could forgive a lot if Boris was even able to come close to an apology, but now he can\u2019t even admit that there is a correlation between an effective test-and-trace system and a further easing of lockdown measures. There again, he can\u2019t bring himself to say how many children he has, so what hope is there?\n\nIt was with the last two questions that Starmer left Boris hopelessly exposed. How did the government justify the \u00a3654 visa surcharge on so many overseas workers who had done so much to keep the NHS running more or less smoothly?\n\nBoris merely shrugged. They were a useful source of revenue. Besides, they were lucky to have a job in which some of them could say they had been able to save the life of the prime minister. Put that way, Luis and Jenny should have been thanking him for fleecing them for more cash rather than the other way round. Such is his narcissism, Boris had no idea how petty and spiteful he sounded.\n\nThe rest of PMQs was something of a non-event. Boris had clearly come prepared to see off Keir and only had bog-standard, drivel-strewn non-answers for everyone else. He left the chamber with a swagger. Before he had twice lost on a knockout; now he had just been comprehensively outclassed on points. And back in Downing Street, Classic Dom would be telling him that was another overwhelming victory.", "author": ["John Crace"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/business/2020/may/20/we-missed-the-sweet-and-sour-sauce-joy-as-mcdonalds-drive-throughs-reopen", "published": "2020-05-20T15:22:40", "title": "'We missed the sweet and sour sauce': joy as McDonald's drive-throughs reopen", "text": "Word spread fast that the McDonald\u2019s drive-through at Bushey, near Watford in Hertfordshire, was on the list of Golden Arches restaurants that had reopened after eight weeks, and the queue of customers craving Big Macs and Happy Meals began building rapidly. By 1pm, two hours after it reopened, a line of about 40 vehicles meant an hour-long roadside wait for burger fans.\n\nThe branch is among 33 outlets the fast food chain has reopened for drive-through only in London and south-east England as it eases back into business following the loosening of lockdown restrictions.\n\nMcDonald\u2019s and other fast food chains including Burger King, KFC and Nando\u2019s are trialling a gradual reopening of restaurants to allow staff to get used to new safety measures and practise physical distancing inside.\n\nIn Bushey, sisters Casey and Alycia Levy, aged 18 and 20, had bought burgers, chicken nuggets and cold drinks as a surprise for their grandparents, who have been isolating for 11 weeks. \u201cThey\u2019ve been at home since 1 March, so we wanted to cheer them up,\u201d Alycia said.\n\nMatthew Cohen had brought his children Dylan, 7, and Summer, 11, for lunch. \u201cWe\u2019ve been missing the sweet and sour sauce with our chicken nuggets,\u201d Cohen said.\n\n\n\nThe family usually visit the drive-through weekly, and had a longer wait than usual, because only one lane was open, but did not find a radical change in the experience.\n\nPlay Video 0:59 Hour-long queues as McDonald's reopens drive-through restaurants \u2013 video\n\nThe changes in restaurant operations will be more noticeable for the staff. They now have their temperatures checked when they arrive for a shift, and will be given protective equipment including masks and gloves. They are also protected from customers by perspex screens installed at the drive-through windows, and from their fellow workers inside the restaurant\u2019s kitchen.\n\nAs a McDonald\u2019s employee \u2013 his face covered with a face mask and wearing a hi-vis vest \u2013 marshalled the queue of cars, other staff members walked the line of vehicles to tell customers they were serving only a limited menu. Clients were asked to use contactless payment methods if possible and spending was capped at \u00a325 per vehicle.\n\nThe details of which branches were reopening were kept secret until just 45 minutes before the first customers were served, as McDonald\u2019s tried to avoid a rerun of its experience in France and Switzerland. When drive-throughs were reopened there, the first locations were announced well in advance, leading to queues of up to seven hours.\n\nMany customers at Bushey had heard about the reopening on social media and had brought their children for a trip out to buy a meal.\n\nBy lunchtime, so many vehicles were queueing for the Bushey branch that they were starting to disrupt traffic on the adjoining A41, and the restaurant\u2019s franchise owner and some of his staff enlisted the help of a nearby highway maintenance crew to cordon off part of the road, creating a one-way system.\n\nDespite almost two months passing since the government introduced lockdown measures and the closure of seating spaces in all restaurants, some customers were still unsure how to behave. Having ordered burgers from their car window, one mother and son were disappointed not to be able to eat their lunch at a sunny table outside.\n\nThe fast food chain said it had informed police forces, local authorities and the highways agency in all places where it was due to reopen. At one restaurant, in Peterborough, a police officer called in to check that the agreed vehicle queueing system was in place and that no further crowd control measures were required.", "author": ["Joanna Partridge"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/music/2020/may/20/joni-mitchell-where-to-start-in-her-back-catalogue", "published": "2020-05-20T15:00:28", "title": "Joni Mitchell: where to start in her back catalogue", "text": "In Listener\u2019s digest, our writers help you explore the work of great musicians. Next up: the poet of Laurel Canyon who refused anyone\u2019s will but her own\n\nThe album to start with\n\nBlue (1971)\n\nBy the time Joni Mitchell released Blue in 1971, she had survived polio, a divorce, put her baby up for adoption, fended off another marriage proposal (from Graham Nash), and watched as one of her songs, Both Sides Now, became a massive hit for someone else. She had, in short, seen a lot in her 27 years.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joni Mitchell: A Case of You \u2013 video\n\nMitchell has told of the power of her fourth record better than anyone else ever could hope to. \u201cThe Blue album, there\u2019s hardly a dishonest note in the vocals,\u201d she told Rolling Stone in 1979. \u201cAt that period in my life, I had no personal defences. I felt like a cellophane wrapper on a pack of cigarettes. I felt like I had absolutely no secrets from the world and I couldn\u2019t pretend in my life to be strong. Or to be happy. But the advantage of it in the music was that there were no defences there either.\u201d\n\nThere is not one single track on this album that is not magnificent. And it was an audacious record in many ways. The emotional life of a young woman had never been put to tape so nakedly and so unapologetically \u2013 from the wretchedness of giving up a child (Little Green), the mocking of men who laugh at the follies of young women who want \u201croses and kisses and pretty men to tell you all those pretty lies\u201d and end up a wife with a coffee percolator (The Last Time I Saw Richard), and trying to find emancipation in love affairs (\u201cI love you when I forget about me\u201d, on All I Want).\n\nThe music is as bold as its subject matter. Her hands damaged with polio, she made up her own guitar tunings. Her soprano, borrowing often from jazz phrasing, is thrillingly alive; there is no resolution with a neat pop harmony. Listen, and you have your own secret desires articulated.\n\nThe characters within the songs are vivid and complex. Take A Case of You, a love song written in the past tense, a dialogue with her former lover Leonard Cohen. It opens with the line stolen from Cohen, who was quoting Julius Caesar at her. He was mad she had used their private conversation in song. \u201cLife is fair game\u201d for lyrics, she said. She drinks up a lover in full, and emerges from the relationship clear-headed, still standing.\n\nThe weight of the public consumption of her inner life, and those of the other singer-songwriters from the Laurel Canyon scene, would be hard for her to bear at times. But in spearheading music that looked towards the emotional life of its makers, she created an enduring bond with her listeners.\n\nThe three albums to listen to next\n\nFor the Roses (1972)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joni Mitchell: You Turn Me On, I\u2019m a Radio \u2013 video\n\nAfter the exposure of those cellophane years, Mitchell sought retreat. She went back home to Canada, and bought a tiny stone house \u201clike a monastery\u201d on British Columbia\u2019s Sunshine Coast where she could hide from it all. There was no electricity; by night she lived by candlelight. By day, she bathed under the old trees, in the waterfalls, on the pebble beaches. She wrote an album about salvation, about finding oneself again in the silence after the applause has finished.\n\nJudgement of the Moon and Stars is her grand tribute to Beethoven, about whom she read a book in her isolation. She felt kinship with him \u2013 rejected by the court, too wild for the refined world in which he was forced to play. Mitchell was fully aware of her own genius \u2013 the critics would never compare her to the great masters, so she did it herself.\n\nHer voice on this album rings with clarity. Cold Blue Steel and Sweet Fire is a devastating account of her relationship with James Taylor, her torment at watching him succumb to the \u201cshadow of lady release\u201d, or heroin. There are no holds barred \u2013 the sink is splattered with blood, the protagonist \u201cbashes in veins for peace\u201d. We so often look to the Velvet Underground\u2019s Heroin or Neil Young\u2019s The Needle and the Damage Done as cultural documents of the desolation and helplessness of opiate addiction, but Mitchell\u2019s despair is incomparable in its precision.\n\nYou Turn Me on, I\u2019m a Radio was Mitchell\u2019s cheeky response when her new record label boss, David Geffen, asked her to write a hit (which it was). But the rest of the album is harder, more exhausting than Blue. Perhaps that is something to do with the glorious, golden timbre of her voice. A Woman of Heart and Mind vibrates with these chestier, lower tones she adopts. She is confrontational on this song, her equivalent perhaps of Virginia Wolf\u2019s A Room of One\u2019s Own in its manifesto-like defiance to protect her own freedom.\n\nThe song Lesson in Survival could well have been the title of the album \u2013 one that deals with the capacity of the natural world to heal and rebuild, the benefits of solitude, stillness and isolation on the psyche. Never has this been more prescient than now.\n\nCourt and Spark (1974)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joni Mitchell: Free Man in Paris \u2013 video\n\nAfter the releases of For the Roses, Geffen \u2013 who by this point had acquired a Hollywood mansion \u2013 lured her back to stay with him (and Cher, who he was living with at the time). She had gone in search of meaning and came back to the glitz and pomp and bright lights of the Los Angeles party scene. This would become her muse: a human circus of hot messes. And while she writes as one of them, she is still a Canadian prairie girl at heart. This tension is the core of this record, and it is also, as Brian Eno has pointed out, a pop album that deals not with the complexities of adolescence but adulthood.\n\nThere are familiar themes though: sexual liberation, such as on Help Me, a gorgeous, lilting, jazz ballad said to be about her dalliance with Warren Beatty (Prince would quote it years later on the lusty groove of The Ballad of Dorothy Parker). Free Man in Paris, inspired by a trip she took with Geffen, is a song, in Mitchell\u2019s words, about the unequivocal joy of feeling \u201cunfettered and alive\u201d. Geffen at the time was 20 years away from publicly coming out, and he begged her not to put it on the album for fear of the protagonist looking for \u201cthat very good friend of mine\u201d would out him. But the song stayed, and it lives on as a testament to the lightness of being that comes with expressing one\u2019s sexual self.\n\nPeople\u2019s Parties, meanwhile, is such a shrewd dismantling of the myth of celebrity that the lyrics read like a news dispatch from a far-flung country, except she is at a party in the Hollywood hills. \u201cSome are friendly,\u201d she writes of her fellow guests. \u201cSome are cutting, some are watching it from the wings. Some are standing in the centre, giving to get something.\u201d\n\nHejira (1976)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joni Mitchell: Coyote \u2013 video\n\nOf all the things her fans have said to her over the years, it was a young woman who turned to her once backstage at the Grammys and said: \u201cGirl, you make me see pictures in my head\u201d that thrilled her the most. Hejira, in that respect, is a cinema screen in Technicolor.\n\nBy March 1976, Mitchell was enveloped by a cocaine addiction, cancelled a tour, and left LA with an ex lover and a potential new lover to drive to Maine, deviating via the deep south. The opening track, Coyote, tremors with the thrill of such a journey, the pulsating of the light and dark of the freeway. We meet the album\u2019s characters: the lovers, the \u201ccoyotes\u201d who she picks up dancing in bars, who \u201cpicks up my scent on his fingers\u201d the next morning \u201cwhile he\u2019s watching the waitresses\u2019 legs\u201d in some diner. There is no shame in it. \u201cNo regrets, coyote,\u201d is the first line of the album.\n\nHejira is about fight and flight. She is here, ostensibly, \u201cwrestling with my ego\u201d, trying to let go of the self-absorption that comes with cocaine. Never is this more present than in Song for Sharon, in which she dedicates a verse to the suicide of Phyllis Major, the wife of Mitchell\u2019s former lover Jackson Browne, with whom she had a stormy relationship. The grief was for the sisterhood; she blamed herself for not warning the women who came after her. \u201cIt seems we all live so close to that line, and so far from satisfaction,\u201d she sang.\n\nCasual encounters, with their fleeting moments of ecstasy and liberation, offered no less. \u201cThere\u2019s no comprehending, just how close to the bone and the skin and the eyes and the lips you can get and still feel so alone,\u201d she sings, on Coyote again. It is not self-pitying, but a realist\u2019s account of wanting human touch without attachment, and the inevitable consequences.\n\nMitchell\u2019s vulnerability is not the gentle, fragile kind that women are expected to display \u2013 it is at times annihilating. She demands the freedoms afforded to men to be left alone to do whatever they want, but Refuge of the Roads seems to laugh all this off. Keep moving, keep growing, it says: \u201cWe laughed how our perfection, would always be denied.\u201d\n\nOne for the heads\n\nMingus (1979)\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Joni Mitchell: The Wolf That Lives in Lindsey \u2013 video\n\nCharles Mingus was one of the most lauded bassists and bandleaders in jazz, playing behind Charlie Parker, Duke Ellington and Louis Armstrong. He was explosive, at times violent, a \u201cbad boy offstage\u201d but \u201cpure as could be onstage\u201d as Mitchell would describe him. Mingus would chastise players for falsifying emotion \u2013 \u201cmost people can\u2019t hear that, the phony note,\u201d she told her biographer David Yaffe \u2013 but he liked Mitchell for her purity of spirit and lack of guile.\n\nBy the time they worked together, Mingus had been diagnosed with Lou Gehrig\u2019s disease and was terminally ill. He died before the project could be completed. \u201cCharles Mingus, a musical mystic, died in Mexico, January 5, 1979 at the age of 56. He was cremated the next day. That same day 56 sperm whales beached themselves on the Mexican coastline and were removed by fire. These are the coincidences that thrill my imagination,\u201d she wrote in the sleevenotes.\n\nWhile she had never put her voice to someone else\u2019s music before, the album is all the more thrilling because of it \u2013 it howls with this collision of euphoria and dissonance. Her voice, in part due to the steady stream of cigarettes she smoked, is deeper than the flighty soprano of her younger years, rich and world-worn. She is facing her own mortality as Mingus grapples with his.\n\nInstinct drives this album much like the rest of Mitchell\u2019s career. An easy path for her could well have been to write album after album of Blues and Court and Sparks, but she would never have found satisfaction. Her endurance has been down to her own strong will \u2013 never has she settled into taking the advice of others. That is true resilience, a rare freedom of spirit.\n\nTurbulent indigos: glorious Joni Mitchell watercolours \u2013 in pictures Read more\n\nThe primer playlist\n\nFor Spotify users, click here or see below.\n\nFurther reading\n\nReckless Daughter by David Yaffe\n\nA comprehensive, meticulously researched biography featuring many interviews over the years with Mitchell herself and her collaborators.

Enter the forest mobile-forest soundscape-forest-desktop-FINAL Dawn As we wake up to an early start around sunrise, many birds are already up and singing at full throat to stake off their territory and attract potential mates. The nightingale likes to hide in thick brush when delivering its powerful song. It can be heard between April and June and is most active at dawn and dusk. The robin is a pugnacious little bird that will try to maintain its territory throughout the year. Fallow deer often stalk the forest at dawn before lying down to ruminate during the day. They give off powerful bellows to establish dominance or signal alarm. Noon Around midday, the forest gets quieter as birds and other small animals are cautious not to attract the attention of predators. But not all animals fall silent \u2026 The woodpecker\u2019s distinctive drumming can often be heard during the day. The woodpecker uses its drumming like other birds use their song: to attract mates, defend a territory or summon help. The great tit is known for its vast repertoire of short calls. The grey squirrel spends much of the day scavenging for nuts, fruit and fungi. It will give off loud alarm calls when spotting a predator. Dusk As the sun goes down, more animals can be heard stirring in the undergrowth again. The red fox is an extremely adaptive species not afraid of exploring gardens or farmland. Its diet includes rodents, insects, fruit and vegetables \u2013 and sometimes scraps found in the garbage. The elusive pine marten is a close relative of the weasel and critically endangered in England and Wales. It is a stealthy, acrobatic hunter that likes to venture out at dusk. The mole is active for about four hours at a time and then rests for a similar amount of time. It makes shrill chirping noises when alarmed. Night Many animals awake only after nightfall to move or hunt under cover of darkness. The badger emerges from its underground home after dusk to feed on worms, birds\u2019 eggs or small animals. It is a highly social animal and communicates through chortling sounds. The tawny owl glides almost soundlessly through the night as it looks for prey. The male gives off an eerie hoot when attempting to court a nearby female. Finally, we hear a hedgehog snuffling as it moves through the undergrowth. The hedgehog can also become surprisingly noisy during its lengthy mating ritual.\n\nIf you enjoyed this interactive, you might find that some of these animals live right on your doorstep.\n\nIf you decide to exercise outdoors, remember that the government\u2019s coronavirus advice is to stay at home as much as possible.

Photograph: SonySony/Everett/Rex\n\nJones \u2013 perhaps a little disingenuously but charmingly so \u2013 says he\u2019s not a big comics fan, while in the next breath describing a childhood spent reading The Trigan Empire, Marvel and DC comics, and his dad giving him graphic novels such as Black Hole by Charles Burns, Maus and When the Wind Blows (for whose animated version Bowie provided the title track). How is he not a comics fan? \u201cI say that to be respectful of those people out there who truly are,\u201d he says.\n\nMadi, subtitled Once Upon a Time in the Future, is set in the \u201cMooniverse\u201d, the same near-future reality as Moon and Mute, but none of the stories are directly linked. Jones refers to the three stories as his \u201csalty Cornetto trilogy\u201d, a reference to Edgar Wright and Simon Pegg\u2019s \u201cThree Flavours Cornetto trilogy\u201d made up of Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, and The World\u2019s End.\n\nMadi follows the title character, who is one of many enhanced ex-military personnel who have become indentured to the giant private corporations that run the world, working as mercenaries in order to pay for the technology that was put into their bodies during their years of service. Madi finally has enough and, after a bad final job, goes on the run.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Mooniversal story \u2026 a page from Madi. Illustration: Z2 Comics\n\nA year ago, Jones asked his 350,000 Twitter followers to recommend the best comics artists to bring his vision to life. Having assembled a roster of possible candidates, Jones needed someone who could help him adapt his movie into a comic. That led him to \u201cmy Sherpa, my Yoda, my guru\u201d, the comic writer and novelist Alex de Campi.\n\nIt was De Campi\u2019s idea to have more than one artist illustrate what turned out to be a 260-page graphic novel, splitting it between the talent that Jones had been wowed by on Twitter. \u201cI\u2019ve got a lot of work and made a lot of great connections via social media but this is by far the best,\u201d she says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t so much a vote thing or an internet popularity contest, but I think a few big industry friends weighed in privately to Duncan to say \u2018she\u2019s all right\u2019 when I responded to his callout.\u201d\n\nIt took De Campi two months to adapt the script, sending it to Jones in 10-page batches. \u201cDuncan over in LA would review the pages and tweak things and we pretty much had a constant back and forth about the script as we went,\u201d De Campi says. \u201cThe adaptation happened very fast, because the faster I had a script ready, the more time artists had to draw.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Many hands \u2026 a page from Madi. Illustration: Z2 Comics\n\nThe artists behind Madi are a who\u2019s who of comic talent, comprising Dylan Teague, Glenn Fabry, Duncan Fegredo, LRNZ, Ed Oca\u00f1a, Andr\u00e9 Ara\u00fajo, Simon Bisley, Rosemary Valero-O\u2019Connell, Ton\u010di Zonji\u0107, Pia Guerra, James Stokoe, RM Gu\u00e9ra, Chris Weston, Rufus Dayglo, Annie Wu, David L\u00f3pez and Christian Ward, with covers by Duncan Fegredo and Yuko Shimizu.\n\nOn Tuesday, Jones and De Campi launched a Kickstarter to raise \u00a340,000 to fund the project; within hours, it reached \u00a3125,000. Madi will be released in a variety of hard-copy formats \u2013 not digitally \u2013 in November, with the first 19 pages already available online.\n\nAre either of them afraid that film or Netflix fans won\u2019t follow them to a comic book? \u201cBecause of the pandemic, this is the Year Without Movies \u2013 and you\u2019re asking me if we\u2019re sorry we\u2019re doing this as a graphic novel?\u201d says De Campi. \u201cLook, making stuff is hard. Get your work out any way you can. And who says this won\u2019t also be a movie one day, when it\u2019s safe to shoot again?\u201d\n\nJones, who is also working on a film adaptation of the 2000AD comic Rogue Trooper, is convinced that Moon and Mute fans will enjoy Madi, even if they don\u2019t normally read comics.\n\n\u201cStorytelling is storytelling,\u201d he says. \u201cFrom drive-in movies to stories around the campfire. If someone can engage you, they\u2019ll paint the picture in your mind ... and the painters I\u2019m working with are pretty exceptional.\u201d", "author": ["David Barnett"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/news/audio/2020/may/21/will-millions-of-children-really-be-returning-to-school-in-june-podcast", "published": "2020-05-21T00:00:39", "title": "Will millions of children really be returning to school in June?- podcast", "text": "Oliver de Botton is a headteacher of a large state school in Newham, east London.

He was concerned, he said, that black people are four times more likely to die from Covid-19 in the UK than the national average, and he needed to protect his five-month-old son, who has had breathing difficulties. \u201cIt only takes one person to get infected within the group, and I don\u2019t want to be bringing that home,\u201d he said.\n\nHis concerns were understandable, but at the time he seemed to be being perhaps a little overcautious. The number of excess deaths among BAME communities has not been fully explained, but people from ethnic minorities are overrepresented in many high-risk groups, such as those employed in critical industries including health, transport and essential retail businesses, those living in areas of high depravation and in overcrowded homes, and those with certain relevant underlying health conditions. People from BAME backgrounds are more likely than average to be in poorly paid jobs, to be unable to work from home, and so to be forced for financial reasons to put themselves at risk of infection, or to be living with someone who is.\n\nTroy Deeney and several Watford teammates stay away from training Read more\n\nDeeney, however, is not. These numbers should not apply to him, or anyone with the space, the means and the inclination to cocoon themselves and their families. Most Premier League players should be as safe from infection as it is possible to be.\n\nThen the Premier League tested 748 people, players and support staff at 19 top-flight clubs, and found that six had Covid-19. Three of those work at Watford, including the centre-back Aidy Mariappa. Six is a small enough number for the initial reaction to have been relief \u2013 our back-page headline declared that \u201cjust six test positive\u201d \u2013 but in many ways this was a surprisingly hefty return.\n\nIt is just a snapshot, with a relatively small sample size, and thus a number of caveats must apply, but the fact that at least 0.8% of key playing and support staff at Premier League clubs had Covid-19 \u2013 eight weeks after the UK lockdown was imposed \u2013 is unexpected (and given the accuracy of swab testing the true figure could be higher). At Watford about 7.5% of those tested were positive, enough to make Deeney\u2019s concerns look completely reasonable, perhaps even understated.\n\nLast week the Office for National Statistics released provisional results of its infection survey, undertaken in partnership with the universities of Oxford and Manchester, Public Health England and the Wellcome Trust. Its conclusion was that outside of hospitals and care homes, between 27 April and 10 May around 148,000 people in England had Covid-19 at any one time, roughly 0.26% of the population. Its upper estimate was 222,000 people, or 0.41%. As the impact of the lockdown continues to be felt, and the impact of people being encouraged to return to work is yet to significantly hit, that figure should have decreased since.\n\nYet at Premier League clubs the figure from tests on Sunday and Monday was at the very least twice as big \u2013 equivalent, if mirrored across the country, to there being 451,500 people in England with Covid-19 \u2013 and closer to the 1.33% found by the ONS among those working in patient-facing healthcare or resident-facing social care roles, people whose jobs put them at the highest level of risk.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Aidy Mariappa was one of three Watford employees to test positive for Covid-19. Photograph: Tess Derry/PA\n\nWe already knew that three members of Brighton\u2019s squad had tested positive for Covid-19. If they were among the 28 players who have been in three or more matchday squads this season, that would amount to 10.7% of the total. Even if no other players have had the virus without being tested or without testing positive, this would mean the Seagulls\u2019 first team have endured an outbreak on a similar scale to that in Madrid or the estimated 10% of people in Lombardy, the focus of Italy\u2019s coronavirus calamity, believed to have contracted the virus.\n\nIt is important not to get overexcited by small samples, to note that 16 of the 19 clubs tested on Monday produced no positive tests, and to acknowledge that testing positive does not necessarily mean that you have been hosting bunga bunga parties. \u201cI\u2019ve been scratching my head to try to work out how I might have got coronavirus,\u201d Mariappa told the Telegraph. \u201cIt was a big surprise because I haven\u2019t really left the house, apart from some exercise and the odd walk with the kids.\u201d\n\nThis is a cruelly efficient virus, particularly skilled at insinuating itself into the bodies of even the most wary, and some or even all of the Premier League six may just have got unlucky.

I know who I prefer | Andrew Lawrence", "text": "I am hard pressed to name another athlete who has dominated my life quite like Michael Jeffrey Jordan. You see, I was born in Chicago a few years before he arrived in town and I came of age as he himself blossomed from a college hero into a global icon. Somewhere deep inside an armoire drawer, I have a t-shirt that reads: \u201cSorry Sir Charlie, You Can\u2019t Be Like Mike\u201d \u2013 a disintegrating curbside souvenir from Game 3 of the 1993 NBA finals, one of a dozen-odd Bulls games I was lucky enough to attend during the team\u2019s storybook run. When ESPN announced plans for The Last Dance documentary, I felt vindicated. Here, at last, was the Air-tight argument that would put basketball\u2019s all important greatest of all time debate to rest. LeBron James stans would have no choice but to bow down to the man who unironically calls himself \u201cBlack Jesus\u201d.\n\nMichael Jordan's furious desire to conquer all still burns decades later Read more\n\nAnd bow down they did, according to a nationwide ESPN poll timed to coincide with Sunday\u2019s Last Dance finale. When the network surveyed 615 hoops fans to choose the better player between Jordan and James, 73% opted for the former. Jordan scored with older fans (four-to-one ) and younger ones (two-to-one). He swept all 17 voting categories on offer, the overwhelming choice to take a game-winning shot (76%) and share a drink with (65%). Even Jordan\u2019s more narrow victories in categories such as \u201ctrust to pass you the ball\u201d (57%), \u201cchoose as a teammate\u201d (63%) and positive off-court impact (62%) were comfortable enough. Never mind if these lopsided margins benefited from recency bias. (The polling was conducted over the weekend of episodes seven and eight, as James and his active NBA counterparts were on coronavirus lockdown.)\n\nRightfully, I should be basking in Jordan\u2019s mandate. But truth be told I have never been more conflicted.\n\nWhen I was a kid, it was enough to take Jordan at face value. As far as I knew, he was an otherworldly basketball player whose vast skill owed as much to natural talent as sweat equity, and whose clutch gene traced to a never-say-die attitude. Sure, there were reports of him sparring with management and tangling with teammates. And sure, there was more recent evidence of him snubbing selfie-seeking rappers, stiffing kids out of free Air Jordans and doubling down on grudges in maybe the most bitter hall of fame speech ever delivered. But it was difficult to argue with the results.\n\nForget growing the NBA globally. Jordan was an excuse to put off homework for a few hours, a reason to get together with friends \u2013 a blissful diversion for me as my parents went through a lengthy divorce. He was an uncomplicated superstar for a relatively quiet time in history when wars were over in a month and the greatest question facing humanity was whether Ross and Rachel would end up together. It was clear to everyone that we were living in a moment.\n\nBut now that the moment has passed, who could appraise Jordan on his basketball skill alone anymore? As much as The Last Dance tried to keep a tight focus on the court, with Jordan the executive producer hand-checking the viewer all the while, I couldn\u2019t help but note the many belittling references to his \u201csupporting cast\u201d or the villainizing of Bulls GM Jerry Krause \u2013 who, it should be noted, is dead and unable to defend himself. I watched Jordan dismiss his 80s-era teammates as womanizing cokeheads and take pride in bullying benchwarmer Scott Burrell and Steve Kerr. I watched him explain away his famous \u201cRepublicans buy sneakers too\u201d line as a joke.\n\nMore to the point: I watched Jordan speak adoringly about his parents and brother and the off-duty Chicago cops in his entourage without really making much mention of his three adult children. In fact, I was convinced that was where the documentary was headed after Jordan\u2019s passionate soliloquy on the price of winning. But the kids only appear briefly toward the end of the series. Certainly, when it came to shutting out the distractions of the world, nobody did it better than MJ. But we don\u2019t live in that world anymore. Hence why, an adult now, I find myself gravitating more and more toward James.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The Last Dance has been essential viewing for basketball fans in the past few weeks. Photograph: Christina Mushi-Brunt/AP\n\nAt worst James is the single greatest success story in team sports, a child prodigy who not only overcame the hardscrabble circumstances of his youth but fulfilled every expectation that was ever foisted upon him. And then he went well beyond even that. He forced his high school friends on his early money minders, and today they are part of his billion-dollar enterprise. He married his high school sweetheart and can reliably be seen embarrassing his three kids on the family\u2019s Taco Tuesday night; he waffles openly between kicking himself for passing his name to his first born-son and flogging himself to hang around the league long enough to play with him. He denounces the unjust killings of unarmed black men, tangles with the commander-in-chief \u2013 he built a school in his hometown before jetting off to Los Angeles, for goodness sakes. At the very least he should have drawn even with Jordan in the ESPN poll\u2019s \u201cpositive off-court impact\u201d category.\n\nIs LeBron James a better player than me? Is Hawkeye better than Green Arrow? Read more\n\nAs for on the court, well, James sees himself more clearly as MJ\u2019s teammate than his rival. \u201cMe personally, the way I play the game \u2013 team first \u2013 I feel like my best assets work perfectly with Mike,\u201d James said in a video released Monday on Uninterrupted\u2019s YouTube channel. \u201cIt would\u2019ve been a whole \u2018nother level with me being that point forward alongside of him during those Chicago runs.\u201d\n\nDoubtless many old school basketball fans will read that statement as an indictment of the present generation of NBA stars who would sooner consolidate primacy in free agency than battle one another for it on court. And 10-year-old me probably would have scoffed at it, too. But now that I\u2019m four times as old and a father myself? How could I not think the guy who builds bridges would make a better role model for my son than the guy who would torch anything that lies in his path?\n\nThat is not to say one player is better than the other. On that score it\u2019s a shame that basketball isn\u2019t more like football, where intergenerational talents are seen for what they truly are: descendants of the same line. Just as there\u2019s no Tom Brady without Joe Montana, there\u2019s no LeBron without Jordan. There\u2019s no Kobe Bryant, a GOAT challenger whose copycatting of Jordan I once found as grating as nails on a chalkboard. But when Bryant explained, in footage shot for The Last Dance before his death this year, that his career was essentially a love letter to Jordan, all I could take away was regret. Clearly, eternal greatness doesn\u2019t have to be a zero-sum game. It could just be a pleasant distraction, a standard to aspire. It could just be a body of work to appreciate in its time that encapsulated a moment that won\u2019t soon be forgotten.", "author": ["Andrew Lawrence"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/sport/live/2020/may/20/liverpool-v-newcastle-united-premier-league-1996-as-it-happened", "published": "2020-05-20T22:00:19", "title": "Liverpool 4-3 Newcastle United: Premier League 1996 \u2013 as it happened!", "text": "What term do you want to search?

Tennis players can be seen asking for three of them and then discarding one before serving, but the impression is that that this has more to do with superstition than anything else. Footballers are not too bothered about which balls they kick. Admittedly England\u2019s rugby players in the 2011 World Cup faced allegations of \u201cball-tampering\u201d \u2013 Jonny Wilkinson\u2019s kicking mentor, Dave Alred, and the fitness specialist, Paul Stridgeon, were suspended after England\u2019s 67\u20113 victory against Romania when found to have illegally switched balls so Wilkinson could attempt conversions with his favourite. But this was a freakish occurrence.\n\nIn cricket there have been arguments about balls for decades. On the 1976-77 tour of India, John Lever was accused of cheating by the India captain, Bishen Bedi, who believed Lever was applying Vaseline to the ball to enhance the shine and keep it swinging. The New Zealand players in 1990 admitted to using bottle tops to change the condition of the ball in Faisalabad; Imran Khan once admitted he had used the same implement. Mike Atherton nearly lost his job as England captain after the \u201cdirt in the pocket\u201d affair in 1994; in 2018 Steve Smith, David Warner and Cameron Bancroft did lose theirs after the sandpaper incident in South Africa.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest England\u2019s Chris Woakes prepares to polish the ball before passing it to Stuart Broad during last year\u2019s Ashes Test match at Lord\u2019s. Photograph: Adrian Dennis/AFP via Getty Images\n\nAlong the way, arguments over the condition of the ball caused Pakistan to refuse to take to the field in a Test at the Oval in 2006 and the game was abandoned, while Marcus Trescothick has happily acknowledged the assistance of Murray Mints to make the ball swing during the epic Ashes series of 2005. They aren\u2019t all mad; there is some logic here. Captains and bowlers are desperate to make that ball move in the air or off the pitch. Otherwise they are liable to spend an awfully long time in the field.\n\nInitially that movement was more likely to be achieved by picking the seam. This entailed using the thumbnail to raise the seam, which became so proud that it was far more likely to grip upon hitting the surface before, hopefully, changing direction. There were a few poachers who would become gamekeepers in that era. Ken Palmer, who played in the 1960s and umpired in the 80s and 90s, was renowned as a superb, one\u2011handed seam-picker.\n\nSo, too, was Stuart Turner of Essex, known as \u201cthe Whistler\u201d since you could hear the ball with its high seam fizzing towards you when he was bowling. In those days the umpires rarely examined the ball. Bowling just before lunch at Taunton I might spend my time urgently flattening the seam \u2013 since the umpires might just have a look at the ball during the interval.\n\nReverse swing began in the 80s, though most of us did not realise it at the time. There was merely bewilderment that Sarfraz Nawaz of Pakistan and Northamptonshire could suddenly make a ball that was 60 overs old start to swing in to the right-handers. I remember being another confused victim, caught at bat-pad in a Test. Sarfraz helped to educate Imran and the next generation, which included the great Wasim Akram and Waqar Younis. The Aussies became aware of this phenomenon too but, like the English, they couldn\u2019t quite explain it.\n\nEnglish summer: protocols, a 30-man squad and maybe even some cricket | Vic Marks Read more\n\nWasim and Waqar soon became the masters of reverse swing and they would educate their county colleagues at Lancashire and Surrey. The ball had to be handled delicately as if it was a precious diamond. One side would be polished, the other had to be bone dry and to acquire an almost dimpled effect. At one county captains\u2019 meeting at Lord\u2019s some \u201coffending\u201d balls were passed around.

Even the best were tormented. The image remains of Graeme Hick coming out to bat in the 1992 series: Waqar knew what he was going to bowl, Hick knew what Waqar was going to bowl, yet there was nothing the batsman could do about the perfect inswinging yorker. In time England caught up. In 2005 it was the ability of Simon Jones and Andrew Flintoff to make the ball reverse swing that began to spook Australia. Sometimes that movement is barely perceptible from a distance, but if the batsmen and bowlers think \u201cit\u2019s reversing\u201d the balance of the game has changed.\n\nThis is why there remains this seemingly preposterous debate about ball maintenance as the prospect of some Test cricket this summer grows. We have heard from the ICC about the relative risks of applying saliva and sweat. The Kookaburra ball-makers in Australia are experimenting with wax applicators to aid bowlers.

Sign up here.\n\nAttorney Sidney Powell has fired a broadside at Judge Emmet Sullivan.\n\nOn Tuesday, she filed a writ of mandamus asking the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to order Sullivan to grant the Justice Department\u2019s motion to dismiss the case against her client, Gen. Michael Flynn.\n\nThe Court of Appeals should issue that order and override Sullivan\u2019s unprecedented and, frankly, bizarre behavior in opening up the criminal prosecution of Flynn to input from outside parties and appointing John Gleeson, a former federal prosecutor and retired federal judge (who recently penned an op-ed attacking the Justice Department), to argue against the department\u2019s motion.\n\nANDREW McCARTHY: THE SUSAN RICE MICHAEL FLYNN CYA EMAIL\n\nGleeson has even told Sullivan that he may need to engage in \u201cadditional factual development.\u201d In other words, a nonparty, private lawyer is making the astounding proposal that he be given the powers of a government prosecutor.\n\nThe Justice Department moved to dismiss the charges against Flynn after an internal investigation revealed troubling information about the prosecution. The department concluded that it could not prove its case to a jury beyond a reasonable doubt.\n\nThe department has now determined that the FBI had no evidence justifying an interview of Flynn in the first place. That interview resulted in the claim that Flynn \u201clied\u201d to the FBI. A valid prosecution would require that the alleged lie be \u201cmaterial\u201d to an investigation. Since there was no legitimate basis for an investigation, the \u201cmateriality\u201d requirement could not be met.\n\nRather than try to respond to the procedural nightmare Sullivan has created, Powell is now trying to go over his head.\n\nSo what is a writ of mandamus? It is a request that a higher court order a lower court to perform its duty properly. The power of mandamus is given to federal appellate courts by The All Writs Act (28 U.S.C. \u00a7 1651). As a Justice Department manual on court procedures notes: \u201cMandamus is an extraordinary remedy, which should only be used in exceptional circumstances of peculiar emergency or public importance.\u201d\n\nIn Cheney v. U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia (2004), the Supreme Court established three conditions that Flynn \u2013 or any other petitioner \u2013 must meet before a writ can be granted:\n\nhe must demonstrate that he has \u201cno other adequate means to obtain the relief\u201d he requires;\n\nhis right to the writ must be \u201cclear and indisputable;\u201d\n\nthe court \u201cin the exercise of its discretion must be satisfied that the writ is appropriate under the circumstances.\u201d\n\nPowell makes a strong case that this matter meets all of those requirements.\n\nPowell also argues that Judge Sullivan\u2019s behavior in the case \u201creveal[s] a deep-seated antagonism\u201d toward Flynn.\n\nPowell argues that by refusing to grant the government\u2019s motion to dismiss, Sullivan has \u201cexceeded\u201d his authority, \u201cegregiously abused\u201d his discretion, and is defying precedents of both the D.C. Circuit and the Supreme Court. That includes a 2016 decision, U.S. v. Fokker Servs., in which the Court of Appeals said that the power of a district court judge like Sullivan is \u201cnarrow\u201d and circumscribed when the government requests the dismissal of a prosecution.\n\nThat power is limited to ensuring that government prosecutors are not engaging in harassment by repeated prosecutions \u2013 dismissing a case only to refile it again later against the same defendant. Here, it appears that it is the judge who is engaging in possible harassment, not the prosecution. The Court of Appeals specifically said in Fokker that a judge can\u2019t deny a motion to dismiss a prosecution just because the judge \u201chas a disagreement with the prosecution\u2019s\u201d decision.\n\nMoreover, Powell points out that, by opening up the case to third parties to file amicus briefs and appointing a retired judge to argue against the government, Sullivan is acting in direct defiance of another Supreme Court decision issued less than two weeks ago.\n\nIn U.S. v. Sineneng-Smith, a unanimous court chastised (and vacated a ruling by) the Ninth Circuit for engaging in similar behavior, opening up a criminal case to third parties to file amicus briefs and instructing them to address an issue that had not been raised by either the government or the defendant in the case.\n\nPowell also argues that Sullivan\u2019s behavior in the case \u201creveal[s] a deep-seated antagonism\u201d toward Flynn. At Flynn\u2019s initial sentencing hearing, she notes, Sullivan \u201cpublicly berated\u201d Flynn, although the government had reassured the judge that Flynn had given them \u201csubstantial cooperation.\u201d The judge, she writes, \u201csuggested [Flynn] may have committed \u2018treason,\u2019 asserted that he had \u2018sold [his] country out,\u2019 and expressed \u2018disdain\u2019 and \u2018disgust\u2019 for General Flynn\u2019s conduct \u2013 flat wrong on crucial facts of the case.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nPowell argues that these criticisms \u201ceven uttered in private conversation,\u201d would be grounds for Sullivan to recuse himself from the case. Saying \u201cthem to the world\u201d makes \u201cfair judgment impossible.\u201d\n\nThis is the United States, not France or one of the handful of other countries where the roles of prosecutors and judges are combined. As Powell correctly argues, our Constitution places the law enforcement and prosecutorial functions in the executive branch, not the judicial branch. Sullivan has \u201cdisregarded the constitutional imperative of a \u2018case and controversy\u2019 and the \u2018separation of powers\u2019 that invest the power to prosecute solely in the executive branch.\u201d He has \u201cno authority to adopt the role of prosecutor or change the issues in the case by inviting or appointing amici to perform the investigation or prosecution that the court deems appropriate.\u201d\n\nPowell summarizes Sullivan\u2019s errant behavior by using Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 well-known baseball analogy: \"This is an umpire who has decided to steal public attention from the players and focus it on himself. He wants to pitch, bat, run bases and play shortstop. In truth, he is way out in left field.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nPowell not only asks the Court of Appeals to order Sullivan to dismiss the prosecution, but she also asks the court to assign another judge to the case for any final proceedings that may occur: \u201cone who has not implied that [Flynn] is a traitor.\u201d\n\nThe interests of fundamental fairness and the objective, nonpartisan administration of justice favor the Court of Appeals granting both of those requests.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY HANS VON SPAKOVSKY", "author": ["Hans Von Spakovsky", "Hans A.

But, Fauci\u2019s warning applies equally well to the \u201creally serious\u201d consequences of opening too late.\n\nOf course, Fauci is an immunologist focused on the pandemic, not a businessperson or an economist. While it\u2019s important to heed the advice of medical experts, it\u2019s a mistake to ignore the economic costs of their recommendations in terms of both human suffering and death.\n\nAs stated by President Trump, we can\u2019t let the COVID-19 \u201ccure be worse than the problem itself.\u201d The severe physical and emotional impact of unemployment on American workers lends credence to the president\u2019s concern.\n\nADAM LAXALT: CORONAVIRUS AND TRANSPARENCY \u2014 THESE GOVERNORS USING CRISIS TO HIDE ACTIONS FROM CITIZENS\n\nA recent Federal Reserve Bank survey found that almost 40 percent of people in households making less than $40,000 a year who had jobs in February, lost their jobs in March. Commenting on the survey, Fed Chairman Jerome Powell observed that \u201c[t]his reversal of economic fortune has caused a level of pain that is hard to capture in words, as lives are upended amid great uncertainty about the future.\u201d He makes an important point.\n\nI still recall being a 25-year-old in 1975 supporting a wife and two children, finishing college, and preparing to enter law school. The economic and emotional pressures were intense, alleviated only by the fact that I had a job, could feed my family, and pay our rent and utilities while looking forward to a better life. A sudden government shutdown that resulted in me losing my job and having to face the prospect of being unable to feed or house my young family, let alone complete my education, would have been devastating.\n\nIt\u2019s hard to even imagine sitting home day after day for weeks \u2013 maybe months \u2013 with those I loved, able to work but prohibited from doing so, our only source of income a government check. I certainly would have appreciated that check, but government largesse is a meager substitute for the dignity of a job, the security of a paycheck and the opportunity to succeed.\n\nIf I lived in a state that insisted on remaining shut down, knowing that the risks for a healthy 25-year-old from the virus were very low (a death rate of roughly 0.03 percent for people in their 20s), I would have joined the protesters fighting for the right to resume their lives. If the governor of my state nonetheless persisted in keeping the economy on lockdown, the associated frustration, despair and misery would have taken a severe physical and emotional toll.\n\nWe always knew the shutdown was a tradeoff between economic damage and slowing the spread of the disease. In this respect, the shutdown initially made sense. Reopening the economy will similarly be a tradeoff that makes sense.\n\nAs such, I was not at all surprised to learn that a recent study entitled \u201cProjected Deaths of Despair From COVID-19\u201d by the Well Being Trust and the Robert Graham Center for Policy Studies in Family Medicine and Primary Care, predicted that a massive number of Americans could die due to the shutdown \u201cif we do not do something immediately.\u201d\n\nLabeling deaths of despair from drugs, alcohol and suicide an \u201cepidemic within the pandemic,\u201d the researchers estimated total deaths ranging around 27,644 (assuming a quick recovery, with unemployment having the smallest impact) to 154,037 (assuming a slow recovery and unemployment having the greatest impact).\n\nThe Deaths of Despair study\u2019s number one suggestion for avoiding these deaths: \u201cGet People Working.\u201d\n\nThis is not to say that the government shutdown was the wrong decision. The government\u2019s goal was to find a way to deal with the disease so as to avoid overwhelming our health system as had occurred in Italy and Spain. It appears to have succeeded. Even in the places hardest hit by this disease, we have avoided that potential catastrophe.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe always knew the shutdown was a tradeoff between economic damage and slowing the spread of the disease. In this respect, the shutdown initially made sense. Reopening the economy will similarly be a tradeoff that makes sense.\n\nThe economic and humanitarian costs of the shutdown are growing and could easily spiral out of control while the public-health risks appear to be diminishing. Rather than dead bodies piling up like cordwood as predicted when it reopened, Georgia announced Tuesday that it had the lowest number of COVID-19 positive patients hospitalized since hospitals started reporting data on April 8, with a 34 percent decrease from 1,500 patients hospitalized on May 1 to 986 on May 18.\n\nOur lives have changed.

Prior redactions had already demonstrated that the meeting\u2019s central purpose was to discuss the rationale for withholding intelligence about Russia from the incoming Trump national-security team.\n\nIt is perfectly obvious that not all Russia information was being withheld. Indeed, the following day, Comey would join other intelligence chiefs to brief then-president-elect Trump on Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 campaign (and we now know the FBI treated Comey\u2019s conversation with Trump as an investigative mission). What Obama officials decided to conceal was the Obama administration\u2019s investigation of the Trump campaign \u2014 a probe based on the absurd theory that Trump\u2019s campaign had conspired in the Kremlin\u2019s hacking and other cyber espionage operations.\n\nCLICK HERE TO CONTINUE READING ANDREW McCARTHY'S COLUMN IN THE NATIONAL REVIEW\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM ANDREW McCARTHY", "author": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.

CHOTANI: MEDICAL TREATMENT FOR NON-CORONAVIRUS PATIENTS MUST RESUME \u2013 HERE'S HOW TO DO IT SAFELY\n\nAmericans want two things: to get back to business and to not endanger the health of their loved ones and themselves. The better we control the virus, the sooner we can restart our economy, because to protect livelihoods, we must protect lives. And the quicker we get back to work, the healthier we will be.\n\nToday we released our recommendations \u2013 a four-level, color-coded alert system. Think of it as a weather report on the virus that does three things.\n\nThis alert system should be implemented by state governments \u2014 with wide consultation within society \u2014 and then applied at both state and local levels.\n\nFirst, it empowers you to protect yourself and your family. There are times when older adults and people with serious health conditions should be extra careful to avoid infection. And businesses, schools, health care facilities, nursing homes, and others need practical information on what they can do at different levels of risk.\n\nWe need to know about a looming or receding threat such as a hurricane. Increased risk of the new coronavirus should be communicated similarly so people know what they can do to protect themselves and their loved ones. Knowing that this is a week to wear your mask when you\u2019re indoors and near other people should be as easy and straightforward as bringing an umbrella to work on a rainy day.\n\nSecond, it holds government \u2013 and all of us \u2013 accountable. We found the seven best measures to track to know how widely the virus is spreading, how ready our hospitals and health workers are, and how safe our public health system can keep us. And we made sure to account for both health and economics, which are in sync, not in conflict here.\n\nThird, this system can accelerate progress reducing risk by focusing on crucially important things we can do to restore economic activity and fight the virus without rekindling the pandemic.\n\nThere are basic principles to follow (our recently released guidelines are here, an explanation of them here, and details of what a system would look like in your community here). They communicate a simple, practical message:\n\nIt\u2019s not about open vs. closed or health vs. economics. It\u2019s about stages of opening and about accelerating economic recovery while keeping people as safe as we can.\n\nWhen there are lots of cases, health care or basic control measures are getting overwhelmed, more precautions \u2014 washing your hands, teleworking, cleaning dirty surfaces well \u2013 will protect you and others.\n\nWhen cases decline, it\u2019s safer to resume some normal activities, while still physical distancing wherever possible and not having large gatherings.\n\nWhen the virus is better controlled, we move toward a new normal, continuing safety measures such as regular handwashing, protecting the most vulnerable and not going out if we\u2019re sick.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIt\u2019s not about open vs. closed or health vs. economics.

Better a sleepwalker, many voters seem to think, than the rolling chaos of a second Trump term.\n\nYet somehow, the Biden campaign has decided to abandon Biden's greatest advantage: his promise of a sedated interregnum.\n\nInstead, according to The New York Times, Biden's campaign will embrace radical proposals. \"With Mr. Biden leading President Trump in the polls, the former vice president and other Democratic leaders are racing to assemble a new governing agenda that meets the extraordinary times \u2014 and they agree it must be far bolder than anything the party establishment has embraced before,\" The Times reported.\n\nAre Americans truly desperate for a reshaping of our medical system, a universal basic income and trillions more in debt?\n\nSome of the new proposals are directly from the Sanders campaign: forgiving student loans, a Green New Deal, expansion of government health care, a government jobs plan, a ban on stock buybacks and compulsion toward profit sharing for corporations.\n\nMeanwhile, former President Barack Obama explained over the weekend that the coronavirus has merely underscored deep-seated American racism that requires a complete remaking of our society. Equating disparate health and incomes between black Americans and white Americans due to COVID-19 with the shooting of black Georgian Ahmaud Arbery \u2014 and citing both as legacies of America's historic racism \u2014 Obama stated, \"No generation has been better positioned to be warriors for justice and remake the world.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut do Americans really want the world remade?

Russian agents had infiltrated our government at the highest levels. Honorable former naval officers -- people who seemed honorable, anyway, like Carter Page -- were, in fact, secret stooges of Vladimir Putin's and they were working toward diabolical ends with political consultants like Roger Stone.\n\nIt was all hiding in plain sight, and it was working. Forget Mexico or Saudi Arabia or the United Arab Emirates or many other countries. It was Russia, more than any other place that threatened America's sovereignty, that was actually in control of our foreign policy.\n\nThat's the story they told us. None of it was ever plausible. In fact, it was completely absurd. It was obviously absurd. There was never any evidence that it was true, but they kept saying, day after tiresome day, until it stuck. Until every single CNN viewer, every single PBS donor, every subscriber to The New Yorker Magazine believed it as a matter of religious faith.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRussia hacked our democracy.

Attack on the integrity of our elections.\n\nHillary Clinton: The first time we've had an adversary attack us that we have not responded.\n\nThese people -- brandishing their silly credentials like we have a moral obligation to listen to them because they know what they're talking about. They were fools. Reading their stupid talking points again and again, like they were real.\n\nBut they were doing it for a reason. The beauty of the Russia fable was that it allowed these people, our ruling class, to ignore the huge number of actual problems the United States faced, problems that, in many cases, they caused or at the very least, failed to solve.\n\nWhile our leaders in Washington wasted literally years accusing each other of working for Putin, China grew more powerful. It grew closer to replacing the United States as the world's dominant nation.\n\nThe drug addiction crisis that has killed tens of thousands, hundreds of thousands, over time. The border that is essentially open. A disappearing middle class, the core of our country. The rise of China, and then, of course, any number of counterproductive foreign wars that should have ended long ago.\n\nFor three years, nobody in Washington talked about any of this. In fact, failing to worry about Russia exclusively invited suspicion on you.\n\nIf you wanted, for example, American troops home from the Middle East or if you wondered aloud why no one seemed to care when your 23-year-old niece died of a fentanyl OD, that might be evidence you, too, are colluding with Russia. And that's not an exaggeration. Susan Rice -- who seems smart, she went to Stanford -- admitted later that she decided Michael Flynn was a Russian spy because he talked too much about China, and that's what Russian spies do.\n\nNow, Donald Trump was elected -- no one thought he would be -- precisely because he talked about issues like these, the ones that mattered. That was a massive threat. So they derailed, to a large extent, his first term agenda, using a hoax concocted by the administration he replaced.\n\nWho benefited from this? Well, the people who thought it up. But nobody benefited more than the Chinese government. While our leaders in Washington wasted literally years accusing each other of working for Putin, China grew more powerful. It grew closer to replacing the United States as the world's dominant nation.\n\nBy the time this version of coronavirus spread West from Wuhan, China was calling many of the shots internationally. We didn't even know it until the crisis hit.\n\nFor example, the U.S. has given far more money than any other nation to the World Health Organization. And yet strangely, our ally, Taiwan, still is not a member of the WHO. Why is that? Only one reason -- China doesn't want them to be, and so they're not.\n\nChina is effectively in control of the WHO. You want proof? Watch the director of the World Health Organization repeat the most ridiculous Chinese propaganda as if it were all completely true with an utterly straight face. As always, if you want to know who is really in charge, watch the lies they tell.\n\nIs China now too strong to criticize? Is our only option to submit? Maybe. We'll find out.\n\nDr. Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, Director-General of the World Health Organization: The Chinese government is to be congratulated for the extraordinary measures it has taken to contain the outbreak.\n\nChina is actually setting a new standard for outbreak response, and it's not an exaggeration.\n\nSo, the new standard the fake doctor you just saw is promoting, in the end, created the worst economic calamity since the Great Depression, a calamity that China benefited immensely from. China may be the only country on the globe that has become stronger in the face of this.\n\nNo doubt, the Chinese government was pleased with what their puppets at the WHO accomplished. On Monday night, the president of the United States released a letter to the World Health Organization warning that the U.S. will suspend funding permanently if the organization doesn't reform itself right away and wean itself from China. We'll see if that happens.\n\nEither way, though, the problem is much bigger than just the World Health Organization. China's tentacles extend almost everywhere in our society. The Chinese government is now deeply enmeshed in higher education in this country. It is not an overstatement. A number of university professors, including one on Tuesday, have been arrested for spying on behalf of Beijing. Literally spies on campus -- tenured spies.\n\nChina has profound influence in Hollywood, you know that. And professional sports, we saw that last year; and in corporate America, up and down the chain. The Chinese own huge amounts of real estate throughout this country -- one of the reasons your kids can't afford to live in our cities.\n\nAll of this has changed our lives in profound ways, but all of it happened with very little public notice. Why? Because the people making it possible didn't want to advertise it. They were getting very rich from it.\n\nEvery ambitious climber in corporate America knows the rules now. Don't offend Beijing, and you could be rewarded. The head of Disney's streaming service just left to become CEO of TikTok, a Chinese company. That may appall you, but in corporate America, many are envious. They wish they were him.\n\nWashington hasn't been immune to this, either. China's influence is everywhere in the capital city. Former Senator Joe Lieberman lobbies for China now. Hard to believe, isn't it? Samir Jain was a top cybersecurity official for the Obama administration. Now, he lobbies for Huawei.\n\nAnd those are just a couple of the very few who have followed the law and actually registered under FARA as foreign lobbyists. Hunter Biden never bothered to do that. Biden worked hard to sell his access to politicians in Washington -- presumably his father, Vice President Joe Biden, chief among them -- to investors who were getting rich in China.\n\nIt was never a secret. Many people in Washington knew exactly what Hunter Biden was doing, and they didn't say anything to anybody. Why? Because it didn't seem weird to them. It wasn't strange. So many other well-connected people were doing the same thing -- selling access to elected officials in Washington to the Chinese.\n\nNancy Pelosi still doesn't understand why any of this is a big deal. Pelosi has spent decades bowing to the Chinese government even as she attacks this country is racist and backward, as she does virtually every day of the week. Just the other day, Pelosi announced that no conversation about China is legitimate. It's all a distraction.\n\nPelosi: Let me just say that what the president is saying about China is interesting -- it's an interesting diversion. Let's keep our focus on meeting the needs of the American people opening our economy.\n\nYes, it's a \"diversion.\" How many antibiotics do we make in this country in the middle of a pandemic? Let's see. Zero. None. All in China. Just a diversion.\n\nWhen you watch something like Pelosi's statement, a terrifying thought creeps up from the back of your mind. Is China now too strong to criticize? Is our only option to submit? Maybe. We'll find out.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nEven now, there's certainly downsides for anyone who dare say a negative word about Beijing.

Were these deaths also the result of COVID-19 and simply not recorded as such? Or have we been paying so much attention to COVID-19 that we have neglected other threats?\n\nAs we continue our fight against this pandemic, we must adapt to meet the needs not only of those infected with SARS-CoV-2 (the coronavirus that causes COVID-19), but also of those Americans who require medical treatment unrelated to the pandemic.\n\nA vital step forward is reopening our hospitals and clinics for elective surgeries and other procedures that cannot be handled via telemedicine. But is this a step we can safely take?\n\nA recent report from Nature suggests that as many as 40 percent of infections occur in the days before patients become symptomatic themselves. In order to safely reopen our hospitals, we need to make sure that doing so won\u2019t precipitate the resurgence of the disease.\n\nWe argue that a vital approach to keep this risk down is to adopt an intelligent testing strategy for SARS-CoV-2. This strategy must achieve two goals: We must test patients to keep our hospital staff safe, and test hospital staff to ensure infection does not transmit from the hospital back into the community.\n\nThe first challenge is to reduce the risk that an asymptomatic patient will accidentally spread the virus when coming in for an elective procedure. The currently available tests will not catch every such case, but they can identify the vast majority.\n\nWhen coupled with the use of personal protective equipment (PPE) \u2013 which is no longer as scarce as before \u2013 such screenings could make a considerable difference in our ability to reopen.\n\nTesting asymptomatic patients requires that we use different types of tests and interpret them together to achieve higher accuracies.\n\nThe Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR) testing for viral RNA is the first test to become positive, doing so around four to five days after infection, but it also has a high false-negative rate and becomes less accurate over time.\n\nBy contrast, antibody testing typically starts to catch positive cases seven days after infection, but becomes increasingly accurate over time. By testing patients on the day before or day of their procedures, we are more likely to catch asymptomatic cases.\n\nTesting medical staff represents a different challenge. Regular testing of large asymptomatic groups can entail a logistical and financial burden upon the hospital or clinic. To meet this challenge, two plausible solutions are point-of-care antibody testing and pooled testing.\n\nThe point-of-care (POC) antibody testing approach has the ability to test large numbers of suspected cases even without swift access to a central laboratory. Although positive POC antibody test results would require confirmation by PCR or laboratory testing, the team can take provisional protective actions while awaiting those results.\n\nAdditionally, antibody screening can reveal the prevalence of prior infections and shed light on the prevalence of SARS-CoV-2 in the overall population being examined.\n\nThe alternative solution entails the use of \u201cpooled testing\u201d that enables the testing of large groups with relatively few tests.\n\nThe concept is simple: instead of testing each individual separately, the samples from a large number of individuals are divided into a few groups, so that fewer need to be run. If the test is negative, the entire group is considered free of the virus; if the group is positive, subgroups are then tested until the positive individual or individuals are successfully identified.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nRecent experience shows that a single positive result from RNA testing will still test positive after the addition of 63 negative samples. Once we have tested enough to understand which populations are at a higher or lower risk, we can then tailor the size of each testing group accordingly, thereby further minimizing the number of tests.\n\nThe use of pooled testing can enormously reduce the burden on health care amidst this pandemic.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThere is no doubt that for our health care system to work, it must not only meet the demands of COVID-19 patients, but must concurrently be able to continue to treat other unrelated illnesses and injuries.\n\nHospitals and clinics must reopen. But to reopen safely, they must employ intelligent testing strategies that embrace both viral RNA and antibody testing. Only then can we provide great care that defies SARS-CoV-2.\n\nAlso contributing to this op-ed were:\n\nDr. Syed S.

What was once a fringe policy position now seeps dangerously into the mainstream of the Democratic Party.\n\nThere was a time when Democratic leaders were wise enough to keep the leftist ideologues within their ranks in check. But now the far-left wing of the Democratic Party \u2013 led by socialist Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vt., who famously praised Castro's \"literacy programs\" \u2013 has taken control of the party\u2019s policy agenda.\n\nThough Sanders has dropped out of the race for the Democratic presidential nomination, former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 the presumptive Democratic presidential nominee \u2013 is embracing much of Sanders\u2019 radical agenda.\n\nJust last month, when Biden was asked if he would return to the failed, Obama-era policy of appeasing the Cuban dictatorship, he quickly responded: \"Yes, I would.\"\n\nBiden\u2019s double-down of President Barack Obama\u2019s Cuba policy is another example of his willingness to sell out America's longstanding commitments to freedom in Latin America, in order to win over the far-left wing of today\u2019s Democratic Party.\n\nIn contrast, President Trump has taken decisive action to combat the oppressive regime in Cuba. He has imposed strong sanctions on the Cuban military, which funnels vast swaths of Cuba\u2019s wealth into the hands of the nation\u2019s oppressive leaders and their cronies.\n\nBiden, on the other hand, proposes appeasement \u2013 a dangerous proposition.\n\nObama\u2019s failed policy enriched corrupt officials and enabled human rights abuses in Cuba and also propped up other socialist dictators in Latin America. This resulted in conflict, famine and mass migration across the region.\n\nThe Nicolas Maduro dictatorship in Venezuela, supported by Cuba, is harboring Hezbollah terrorists. These actions are not only a threat to the security and welfare of the region; they threaten the well-being of Americans.\n\nRecently Biden has attempted to pivot and adopt a tough-on-Cuba stance in preparation for the 2020 election, but this bears little resemblance to his actions as vice president.\n\nJust last week, Biden tried to join in opposition to Cuba being named to the United Nations Human Rights Council.

GOT THIS RIGHT\n\nThe public may never have known about the fragile state of some aspects of health care in our country if the coronavirus pandemic had not struck. But strike it did, and with a vengeance.\n\nFor years, poll after poll has shown that Americans believe our health care system is broken. As a physician who practiced medicine for years before entering the political arena, my first-hand experience shows me that Americans are indeed correct. Despite the best efforts of many in the medical community, our health care system must undergo serious changes if we are to be better able to serve our families, friends and loved ones.\n\nCOVID-19 has convinced some in our nation that the solution to the health care crisis we face is giving government the power to run the system. Yet many of those same people believe that the government has failed to properly respond to the virus.\n\nWhile the so-called public option, which is just another name for \"Medicare-for-all,\" might seem like the answer to our problems to some, empowering an institution that failed to protect the nearly 100,000 Americans who have lost their lives to the virus is the exact wrong policy. We simply can\u2019t trust Washington to make our health decisions for us.\n\nThe idea of putting thousands of bureaucrats, a very small fraction of whom have any medical background at all, in charge of our health care decisions just does not make sense.\n\nDoctors and other medical providers are best equipped to help Americans make decisions regarding their health. But the federal government is not comprised solely of medical professionals. Even those with medical backgrounds at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have struggled to put forth guidelines quickly enough to prevent the massive death toll we\u2019re seeing from the virus.\n\nThe idea, then, of putting thousands of bureaucrats, a very small fraction of whom have any medical background at all, in charge of our health care decisions just does not make sense.\n\n\"Medicare-for-all\" would be a public takeover of our health care on an unprecedented scale. It would put medical decisions for families across the country in the hands of politicians, not doctors and patients. It would drive costs up and deprive families of health care choices \u2013 at the very moment when most Americans are concerned about better and more affordable access to care.\n\nDuring these trying times in our nation, we need more choices and control when it comes to our medical conditions, not fewer. We need better quality care now more than ever, and the comfort of seeing medical professionals we choose and trust.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nFurther, many of the innovations that detect and treat COVID-19 are being developed by private entities, not government institutions.

Sign up here.\n\nThe COVID-19 outbreak that began in Wuhan, China and spread death, massive unemployment and economic dislocation around the world is just the latest example of China\u2019s long history of misconduct in its dealings with the rest of the world.\n\nAs of Tuesday night, COVID-19 was responsible for more than 321,000 confirmed deaths worldwide and over 91,000 deaths in the U.S. Confirmed cases of the disease totaled over 4.8 million around the world, including over 1.5 million in the U.S.\n\nChina lied to the world about the extent of its COVID-19 outbreak, falsely stated at first that the disease was not easily spread, and refused to cooperate with health experts from the U.S. and other nations trying to understand the nature of the novel coronavirus that causes the deadly disease.\n\nTRUMP ON CHINA TRADE DEAL: 'I FEEL DIFFERENTLY NOW ABOUT THAT DEAL THAN I DID THREE MONTHS AGO'\n\nMany lives could have been saved, hospitalizations could have been averted, and the shutdowns that nations around the world have imposed could have been far less severe if China had not tried to cover up the extent of the COVID-19 outbreak and if it had promptly halted travel by its citizens outside the country.\n\nGiven China\u2019s history, no one should be surprised that now the Chinese government is now threatening members of the U.S. Congress who have had the temerity to introduce legislation that would allow U.S. citizens to seek restitution from China for its role in the spread of COVID-19.\n\nWe have to face the truth: Chinese hostility to the rest of the world is part of a pattern exhibited by the Communist regime in the years since President Richard Nixon began his ping-pong diplomacy with China in 1971 \u2013 leading to the resumption of U.S.-China trade followed by full diplomatic relations in 1978.\n\nIn all that time, China hasn\u2019t acted as an international competitor and responsible member of the world community \u2013 it has acted like a Cold War enemy and an international outlaw.\n\nThe truth is that China has treated its relationship with the U.S. as adversarial for as long as anyone can remember. But we don\u2019t need to cover hundreds of years of history between the West and China. It is only necessary to briefly review the last 50 years.\n\nAmerica has sacrificed millions of jobs, generations of technological advantage, and our economic dominance to China.\n\nIn particular, President Bill Clinton\u2019s relaxation of trade restrictions with China was great for U.S. multination corporations, but devastating for American workers. Foreign investment in China nearly tripled in the first decade of this century, while nearly 2.5 million Americans lost their jobs.\n\nWorkers in China earn only a small fraction of the wages of U.S. workers, and China doesn\u2019t impose worker safety and environmental standards even close to those in the U.S. All that combines to make it cheaper for companies to manufacture products in China \u2013 meaning that jobs have become one of our biggest exports to that nation.\n\nOver the past two decades, the Chinese have flooded the U.S. market with everything from basic electronics, to low-cost consumer goods, to medication and medical supplies \u2013 all while buying up more and more of our advanced products along with more of our national debt. This has resulted in the one of the largest international transfers of information, technology and wealth in the history of the world\n\nIt is not unreasonable to argue that America has sacrificed millions of jobs, generations of technological advantage, and our economic dominance to China. All of this was done to enable U.S. corporations to make a fast buck by replacing American workers with cheap Chinese labor.\n\nWarning voices were out there \u2013 including then-businessman Donald Trump \u2013 but academics, globalists, and professional politicians and bureaucrats ignored them.\n\nThe list of China\u2019s harmful conduct is longer than space permits to provide here, but to cite just some examples:\n\nThe U.S. has given sophisticated rocketry and telemetry science to the Chinese that the Chinese can now use against us.\n\nWe educate thousands of Chinese nationals in American universities every year. Most return to their country with U.S. science and technology.\n\nIn the meantime, China threatens our hegemony as the world\u2019s currency of exchange.\n\nWe have paid for China\u2019s naval buildup. We have built a robust Chinese middle class.\n\nChina\u2019s abuses include aggressive and adversarial expansion in the South China Sea. The Chinese use their leverage against smaller neighbors to gain trade advantages.\n\nChina is perhaps the world\u2019s biggest polluter, but has insisted on concessions to international agreements that have the effect of permanently excluding China from having to operate under the same environmental restrictions that the European Union and the U.S. must operate under.\n\nChina continues to threaten Taiwan.\n\nThe recent manipulation of the World Health Organization into muffling warnings about the Wuhan flu outbreak has brought widespread human suffering to the world. Government actions that have stifled economic activity worldwide have created threats of starvation for tens of millions of people.\n\nDuring our current economic difficulties, China is trying to buy up American businesses.\n\nChinese companies trading on our stock exchange adamantly refuse to allow audits that are routine and required.\n\nChina continues to steal the intellectual property of our companies, or mandate that these companies share important corporate secrets or face serious consequences.\n\nIn the meantime, China\u2019s leaders use American big tech and social media companies to oppress their people. Did our high-tech wonks think that tech that they were providing to the Chinese government to spy on the Chinese was merely being used to invade privacy? The domestic intelligence is used by the Chinese to torture and kill dissidents, and more broadly, to surveil their population.\n\nNow, of course, those same American companies are offering their malevolent spying technology to state and local government tyrants to surveil Americans.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nCanada and Mexico don\u2019t mind sniping at the U.S., but we remain huge trading partners and share generally amicable relations. The same can be said for the European Union as well. Even Russia has interests that intersect with the United States.\n\nDecades of a trade surplus with the United States, rocketing economic growth, and tech transfer have fueled the hegemonic goals of China.\n\nImportant legislation permitting Americans to sue China is pending in Congress. We must also incentivize American companies to start thinking of themselves as American companies, and provide the tax, deregulatory, and red-tape slashing incentives to bring our supply chains home.\n\nSome are encouraging moving operations to Southeast Asian countries, but Chinese influence over those nations is already outsized.

It is a Washington pastime. It also appears to be the reason why former National Security Adviser Susan Rice wrote her now-infamous memo, documenting an Oval Office meeting at which top Obama administration officials resolved to withhold Russia-related intelligence from the incoming Trump administration.\n\nA key paragraph of Rice\u2019s memo, previously redacted, has now been declassified and made public. Fox News obtained a copy Tuesday from the office of Sen. Ron Johnson, R-Wis., which had sought access to the document.\n\nThe memo was written as an email \u201cto the File\u201d as Rice was leaving her office for the last time on Jan. 20, 2017, the day Donald Trump was inaugurated.\n\nDECLASSIFIED SUSAN RICE EMAIL SHOWS COMEY SUGGESTED 'SENSITIVE' INFO ON RUSSIA NOT BE SHARED WITH FLYNN\n\nIt seems that the purpose of the memo was to shift the blame to then-FBI Director James Comey for the withholding of Russia intelligence from the Trump team.\n\nRice\u2019s objective was to absolve President Barack Obama of any blame for directing that Russia information be concealed from Trump and his incoming national security team, particularly Michael Flynn, who was slated to become national security adviser.\n\nOf course, the withholding of that information would be essential if the investigation of Trump, begun by Obama\u2019s administration, were to continue after Trump took office.\n\nThough written on the day Trump was being inaugurated, Rice\u2019s email purports to memorialize an Oval Office meeting over two weeks earlier, on Jan.5, 2017. At that meeting, according to the newly disclosed paragraph in the Rice memo, Comey raised concerns about the frequency of communications between Flynn and Sergey Kislyak, then the Russian ambassador to the United States.\n\nWhen pressed by President Obama about whether he was recommending that the National Security Council withhold Russia-related information from Flynn, Comey is portrayed in the Rice memo as noncommittal.\n\nThe FBI director is said to have stated that concealment was \u201cpotentially\u201d necessary. The meeting ended with the understanding that Comey would continue to monitor the situation and get back to Obama \u201cif anything changes.\u201d\n\nREAD: DECLASSIFIED SUSAN RICE EMAIL ABOUT JAN. 5, 2017 OVAL OFFICE MEETING WITH OBAMA\n\nThe implication, obviously, is that Comey never got back to Obama. That is, if Russia information was withheld from Trump \u2013 as it was \u2013 the culprit was the FBI director who was staying on, not the outgoing president whose administration investigated Trump on the baseless claim that his campaign might have conspired with Russia to steal the 2016 election.\n\nPortions of Rice\u2019s email had previously been disclosed, but the paragraph describing the discussion between Obama and Comey had been redacted. The paragraph was just declassified by acting National Intelligence Director Richard Grenell, who provided the now un-redacted document to Sen. Johnson.\n\nThere was no evidence that Flynn had committed any crimes.\n\nThe newly disclosed paragraph underscores the intensity of the Obama administration\u2019s focus on Flynn, as well as the dearth of a factual or legal basis for investigating him, either as a criminal suspect or a clandestine agent of the Kremlin.\n\nThe Jan. 5 meeting took place at a critical juncture in the Trump-Russia counterintelligence investigation. The FBI had opened its probe under the codename \u201cCrossfire Hurricane\u201d in late July 2016. It was deemed an \u201cumbrella\u201d investigation of the Trump campaign, and came to include sub-investigations of four campaign officials.\n\nOne of those sub-investigations targeted Flynn, a retired Army lieutenant general and decorated combat commander, whom Obama had appointed head of the Defense Intelligence Agency \u2013 only to fire him when Flynn butted heads with Obama officials on policy.\n\nThe FBI\u2019s counterintelligence investigation of Flynn, codenamed \u201cCrossfire Razor,\u201d was opened in mid-August 2016. Remarkably, Flynn \u2013 who had just published a bestselling book in which he described Russia as an adversary competing globally against the U.S. \u2013 was suspected by the bureau of being a Russian agent. By then, Flynn had joined the Trump campaign as the candidate\u2019s top adviser on national security issues.\n\nThe Obama administration\u2019s purported suspicions of a conspiracy between the Trump campaign and the Russian regime to conduct cyberespionage in order to swing the 2016 election to Trump were baseless.\n\nThe Jan. 5 Oval Office meeting was held to enable intelligence agency chiefs to brief President Obama on their assessment that Russia had interfered in the 2016 campaign. The intelligence chiefs were scheduled to brief President-elect Trump the following day in New York City.\n\nAfter the presentation, Obama asked Comey and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates to stay for a follow-on meeting with Obama, Rice and Vice President Joe Biden.\n\nPreviously disclosed sections of Rice\u2019s memo indicated that both counterintelligence and law-enforcement considerations were discussed. The principal topic, Obama explained, was the need to consider a rationale for withholding Russia-related intelligence from the incoming Trump team.\n\nAs far as any law enforcement aspect was concerned, Rice took pains in her memo to stress Obama\u2019s adamancy that it should proceed \u201cby the book.\u201d\n\nFlynn was central to the Oval Office meeting. A week earlier, on Dec. 29, 2016, he had a phone conversation with Ambassador Kislyak, during which the topic of economic sanctions Obama had just imposed on Russia had been discussed.\n\nIt was entirely appropriate for Flynn \u2013 as the incoming Trump national security adviser \u2013 to engage in such conversations with foreign counterparts. On the call, Flynn had discouraged Russia from escalating tensions with the U.S. \u2013 just as we would want any American official engaged in foreign relations to do.\n\nTellingly, just a day before the Oval Office meeting, the FBI had completed a memo closing its Crossfire Razor investigation of Flynn because no evidence had been found to support the absurd suspicion that he was a clandestine agent of Russia.\n\nNevertheless, even though Flynn\u2019s conversation with Kislyak had been proper, Obama officials seemed determined to use it as a pretext for extending the investigation of Flynn.\n\nThe Flynn-Kislyak conversation would also be used to rationalize withholding from Flynn and other Trump officials Russia-related intelligence \u2013 which was in the possession of the White House National Intelligence Council that Flynn would soon be leading.\n\nWith that as background, the newly disclosed paragraph Rice wrote about the Comey-Obama discussion is illuminating.\n\nIt begins: \u201cDirector Comey affirmed that he is proceeding \u2018by the book\u2019 as it relates to law enforcement.\u201d The emphasis on law enforcement relates to potential criminal prosecution, as distinguished from counterintelligence, which is about gathering information about foreign powers, such as Russia. In that light, one wonders what \u201cbook\u201d Comey and Obama had in mind.\n\nThere was no evidence that Flynn had committed any crimes. Consequently, as shown by documents recently disclosed by the Justice Department, Comey was reduced to discussing the possibility that Flynn might have violated the Logan Act.\n\nThe Logan Act is a moribund, unconstitutional 18th-century prohibition against unauthorized diplomacy has never been used in a successful prosecution, has not been invoked since before the Civil War, and has never been the subject of an indictment in the 150-year history of the Justice Department. There could be nothing \u201cby the book\u201d about a law enforcement investigation of a purported Logan Act violation.\n\nAccording to Rice, Comey then moved on to \u201ca national security perspective\u201d \u2013 a reference to the counterintelligence probe. Again, it turned out that the FBI director had no concrete grounds for suspicion.\n\nComey said he had \u201csome concerns that incoming NSA Flynn is speaking frequently with Russian Ambassador Kislyak.\u201d\n\nEven if this were true, the number of contacts would be irrelevant \u2013 especially for an incoming national security adviser \u2013 as long as nothing nefarious was discussed. On that score, Comey had no disparaging information, even admitting that he had \u201cno indication thus far that Flynn has passed classified information to Kislyak.\u201d\n\nOn top of that nothing, Rice says the FBI director piled more nothing, observing that \u201cthe level of communication is unusual.\u201d\n\nIt is not unusual, however, for one of a new administration\u2019s top foreign relations officials to engage at that \u201clevel of communication\u201d with foreign counterparts. Kislyak, moreover, was a notoriously ubiquitous Washington figure, who rubbed elbows constantly with U.S. government officials and other diplomats.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThus, Rice claims, when Obama asked whether Comey \u201cwas saying that the NSC should not pass sensitive information related to Russia to Flynn,\u201d Comey could only respond by saying \u201cpotentially.\u201d That is, there was not a solid basis at that point for restricting Flynn\u2019s access.\n\nThe meeting is said to have concluded with the understanding that Comey would report to Obama \u201cif anything changes in the next few weeks that should affect how we share classified information with the incoming team.\u201d\n\nRice, to repeat, was writing on Jan. 20, 2017 about what supposedly happened on Jan. 5. She includes no indication that Comey ever reported back to Obama. We are left to understand that nothing about withholding Russia intelligence was really resolved at the meeting, and to assume that nothing happened afterward that would have caused President Obama to do anything further.\n\nTranslation: If it came to pass that Russia information was withheld from President Trump, National Security Adviser Flynn and the incoming Trump team, blame Comey.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOf course, the palpable reason for concealing Russian intelligence from the new president and his national security team would be to obscure the fact that the Obama administration had monitored the Trump campaign and planned for the investigation to continue even after Trump took power.\n\nThat is not something an FBI director could have pulled off on his own. Counterintelligence investigations, after all, are done for the president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY ANDREW MCCARTHY", "author": ["Andrew Mccarthy", "Andrew C.

It was discovered that the condemned man was actually innocent. But the sentence would be carried out, reasoned the hanging judge, because the partisan mob must not be left disappointed. (It would also be a waste of good lumber.)\n\nA metaphorical story, yes. But the underlying facts bear a disturbing resemblance to the treatment of Gen. Michael Flynn, President Trump\u2019s former national security adviser.\n\nIn early 2017, the retired three-star general was deviously set up and framed by James Comey\u2019s FBI for a crime he did not commit. Thereafter, he was coerced by special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s unscrupulous prosecutors into pleading guilty to the charge of lying to the FBI, even though the evidence now shows he did not lie.\n\nANDREW McCARTHY: BARR'S OBAMA-BIDEN REMARKS \u2013 AG IS MAKING THIS IMPORTANT POINT\n\nThe presiding federal judge in the Flynn case, Emmet Sullivan, is utterly unbothered by the newly revealed evidence of the defendant\u2019s innocence. He seems determined to carry out the sentencing to satisfy the partisan media mob and Democrats who agitate for the punishment of a Trump ally. Ready the scaffold.\n\nBut wait. On Tuesday, Flynn\u2019s attorneys resorted to a higher court for relief by filing a writ of mandamus before the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. They correctly argue that Sullivan should be kicked off the case and/or ordered to follow the law by dismissing the criminal charge against Flynn.\n\nIt is highly likely that the defense will prevail, notwithstanding the best efforts of Sullivan to turn the law upside down. This is because the trial court judge has no authority whatsoever to usurp the power of the Department of Justice (DOJ), which uncovered the exculpatory evidence of Flynn\u2019s innocence and decided to drop the case entirely.\n\nJudges are impartial and disinterested referees; they resolve disputes that arise at trial. They neither initiate prosecutions nor perpetuate them.\n\nJudge Sullivan might want to revisit Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. It circumscribes the role of a judge to preside over \u201ccontroversies to which the United States shall be a party.\u201d\n\nNormally, there are only two parties to a federal controversy \u2014 the prosecution, represented by the DOJ, and the defendant, who is charged with an offense. The judge is not a party at all. He or she acts as a neutral arbiter on issues that may arise in court and maintains order.\n\nWhat happens when, during the course of litigation, there is no longer a \u201ccontroversy\u201d between the two parties because it is discovered that the case has no merit? Naturally, the charge is dismissed and the case ends. The judge cannot suddenly commandeer the matter and arrogate the role of the prosecutor by pursuing a charge that, in the judgment of the feds, has lost its evidentiary value and proof.\n\nIt is a simple question of the separation of powers. The judicial branch (judges) may not supplant the authority of the executive branch (prosecutors). To do so would undermine the constitutional constraints imposed by the Framers.\n\nThis is true, even if the prosecutor is wrong in his assessment. The unfettered discretion belongs to the prosecutor alone. A judge may disagree with the decision to dismiss but has no legal authority to change it.\n\nIt is a simple question of the separation of powers. The judicial branch (judges) may not supplant the authority of the executive branch (prosecutors). To do so would undermine the constitutional constraints imposed by the Framers. Sullivan surely knows this but intends to ignore it.\n\nThese fundamental principles are sacrosanct, which makes it especially confounding that Sullivan has taken it upon himself to appoint a retired judge, John Gleeson, to oppose the DOJ\u2019s plan to dismiss the Flynn prosecution. Forget that third parties are not permitted to intervene at the trial court level, Gleeson certainly knows that Sullivan is acting well beyond his judicial authority. Yet, inexplicably, he will argue otherwise.\n\nIn a July 1, 2013, memo and order, Gleeson wrote that \u201cThe government has near-absolute power to extinguish a case that it has brought.\u201d Citing well-established case law (ICC v. Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers, 482 U.S. 270, 283, 1987), Gleeson pointed out that \u201cit is entirely clear that the refusal to prosecute cannot be the subject of judicial review.\u201d\n\nIn other words, the decision to drop a case is none of the judge\u2019s business. Period. His written approval is a merely ministerial act.\n\nHow exactly will Gleeson now argue against himself, not to mention the clarity of the law and Constitution? A recent op-ed by him in the Washington Post gives us some clues. In it, he argued that Sullivan should proceed to sentencing because the DOJ\u2019s motion to dismiss the Flynn case represents a \u201cmiscarriage of justice\u201d born of \u201ccorrupt reasons\u201d and \u201creeks of improper political influence.\u201d\n\nExcept that it does not.\n\nThe Justice Department decided to end the Flynn debacle because it uncovered documents revealing that the FBI never had a legitimate legal reason to interview him a mere four days into the Trump presidency and because the interviewing agents concluded that Flynn did not lie. Shockingly, the FBI sought to \u201cget him to lie, so we can prosecute him or get him fired.\u201d It was a classic and unconscionable perjury trap.\n\nAll of this was concealed from his defense team in violation of the law and a judicial order to produce every scrap of exculpatory evidence.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn truth, the only corruption and political influence were committed by Comey\u2019s FBI and Mueller\u2019s prosecutors. They are the ones who perpetrated a miscarriage of justice by weaponizing law enforcement for political reasons. Flynn was their victim.\n\nIt is disgraceful that Sullivan is unconcerned about such abuses of power by government operators. Why isn\u2019t he recommending that prosecutors be charged for lying to the court when they insisted repeatedly that no exculpatory evidence existed? Why isn\u2019t he demanding that the FBI be investigated for knowingly making false accusations and pushing a wrongful prosecution?\n\nTo compound the injustice, Sullivan wants Gleeson to make the case that Flynn should face a new charge of perjury contempt for seeking permission from the court to withdraw his forced guilty plea. This is ludicrous on its face. Under the law, confessions and pleas must be \u201cvoluntary.\u201d Flynn\u2019s was not. This, too, was hidden from the court in contravention of the law. A confession under threat or duress is no confession at all. Flynn\u2019s coerced capitulation does not magically create a secondary crime.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe defense had no alternative but to seek a writ of mandamus from the D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals to direct Sullivan to follow the law by dismissing the case and ordering him removed from any further proceedings. The chief judge of that very court ruled four years ago that a trial court judge cannot countermand the decision by prosecutors to dismiss criminal charges (U.S. v. Fokker Servs., B.V., 818 F.3rd 733, 740, D.C. Cir., 2016).\n\nSullivan\u2019s own outrageous bias, demonstrated time and again during his handling of the Flynn case, is an embarrassment to the federal bench.

By chance is Wallace available?\u201d) and insulting to every one his own age or younger (\u201cHey, Duncan Hines, get your little grubby paws off the food!\u201d), the Haskell persona was predictably disingenuous and self-centered.\n\nThere was only one Eddie Haskell on television, but there are a lot of Eddie Haskells everywhere else.\n\nIf I\u2019m honest, there\u2019s probably a little Eddie in me, too, those painful and regrettable times when I\u2019ve said one thing and thought or done the other.\n\nLike Eddie, too many folks love to tell you what they think you want to hear \u2013 serving up heaps of patronizing praise and flattering compliments \u2013 all while running a scam behind your back.\n\nIt\u2019s always a little silly to psychoanalyze a fictional sitcom character, but one gets the impression that Eddie Haskell was, not unlike many of us in real life, somehow wounded early in childhood.\n\nIn the fourth season, in a rare moment of self-introspection, we learn that Eddie was embarrassed in kindergarten when he was sent to school with a horrifically bad home permanent hair style. Rather than empathizing with him, his father joined in the mockery. Eddie said that was the last time he ever confided anything to his dad.\n\nI think it\u2019s safe to say that many of the people who lash out in our society were once lashed at \u2013 wounded in some form or fashion.

They are the employees who talk down to those below and kiss up to those above, thereby enraging subordinates but somehow endearing themselves to the decision-makers.\n\nBut that\u2019s no way to live and no way to win. In the end, Eddie\u2019s insecurity ultimately seeped through.

More will contract the virus and die from it than would have been the case under continued lockdowns. But this, of course, is not the full picture.\n\nA new report, \"Projected Deaths of Despair During the Coronavirus Recession,\" suggests as many as 75,000 Americans could die from \"despair\" due to unemployment, depression from isolation, and fear of the indefinite and uncertain nature of the pandemic.\n\nOne of the study's authors, Benjamin Miller, chief strategy officer for Well Being Trust in Oakland, Calif., said: \"Deaths of despair are tied to multiple factors, like unemployment, fear and dread, and isolation. Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, there were already an unprecedented number of deaths of despair. We wanted to estimate how this pandemic would change that number moving forward.\"\n\nThe study estimates that there could be 75,000 coronavirus-related \"deaths of despair\" from drug or alcohol abuse and suicide. Miller explained, \"The isolation is causing people to lose boundaries on their behaviors. ... People have to be working and we have to get people connected to other people.\"\n\nUnemployment stands at 14.7 percent, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated.\n\nAbout the study, Dr. Elie Aoun, vice chairman of the American Psychiatric Association's Council on Addiction Psychiatry, said: \"I've been seeing this in practices and my colleagues have been talking about it, too. ... Addiction patients are relapsing, and a lot of patients who don't have drug use or alcohol problems are drinking more now, sometimes every day from 4 or 5 p.m., and they don't stop until they sleep.\"\n\nEarlier this year, I wrote about the connection between suicide and unemployment. A British journal, The Lancet Psychiatry, published a study associating worldwide suicides to unemployment.\n\n\"Our findings reveal that the suicide rate increases six months before a rise in unemployment,\" said study author Carlos Nordt. \"Our data suggest that not all job losses necessarily have an equal impact, as the effect on suicide risk appears to be stronger in countries where being out of work is uncommon.\"\n\nThe study said that between 2000 and 2011, there were an estimated 233,000 suicides in 63 countries, and that the number increased during the last recession: \"While the number of unemployment-related suicides increased by about 5,000 during the recent economic crisis in 2008, this analysis shows the risk of suicide among jobless people is high even in good economic times.\"\n\nUnemployment stands at 14.7 percent, with over 20 million Americans in April filing for unemployment. The number of unemployed Americans is likely understated.\n\nBetsey Stevenson, former member of the Council of Economic Advisers as well as the chief economist of the U.S. Department of Labor, says due to an incorrect classification of \"people who were employed (but) absent from work due to COVID-related reasons as temporarily unemployed,\" the actual number of unemployed is likely over 20 percent.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nA new ESPN documentary about the Chicago Bulls' last championship season describes how Michael Jordan broke his foot early in his pro career, during the third game of the 1985-86 season.\n\nDefying his doctors' expectations, the foot healed faster than expected, and Jordan itched to return to the court despite team owner Jerry Reinsdorf's fear not only that Jordan could reinjure the foot but that such a reinjury could end his career.\n\nReinsdorf said to Jordan, \"If you had a terrible headache, and I gave you a bottle of pills, and nine of the pills would cure you and one of the pills would kill you, would you take a pill?\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nJordan responded, \"It depends on how bad the f---ing headache is.\"\n\nAmerica's economic headache from the coronavirus stay-at-home orders is f---ing bad.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM LARRY ELDER", "author": ["Larry Elder", "Larry Elder Is A Bestselling Author", "Nationally Syndicated Radio Talk Show Host.

But like all endings, it can signal a new beginning; a new chapter.\n\nRavi, my spiritual friend and mentor, died this morning, succumbing to the cancer that had crept into his life just a few months ago. A simple surgery to relieve some back problems revealed the much more sinister malady.\n\nCancer, to me, is right out of Satan's arsenal.

Because of Coronavirus, They Might Reconsider", "text": "May 20, 2020 5 min read\n\nDid people say no to you before? They might say yes now.\n\nWere they afraid of your idea before? Maybe not anymore.\n\nAnd what about you, personally? Did you think something was once impossible, or that you\u2019d reached your limit? Now you might discover otherwise.\n\nI am seeing this pattern over and over \u2014 of entrepreneurs and companies and even industries rapidly shedding what used to seem like dogma. What a massive opportunity that is.\n\nHere\u2019s an example. Aziz Hashim owns more than 700 franchise units in North America, and a few years ago, he had a crazy idea to make more money. Even during normal times, his restaurants (and most restaurants!) tend to have extra kitchen capacity. That\u2019s a problem: They had spent millions of dollars to build the facility and didn\u2019t have enough customers to fully maximize it. Meanwhile, many brands want to expand into new markets but can\u2019t afford to build a new space.\n\nSo what\u2019s the solution? Sell one brand\u2019s food out of another brand\u2019s kitchen! Meals from The Captain\u2019s Boil, a seafood brand in Canada, can be made in a Ruby Tuesday in America and delivered to a customer who ordered online. Hashim built a platform to enable those kinds of swaps, and originally envisioned it as a tool to help his own franchises. When the pandemic hit, however, he decided to open the platform up to any brand. He thought it might help the industry at large.\n\nWhen Aziz and I spoke recently, I was intrigued by his disruptive potential. His idea challenges the very notion of what a restaurant is, and it seems like the first step in a mashed-up world where anything can come from anywhere. I could imagine the restaurant industry hating it \u2014 in normal times, that is. So I asked him: Have people been faster to adopt this now, because of the pandemic?\n\nHis answer: \u201cSignificantly.\u201d\n\nSignificantly.\n\nIn fact, his company is struggling to keep up with requests. They\u2019re being flooded \u2014 from restaurants in need, yes, but also stores and hotels. If people had reservations about his concept before, they don\u2019t now. They\u2019re hungry for new ideas and new options, and he has them.\n\nThat\u2019s one example of change being sped up. And here\u2019s a much smaller, but more personal one:\n\nFor the past few years, I\u2019ve been writing a column much like this one inside every issue of Entrepreneur magazine. I love doing it, and I\u2019ve been grateful for the feedback I get from readers. Maybe, I\u2019d often thought, I could write even more columns. Maybe I could create a weekly version that runs online! But then I\u2019d stop myself. I don\u2019t have time for that, I\u2019d say. I have too much to do already. Will I even have enough ideas? Frankly, I\u2019m maxed out.\n\nWhen this crisis struck, however, I realized I had an opportunity. People wanted information and perspective, and I felt I had something to offer. So I told the team here: \u201cI\u2019m writing a weekly newsletter.\u201d How would it happen while I\u2019m at home with two little kids and an ever-growing mountain of work? I didn\u2019t know. But it felt possible \u2014 and that\u2019s all I needed. And I'm so glad I did it.\n\nThis is the crazy magic of entrepreneurs. We live in a world of challenges and setbacks, and we\u2019ve been dismissed (or dismissed ourselves!) repeatedly. We are told no, or told to stay in our lane, or told to wait our turn. But we don\u2019t listen. When the moment is right, we somehow clear our memories; we forget the boundaries that others had drawn, or that we\u2019d drawn for ourselves.\n\nThen we think: Now\u2019s the time.\n\nOr Now\u2019s the time to try again.\n\nOr Now won\u2019t be the last time I try.\n\nThis pandemic feels stifling and is causing great hardship. But that\u2019s not the end of it. There\u2019s a freedom here, too \u2014 a freedom to navigate a shaken-up world, to provide solutions to people newly in need, and to forget whatever negativity we carried over from the old world.\n\nA lot may be wrong right now, but a lot is possible as well.

Grandmothers are requesting video meetings. Masks are a fashion statement. Changes are coming quickly, somehow happening for all of us at once, despite our population never being more physically distant. It is a dizzying time. Among the groups most challenged by this torrent of societal shifts are small businesses. Doors have been closed, and some may not reopen. These, however, are some of the most resilient and creative people on the planet. Whatever the new normal becomes, small-business owners will be at the forefront of shaping life as we know it. To help stoke those masters of ingenuity, here are some current trends I think will stick around.\n\n1. Printed materials will face greater headwinds.\n\nPeople have been predicting the downfall of print for decades. That is not the prediction here. Print has remained a key part of many small-business marketing playbooks even as digital and social content has taken off. The physical nature of a brochure that can be picked up and explored creates a visceral experience that digital content has yet to replace. It is precisely that visceral aspect that will make printed materials more scrutinized even after we emerge from the worst of the crisis.\n\nThat stack of brochures in the doctor\u2019s office might start to seem unhygienic. Print materials that are literally handed from one person to another \u2014 like business cards or certificates \u2014 will be hit the hardest. Items that are viewed from a distance like posters and signs should see less impact. Adobe Spark, a product I help lead at Adobe, is already seeing drops in search demand by as much as 75 percent for some forms of print output.\n\n2. Digital channels will become a core marketing tactic for new businesses.\n\nBrick-and-mortar small-business owners are often reticent to spend their small amount of free time learning creative tools or how to build a successful social media strategy. The stay-at-home order has created both the time and the need to lean far more heavily on digital marketing.\n\nSome might expect staying at home to drive people toward a full \"Netflix and chill\" approach to spending their time. There has actually been a surge of creative activity, especially around creating videos, banners and other digital marketing content. Spark has seen a rise in search demand by as much as 75 percent for social content. If Grandma can learn Zoom, small-business owners can learn how to post to their Instagram story.\n\n3. Building a customer email list will be even more vital.\n\nThe sudden nature of this crisis made it challenging to communicate with customers. Business owners who had invested in developing customer email lists or methods for direct communication, such as social media groups, were in a far better position to maintain those relationships and manage demand as they came up with new ways to provide their goods or services.\n\nWeb sites, ecommerce, email lists and loyalty programs were wise strategies prior to now and will gain even more prominence. We might also see increased interest in developing custom mobile applications and personalization to form even tighter bonds.\n\n4. More team collaboration from a distance.\n\nStaying in touch with customers is critical, but they are not the only people you will need to communicate with from afar. Companies that already had ways to coordinate work with their employees online were in a better position to maintain operations than those who were completely reliant on face-to-face collaboration. Videoconferencing has been one of the clear beneficiaries as people from all walks of life are finding new ways to leverage the technology to stay connected. Conversations, though, are time-consuming.\n\nThe wisest businesses will take advantage of remote collaboration platforms that allow employees to work with each other asynchronously. Slack and Microsoft Teams have seen dramatic rises in usage. We have also seen an influx of new users in Spark who are taking advantage of the ability to allow businesses to set up their brand online and collaborate with others on branded digital content. Many of these products can be used for free, and given the likelihood that this situation may go on for a long time, there is every reason to get set up with them now.\n\n5. More businesses of one.\n\nNot every business can be done remotely. Technology has not enabled remote deck cleaning or massage services. That is causing many people to explore alternative sources of income. At the same time, we are seeing a huge rise in demand for remote experiences. People are turning to online fitness and cooking classes. They are picking up a guitar and taking online lessons. They are watching online concerts and performances.\n\nThe combination of skilled people at home needing to make money and bored people at home looking to enrich or entertain themselves is a recipe for a booming population of micro-entrepreneurs. One person with a skill in demand can find an audience. It may, or may not, surpass the earning potential of whatever the person was doing before, but it will open many people\u2019s eyes to new possibilities.\n\n6. Creating ongoing value that makes sense to sell as a subscription will be a major advantage.\n\nAs micro-entrepreneurs find their niche outside of the structures that usually helped them get paid, they have a unique opportunity to set their own prices and set up their own monetization structures.\n\nThis has the capacity to greatly destabilize how we value certain kinds of work or online experiences. It puts the power (and the responsibility) in the hands of individual creators, coaches or experience-makers. Savvy entrepreneurs could see greater income and stability by turning to subscription models and leaning into both live online experiences and asynchronous income sources.\n\nThis crisis is creating a strong incentive to push past any hesitation and build out an online aspect of how to operate. Many small businesses will be forced to have two business plans: one that operates when social distancing orders are lifted, and one that they can flip on when people are ordered to stay at home. These need not be mutually exclusive. The backup mode of operation can act as a way to augment existing business, even while people are allowed to physically enter the shop.", "author": ["Brian Nemhauser"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/y6atoS1Ga0Y/350219", "published": "2020-05-20T20:00:00", "title": "Why Every Franchise Should Pivot Right Now", "text": "May 20, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAmidst the chaos of our world right now, our instinct may be to hunker down, wait it out, and weather the storm \u2014 essentially, hit pause. But for business owners, and especially franchisors who have an entire network of partners to consider, hitting pause is the worst move to make. Now\u2019s the time to keep swimming to stay alive.\n\nThe way to do this is to quickly pivot. We\u2019re seeing this across every vertical in the franchise world: fitness studios are offering on-demand video workouts; dine-in restaurants are embracing technology to offer curbside pickup and delivery options; even paint-and-sip shops are offering DIY at-home kits. These smart moves not only create new, much-needed revenue streams, but they keep customers engaged \u2014 and keep brands top of mind.\n\nIn addition to adapting your business model to suit this time, franchisors must also do the hard work of proactively and strategically cutting costs. Take a look at your financials and right-size non-essential line items. If software tools can be reduced, do it. If snack or water delivery to offices can be paused, do it.\n\nRELATED: 24 Top-Ranked, Affordable Franchises You Can Buy for $25,000 or Less\n\nAnd, as painful as it may be, if there are staff positions that are redundant, consider furloughs or layoffs. It\u2019s not a move any business owner gets pleasure from, but in tough times, it may be the key to survival. Focus on retaining mission-critical roles and high-performing employees until your operation feels more stable.\n\nOf course, the key to a successful franchise is growth, and as franchisors shift their business models, they must also tweak and adapt their development programs to keep selling, even as our economy has slowed down.\n\nIn April, I spoke with a VP of Franchise Development who sold eight territories that week alone, having initiated the hosting of virtual discovery days and remote interviews. This is an inspiring move to help the company\u2019s cash flow and advancement through this tough time. If you\u2019re sitting back on selling right now, you\u2019re handing opportunity to your competitors.\n\nOne thing is certain in this uncertain time: franchise systems are only as strong as their leadership. Those who implement these best-practice, proactive steps will not only survive through this downturn, but be positioned to thrive and pull ahead of the competition.\n\nRELATED: 4-Step Entrepreneur's Guide to Surviving COVID-19\n\nFor smaller and emerging brands, view this time as an opportunity to recruit top talent to the organization and strengthen corporate teams. For larger franchises, now\u2019s the time to reassess your team, and identify areas of improvement.\n\nA few months ago, the many of talented candidates now on the market may have been inaccessible, or content at another company. Reach out, set up video chats, get the attention of covetable workers. Position your business to accelerate growth on the other side of this crisis.\n\nAnd of course, franchisors, now is the time that you must help your franchisees.

I recently had the chance to hear combat veteran and retired Navy SEAL officer Larry Yatch, co-founder of SEAL Team Leaders, present on to a select group of entrepreneurs.\n\nThe secret to success in business, Yatch says, boils down to five components: stewardship, strategy, people, execution and planning. Most companies are only good at one or two of these things, and Yatch says he has yet to meet a business that is inherently great at all five.\n\nYatch is an expert on how to differentiate between necessary and unnecessary fear, and what to do about each. In times of uncertainty and rapid change, stalling out or freezing in inaction can often be more dangerous than the actual threats we're facing.\n\nAll fear is caused by a perceived lack of control, Yatch says. But we can channel our fears into opportunities to pivot, adjust, and achieve. Yatch notes that many entrepreneurs have done this with success in the past. More than half of the Fortune 500 (Microsoft, Uber, Airbnb) and half of the companies in the S&P 500 were started during recessions. So, in a nutshell: This is the entrepreneur\u2019s time to shine.\n\nThe psychological and physical components of fear\n\nFear is a primal experience for everyone. Back to the time of cave men, our reactions to real or imagined fears can be summed up by \u201cFight, Flight or Freeze.\u201d Physiologically, we react to the stress of fear with decreased neocortex (higher cognitive brain) activity. We develop tunnel vision. Hearing shuts off. Core muscle group strength is enhanced. And time shifts (it seems like everything has moved to slow motion). These physiological reactions are useful for a caveman but can hamper us in modern life.\n\nFear happens for all of us. So courage, Yatch says, is not the absence of fear, but making the right decisions and actions in spite of our fear.\n\nIn the face of limited resources and a high-risk environment (yes, that's all of us now), we have the ability to use communication to gain power (the ability to influence change) and control (illustrated power in a given situation, such as pivoting a business or implementing a strategy to render a better outcome). When we operate in spite of fear, we illustrate courage and inspire others. So even though we are \"modern-day cavemen\" (albeit with better tools and fancier clothes) we can overcome our innate physiology to take effective action.\n\nRelated: A Navy SEAL's Guide to Thriving in Close Quarters: Engagement ...\n\nOur perceptions of danger produce fear\n\nDanger is, in essence, represented by anything that limits your ability to control your safety. A live shooter. A loss of job. A deadly virus. Fear, in turn, is the feeling of anxiety caused by the perception of danger, with perception being the operative word. Fear lives in our minds but is experienced in our bodies as the physical manifestation of a perceived lack of control.\n\n\u201cFears alone can never hurt us,\u201d Yatch says.\n\nWe must learn to separate necessary fears (being faced by a gunman or an oncoming car) from unnecessary fears (sleepless nights filled with worry over frightening possibilities, such as loss of a job, a recession, or a relationship ending).\n\n\u201cNecessary fears open possibilities,\u201d Yatch says. \u201cUnnecessary fears close possibilities.\u201d\n\nThe entrepreneurs present acknowledged unanimously that this is true. In the face of the current crisis, some leaders spring into action as if fired by a surge of adrenalin: determining what they have, what is needed, and what they need to do next. This is how many of the world\u2019s best innovations come to light. Factories pivot. Job responsibilities change. Communities come together to serve their vulnerable members and support individuals who are now without jobs.\n\nUnnecessary fears such as \u201cI don\u2019t know what\u2019s coming. My company might fail. I might get sick or lose the respect of my partner and family\u201d will dramatically lower the possibilities of success, because these types of thoughts limit you from thinking and acting productively. You can\u2019t sleep, you may drink heavily, fail to eat or suddenly eat very poorly. You walk into traffic, miss work, lose your keys and glasses.\n\nAs I often note to others, when you\u2019re frozen in fear you become your own worst enemy. You look for somebody or something to blame. You metaphorically trip on your own shoelaces, veritably ensuring you will fall.\n\nRelated: What Is Leadership? The Navy SEAL Who Killed Osama Bin Laden ...\n\nRegaining your power\n\nSince fear begins in your mind, that's where it must first be attacked, Yatch says. You must learn to manage the fear by learning, practicing, and gaining experience.\n\n\u201cKnowledge is the kryptonite to fear,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is easier to take action when you truly understand what it is you fear.\u201d\n\n\n\nNext comes practice. Like the young child learning to ride a two-wheel bike, you experience failure in a setting with limited consequences to produce a state of mind conducive to learning. In this respect, failure is a vital part of the process.\n\nExperience, then, is the combination of knowledge and practice that strengthens your ability to stare danger in the face as you take action, influence change and restore control.\n\nHow do you apply these rules to your business?\n\nIn the face of a crisis like a global pandemic or a halted economy, great leaders can apply the principles of courage to the five components of business: stewardship, strategy, people, execution, and planning.\n\nSo, for example, in a crisis, we can observe the companies that are springing into action with stewardship for their people and their customers. One notable CEO acknowledged to Yatch that his company is taking a hit of 75 to 80 percent of its revenue. He said, \u201cAs I look at our core values, the first and most important is taking care of our people. These are people who were all in, who were kicking butt, and I\u2019m going to need them on the other side. I\u2019m going to do everything I can to keep them and show them how important they are.\u201d\n\n\n\nOn the flip side, Yatch says that CEOs who are looking around for people to fire \u201cshould be firing themselves.\u201d He also that notes that some leaders, when faced with the inevitability of reducing their workforce (such as a publicly-traded company that must protect the company\u2019s ability to remain alive in the market) have gone the extra mile to help support and place the individuals affected among the other companies within the region or space.\n\n\u201cYou cannot violate the trust of these people and expect to thrive on the other side,\u201d Yatch maintains. Conversely, as your own organization pivots, now is the ideal time to recruit since the \u201cpick of the litter\u201d candidates are more available.\n\nIn the realm of strategy, are you making your employees excited about the future? Or are you spreading more negativity and fear? Yes, you need to worry about cash. But what will you do to amend that worry?\n\nExamine your core market. Take a look at your process and procedures. What is your own most critical issue right now? Study the five key priorities to map out a plan of action.\n\nFiguratively and literally, now is the time to clear out the garage. Get the mechanisms in place to scale for when you emerge on the other side of the tunnel. Instead of cowering in unnecessary fear, use the surge of adrenalin that accompanies the very real dangers you're facing, and resolve them now. This will allow you to emerge from the downturn with calmness and confidence, using the strongest reasoning power of your higher brain (and your collaboration with like-minded others) to marshal your power, rehearse your strengths, and put the power to use as the economy re-opens.\n\nRelated: 10 Inspirational Quotes From Navy SEAL Training", "author": ["Cheryl Snapp Conner"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/RzrZfWe1ko4/348075", "published": "2020-05-20T19:00:00", "title": "5 Social Skills Every Entrepreneur Needs to Master", "text": "May 20, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWhen I was younger, if I had to give a presentation at school, I\u2019d barely sleep the night before.

How about you? Imagine how much more successful you could be with better communication skills.\n\nThat\u2019s why I started Talking The Talk. Most of us are never taught social skills like proper , accurate self-expression, how to deal with personal or professional rejection, or even how to quiet those anxious thoughts we feel when we\u2019re about to talk in front of a group.\n\nNow, those skills are more critical than ever. Let's take a look at a few actionable takeaways from our latest social skills checklist.\n\n1. Reframe your anxiety as excitement.\n\nDr. Amy Cuddy, an executive education teacher at Harvard University, wrote about this phenomenon in her New York Times bestselling book Presence.\n\nShe says \u201cby simply reframing the meaning of the emotion we\u2019re experiencing -- by nudging ourselves from anxiety to excitement -- we shift our psychological orientation, harnessing the cognitive and physiological resources we need to succeed under pressure. We effectively transform our stage fright into stage presence.\u201d\n\nSo, the next time you\u2019re feeling anxious before sharing your message, give yourself a nudge, and reframe your anxiety as excitement.\n\n2. Listen, don\u2019t pseudo-listen.\n\nWe think we know what it means to listen. When we\u2019re hearing urgent news, we ask clarifying questions. We paraphrase. We shift our eyes and bodies towards whoever is speaking and away from distractions. We give our full, undivided attention. But sometimes we think we\u2019re listening when we\u2019re really:\n\nSparring, debating, or disagreeing\n\nComparing or passing judgment\n\nRushing to find a character flaw\n\nThinking of your next response\n\nFiltering or listening only for what you want to hear\n\nThe problem with all of these listening alternatives is that there\u2019s no real benefit to be had -- for the speaker or for you, the intended listener. One side isn't heard, and you, the listener, aren't informed or challenged. This is how the stage for miscommunication is set. Be conscious of when you're pseudo-listening, so you can correct it and refocus.\n\nRelated: By Listening To Her Customers, This Entrepreneur Found a Larger Audience -- And a Greater Mission\n\n3. Make your inner thoughts clear.\n\nNobel prize winner George Bernard Shaw once said that \u201cthe single biggest problem with communication is the illusion it\u2019s taken place.\u201d Proper communication skills are essential for leaders and entrepreneurs, and even more so during times of uncertainty. It's what keeps everybody together, while dysfunctional leaves teams fragmented and misaligned.\n\nHere's how to make sure you're properly communicating:\n\nBe immediate, direct, and clear about your thoughts and feelings.\n\nDon\u2019t let negative (or positive) feedback simmer; speak up now.\n\nFocus on being heard, not provoking, calling other parties to arms.\n\nDon\u2019t send mixed messages; align your words and tone of voice.\n\nDistinguish between facts and your feelings about a situation.\n\n4. Focus on what you say and how you say it.\n\nDid you know communication is only 7 percent verbal? Meanwhile, 38 percent is nested in your vocal delivery, like articulation, pitch, and tone. And, much like the moon on the tides, vocal delivery exerts a hidden power on what you say and can turn your ordinary speech into an incantation.\n\nBelieve in yourself. You\u2019re not an imposter. You deserve to be here.\n\nBreathe and speak from your diaphragm, not your chest or throat.\n\nDon\u2019t speak with your mouth shut. Open up your body and mouth.\n\nGround yourself with an erect posture and plant yourself firmly.\n\nDon\u2019t be afraid to use your hands and gestures to add emphasis.\n\nRelated: Good Communication Can Save Your Brand During Quarantine\n\n5. Speak slower and embrace the silence.\n\nWilliam S. Burroughs, the second Commandant of the Marine Corps from 1798 until 1804, once said that \u201csilence is only frightening to people who are compulsively verbalizing.\u201d Yet most people fear silence. Fear not. Instead, embrace it and leverage it to drive your point home.\n\nMuch like the first tip on reframing anxiety as excitement, step into silence with confidence. Remember the following:\n\nSpeaking fast can make you seem nervous or anxious, and will undercut your message.\n\nUse the silence as a time to compose yourself, collect your thoughts, and continue speaking.\n\nTake it as a time to listen, ask clarifying questions, and increase your understanding.\n\nTo summarize, it's okay to be anxious or nervous before sharing news. If you didn't care, you wouldn't feel that way. But reframe that anxiety as excitement, and into an opportunity to be strong.\n\nChallenge yourself by listening attentively, so you can expand your understanding of the facts -- and remember, people who never listen never learn. And, when it's time to speak, speak your mind with clarity.\n\nPrepare beforehand if need be, and focus equally on what you're saying and how you're saying it to maximize impact and retention.

I know I\u2019m not alone in that sentiment. Watching the ESPN documentary of Michael Jordan in my basement is good, but not great. I want to play again, and soon. The inability to play or immerse myself in live sports right now, however, has made me reflect on the role ice hockey had on my life and the lessons I learned on watered-down, frozen soccer-fields-turned-hockey-rinks, seeing the sun go down and the temperature plunge further and further, until all senses were dulled to the point of nothingness.\n\nI spent my formative years in Edina, Minnesota, an ice hockey mecca, where I lived and breathed the sport September through July. As a goaltender, I thrived on my own in the net \u2014 the chance to be the hero or the goat on each occasion. In thinking more closely about it, goalies live with the fundamental challenges inherent in entrepreneurship: forced to make real-time decisions with often incomplete information, solving for probabilities and strategies outside of their immediate control, even the simple mental and physical spatial isolation inherent in the position itself. The best NHL goalies of my era \u2014 Felix Potvin, Marty Brodeur, Patrick Roy \u2014 were true innovators. They combined deeply ingrained muscle memory refined through daily repetition with an innate, instinctual ability to alter the game in a split second with the mere synapse of reflex. At the end of the day, nothing fazes the best goaltenders. Or, at least, you\u2019d rarely know it. Man, I wanted to be like them.\n\nRelated: What Entrepreneurs Can Learn From Pro Hockey\n\nThinking on my off-ice career to-date, I was behaving like an entrepreneur before I had the guts to call myself one. Until I took the plunge, I didn\u2019t think I had it in me to build a company. I am the son of an ex-Naval Officer turned Procter & Gamble Brand Manager \u2014 a key cog in the blue-chip of blue-chip consumer companies. If anyone was supposed to follow the rigorous, best-practice mindset of the times, it was me. But it wasn't for me. And, not uncommon for athletes, it was in the world of sports that I began to find my true self. It was goaltending that taught me to be comfortable with the unknown and gave me a lot of the tools necessary to lead a team through hurdles, heartbreaks and victories.\n\nThe global pandemic is uncharted territory for us all. It\u2019s so much more than an isolated hurdle. And no matter how much we\u2019ve planned or trained, it\u2019s virtually impossible to be fully prepared for what we are all facing. But I\u2019ve found clarity and strength by channeling the goaltending mentality: practical yet strategic, calculating and calm, intense yet focused, fearless and brave. I am doing it for my team and for my family. It\u2019s not easy. It\u2019s non-stop trial and error, but that mental training and toughness I learned growing up playing in preparation for \u201cthe show\u201d is something I will never forget. It\u2019s in my DNA. Especially now, in this unprecedented time, tapping into that goalie mentality has never been more challenging and, also, more important than ever.\n\nHere are some netminder strategies I recommend any entrepreneur practice during this challenging time:\n\n1. Own the \u201cgoalie mentality\u201d\n\nTh goalie mentality is a \u201cmake $1 work like $3\u201d owner-operator approach. A goalie is practical yet strategic.\n\nWhether your company is employee-owned or not, adopting the owner-operator approach will serve everyone well. A few years back, I learned the phrase \u201cmake $1 work like $3\u201d from Under Armour Founder, Kevin Plank. It was all over the office; even taped to the printers. It was born from the company\u2019s humble entrepreneurial beginnings and, as we grew, helped employees connect with the business roots as if they were an owner, as if every $1 spent was 3X more valuable \u2014 because it was theirs.\n\nAt my company, I\u2019ve embedded this mindset into our core being, which has taken on added emphasis due to the changing landscape of Covid-19. For example, we haven\u2019t stopped spending, but are putting even more emphasis on the question \u201cwould we bet our paychecks on this,\u201d especially considering everyone at Aloha is, in fact, an owner. We approach every obstacle or opportunity with a \u201cshould we do this right now, all things considered\u201d lens. If we don\u2019t think we\u2019ll be irreparably harmed by not pursuing a particular action this very moment, we take a breath and bench it for a shift, just like we would using our own paycheck.\n\nRelated: 10 Entrepreneurial Lessons From the Movie 'Miracle'\n\n2. Go Spartan\n\nGoalie mentality is \u201cspartan\u201d in approach and attitude. A goalie is calculating and calm.\n\nThe go big or go home mentality is really risky right now. Profitability matters. Free cash flow is king. A spartan approach is not sexy but it sure is effective. Look, that doesn\u2019t mean stop spending; rather ensure you have a specific payback period, protect your margins and monitor your KPIs religiously. Like March Madness, \u201cSurvive and Advance.\u201d The best goalies are the ones always putting themselves in the best position in the net to stop the highest probability of shots.\n\nWe\u2019re still making investments. We\u2019re accelerating business with an already rapid ascension; we need to keep moving forward. But instead of making bigger bets, we make tons of smaller ones. They come in all forms, some backed by case studies or benchmarks, some simply made by gut and experience. But they are all evaluated in some form or another; after we pull the trigger, we correct the course as we go. As entrepreneurs, great opportunities rarely wait for spreadsheets and committee-based analysis. But, we always reserve the right to get smarter and pull back, redeploy our resources, and attack again in a new way. Calm and calculating.\n\n3. Work the problem\n\nGoalie mentality is to single-mindedly attack the problem at hand. A goalie is intense yet focused.\n\nNext to cash, our most precious resource is our energy. Use it and spend it wisely with intention, on the things you must get done \u2014 the things in which you must be excellent. There are sometimes hundreds of tasks to do at any given point. Step back to make sure the most important ones happen, not just the most urgent. Reaffirm reality and prioritize simplicity with small, incremental steps.\n\nThe retail and shopper landscape has changed for the foreseeable future. Period. But I am challenging my team to embrace new opportunities hatching from this shift with clarity of purpose. We are becoming more shopper-centric and investing in more omnichannel platforms to meet the shopper where they currently are (e.g. stuck in their house). We have great tasting foods but no ability to market them in-person to our audiences. So we focused on a solution \u2014 partner with a trusted provider like SnackNation to deliver bars and drinks to their audiences this summer. When in-store retail opportunities vanished, we quickly added cohesive digital overlays that could function just as easily to incentivize trial.\n\n4. Protect and lead\n\nGoalie mentality is to never stop leading by example. A goalie \u201clives in the moment\u201d \u2014 fearless and brave.\n\nCompanies that pull an ostrich and don\u2019t deal with reality on almost brutally honest terms are likely to be irreparably harmed. This danger cannot be understated. You need to stay responsive, connected, identify and rework every problem, and embrace new approaches \u2014 especially omnichannel ones. During a crisis, bravery comes in dealing with reality.\n\nRelated: The Journey From Professional Hockey Player to Franchisee\n\nFacing reality is aided by massive over-communication. We over-communicate with everyone. A supply shortage that will delay a retailer by weeks? We deal with it, tell them, and adjust our plan accordingly.

We let our suppliers know we need time, and we let our employees know what\u2019s going on so we don\u2019t incur extra costs.

But the road to get there is a difficult one, filled with bumps and bruises \u2014 and the occasional concussion. I learned this in a hard and painful way. My stint as a pro wrestler was short, but I learned a lot of valuable lessons in the process.\n\nMy journey to pro wrestling\n\nThe larger-than-life characters of pro wrestling have always intrigued me. In 2009, I decided to attend a pro wrestling school. At 5'4\u201d and 135 pounds, I thought I fit the part. I saw an ad on Craigslist for a local wrestling try-out. I knew wrestling was choreographed, and I had learned dancing and singing choreography in high school when I was in the show choir. That counts as experience, right?\n\nRelated: WWE Superstar Mandy Rose on Building Her Body, Business and Future\n\nI drove to an auditorium-style venue called The Phantasy, a gritty concert venue usually reserved for metal and punk bands. I saw a wrestling ring set up in the front row and about 10-15 guys standing around. One guy was small like me, maybe even a few inches shorter, but more muscular. Another guy looked like a lumberjack, about 300 pounds. With his big beard and a big gut, he was quite impressive. There was one guy there who looked like a shorter, fatter hybrid of Stone Cold Steve Austin and Bill Goldberg.\n\nWe got started, and I found out quickly just how hard the ropes were. In this particular ring, the ropes were made of steel cables wrapped in electrical tape. Not exactly soft and inviting as they looked on TV.\n\nThe first drill was running the ropes with a partner. To the layman wresting observer, this probably looks easy. After all, what\u2019s so hard about running and bouncing off ropes? Believe me, the execution wasn\u2019t easy. When you run the ropes with another wrestler, you have to keep in sync so you don\u2019t crash into each other. I was exhausted at the end of the 60 seconds; the bruises underneath my shoulder blades slowly forming.\n\nI quickly realized that while I was in decent shape, I wasn\u2019t in wrestling shape. That realization led to my first lesson.\n\nLesson 1: It takes practice to be good\n\nRunning the ropes was something my favorite wrestlers on RAW did effortlessly. But I learned quickly that they had been running the ropes for years, and for countless hours, way before they were performing on Monday nights and on pay-per-views.\n\nThe thing is, we all have to \"run the ropes\" in some way or another in our careers. In my professional career as a copywriter, it\u2019s taken me years to get into \"copywriting\" shape. Sure, I\u2019ve been bouncing off the ropes with art directors and account managers for almost five years now, and my writing has improved since then, but it\u2019s a skill that I still have to hone daily.\n\nRelated: How a Mid-Size Wrestling Company Made Major Adjustments In the Empty-Arena Era\n\nLesson 2: Learn how to take a bump\n\nThe next, and probably most important step for any inspiring wrestler, is learning how to take a \"bump.\" A bump in when a wrestler lands solidly on their back with high impact, spread over as much surface as possible.\n\nBumps in wrestling are a painful learning experience. Everyone sucks when they start. You hit your head a million times, you land awkwardly, and then you get up and try it again. Like most skills, it\u2019s only improved through repetition.\n\nAbout three months into my pro wrestling training, we had a practice (practices were for three hours, two days a week) where we focused exclusively on bumping. With another wrestling student, I\u2019d bounce off the ropes, and lunge my right shoulder into his right shoulder. In wrestling terms, it\u2019s called a shoulder tackle-bump.\n\nThese drills move at a breakneck pace. You deliver a shoulder tackle-bump, then take a shoulder tackle-bump, then do it all over. You\u2019re up, you\u2019re down, and you\u2019re trying to keep the match moving. After the drill, I was exhausted, but I left practice feeling pretty good.\n\nLesson 3: Know your limits\n\nSeven hours after practice ended, I woke up in bed, and the room was spinning. I was foggy, queasy, and mostly scared. What was happening? Somehow, I managed to jump in the shower and get dressed for work. Yes, I had an office job during the day. About a mile into my commute, I knew something wasn\u2019t right. I was experiencing mild vertigo. I turned around and drove home.\n\nI went to a neurologist who told me what I already knew -- I had a mild concussion. When I told him what caused it, he smiled, nodded, and said, \u201cMy son plays college hockey, and I can\u2019t wait until he\u2019s done. He\u2019s gotten a couple of concussions. I would tell you the same I\u2019d tell my son. If you have better -- and safer -- career options, quit wrestling.\u201d\n\nI\u2019d pushed myself to my limits. Per the doctor\u2019s order, my time in the ring was done.\n\nRelated: Dwayne Johnson and Dany Garcia's Business Strategy: Rethink Everything!\n\nLesson 4: Never forget the basics\n\nIt\u2019s been 10 ten years since I stepped in the ring, but running the ropes and bumping are two of the hardest things I ever did. Today, I have a greater appreciation for sports entertainers and what they put their bodies through.\n\nEven though WrestleMania is the biggest spectacle in sports, there\u2019s a good chance these superstars started in the same dingy gyms and venues that I did.\n\nMy wrestling career might have been short-lived, but I learned a lot of valuable lessons that I continue to take with me today. Here are a few that have carried over from the squared ring to the squared cubicle.\n\nis a two-way dance. My wrestling instructor would always stress that the most important job a wrestler had when entering the ring was making sure the person you were wrestling with was able to go home to their families after the match.\n\nWrestling involves some serious and . And when you have that trust, chances are you\u2019re able to produce good matches (or in my case today, good copywriting).\n\nRecognize the work upfront. I never wrestled in front of a live audience -- one of my life\u2019s regrets -- but when I did watch my classmates perform at shows, I had a greater appreciation of the countless hours put in before the match.\n\nMost of us want to get ideas and projects off the ground immediately. Have a little with the research and insights that may go into your next presentation or pitch. There\u2019s a lot of late nights that go into the main event.\n\nKeep runnin\u2019 and bumpin\u2019. Before Hulk Hogan body slammed Andre The Giant, or The Undertaker threw Mankind off a steel cage, they were practicing how to get the basics down. This was so they wouldn\u2019t get hurt and wouldn\u2019t hurt their opponent.\n\nYou might not make it into the ring at WrestleMania, but hopefully, now you realize there\u2019s nothing \"fake\" at all about taking pride in your craft.", "author": ["Josh Womack"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/fiKojeVJ1Kc/350891", "published": "2020-05-20T16:04:14", "title": "'Facebook Shops' Lets You Shop Your Favorite Stores From the Social Network's App", "text": "May 20, 2020 4 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on PCMag\n\n\n\nThe pandemic is pushing Facebook to try turning itself into a virtual shopping mall for your favorite stores.\n\nFacebook Shops, introduced Tuesday, will let businesses sell their products directly to users on Facebook and Instagram. For users, this means you\u2019ll be able to browse and buy products within those apps instead of being re-directed to a third-party store.\n\n\u201cThis is the biggest step we have taken yet to enable commerce across our apps,\u201d Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg said during a live stream. \u201cThe basic idea here is that any small business can easily start a shop across our apps to sell things directly.\u201d\n\nImage credit: Facebook\n\nTo find applicable shops, you\u2019ll have to visit a business\u2019s Facebook Page, and see if it has a \u201cShop Now\u201d button activated. On Instagram, you can go to a business's profile page and look for the \"View Shop\" button.\n\nFacebook is betting that many businesses will want to create virtual storefronts on the social network, especially in light of COVID-19, which is keeping consumers away from brick-and-mortar shops. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a lot of small businesses that never had online presences get online for the first time,\u201d Zuckerberg said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t going to make up for all of the lost business, but it can help.\u201d\n\nSetting up a shop is free, but Facebook\u2019s Merchant agreements note that the company will take a 5 percent transaction fee on the sale of goods processed over its services. Ideally, businesses getting a sales boost from their virtual storefronts will also entice them to buy more ads. \u201cThe vast majority of our advertisers are small businesses, and they also make up the biggest part of our revenue,\u201d Zuckerberg added.\n\nImage credit: Facebook\n\nAds are also another way businesses will be able to sell products directly to users within Facebook\u2019s apps. Users will be able to click on the ads and be taken to the merchant\u2019s Facebook Shop.\n\n\"Shops are native and fast, which means no more app-switching to a slow mobile web browser where you have to reenter your credit card when you tap on an interesting product you see in feeds,\" Zuckerberg said in a separate post.\n\nOn the backend, the company is making Facebook Shops easy to integrate with existing e-commerce platforms including Shopify, BigCommerce, and ChannelAdvisor, which are already helping small businesses sell online.\n\nAlthough Facebook Shops may provide some much-needed relief for struggling businesses, what does this all mean for user privacy? During the live stream, Zuckerberg said: \u201cWe\u2019re not going to share what you buy with friends or anyone else and our services without your permission.\u201d\n\nHowever, the company itself will use your activity on Facebook Shops \u201cto personalize your experience on our apps and show you more relevant content, including ads,\u201d the social network explained in an FAQ. \u201cThis means your activity across our apps may influence what you see in Shops, and your activity in Shops may influence what you see elsewhere on Facebook and Instagram. For example, if you look through collections of bicycles in Shops, you might see more content, including ads, about bicycles in feed, stories, Explore, and other places across our apps.\u201d\n\nThe company is rolling out Facebook Shops today, with plans to make it more widely available in the coming months. This summer in the US, Facebook is also set on introducing Instagram Shop, which promises to help users easily discover new products to buy directly over the app. That builds on Instagram's experiment last year to begin letting select brands buy products directly in the app\n\n\"You can get inspired by collections from @shop, browse selections from your favorite brands and creators, filter by categories like beauty and home, and purchase the looks you love all in one place,\" the company said. \"And later this year, we\u2019re adding a new shop tab in the navigation bar, so you can get to Instagram Shop in just one tap.\"\n\nIn time, you\u2019ll also be able to make purchases directly from businesses on WhatsApp, Facebook Messenger and Instagram\u2019s direct messaging function.", "author": ["Michael Kan"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/NWo4JAzEaT4/350774", "published": "2020-05-20T16:00:00", "title": "5 Tips for Hiring and Team Building Remotely", "text": "May 20, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe entire world changed in a few short weeks this spring. A global health crisis catalyzed an economic recession, and uncertainty began impacting entrepreneurs and startups everywhere. As a startup founder, I\u2019ve seen firsthand the importance of finding innovative ways to adapt your business to new situations, while continuing to have a \u201cpeople-first\u201d mentality.\n\nI run a company that helps people assess their insurance options. Prior to the pandemic, we planned to double in size by the end of this year, and we're lucky that we're still on track to meet that goal. But for anyone fortunate enough to be right now, we've discovered that recruiting and onboarding on new talent is a whole new reality, with a whole new set of considerations. We've pivoted our interviewing and hiring to be fully remote, and here are some lessons we learned along the way.\n\n1. Invest in your people first\n\nFrom both a hiring and retention perspective, supporting your existing team is a strategic function of your business. While every startup\u2019s needs are different, you can \u2014 and should \u2014 prioritize creating a positive experience for current and potential employees to attract the best new talent.\n\nRelated: Hiring Remote Workers? Here's What to Consider First.\n\n2. Utilize shared resources\n\nCompanies across the world are dealing with change at an unprecedented pace. One estimate places the number of laid-off startup employees at more than 30,000 since March 11 \u2014 and that\u2019s just at startups. With so many people looking for work, regular reports are issued about companies still hiring during this outbreak. If you\u2019re hiring, reach out to relevant outlets to see how to add your company to these lists.\n\nIt\u2019s also important to personally connect with your community, whether that\u2019s with your peer network, other companies in your city or checking out community boards. Doing this can help you crowdsource new resources, like opt-in layoff lists for talent, and give you an outlet to share challenges.\n\n3. Acknowledge (and adapt to) the human toll of this moment\n\nPeople are dealing with tremendous challenges, from parents juggling childcare responsibilities alongside full-time remote work to the general anxiety that prolonged isolation can bring. Rather than gloss over those realities, openly acknowledge them in interviews and onboarding.\n\nStudies on organizational transformation have found communication is the most important factor for success. Communicating right now may look different, but it\u2019s critical. Share regular updates with candidates and employees, early and often, even when you don\u2019t have all the answers. Candidates are now frequently asking how companies are dealing with COVID-19. Proactively share your organization\u2019s policies, so candidates feel a greater sense of certainty about your business. Encourage two-way dialogue, empowering people to ask questions and share concerns.\n\nRelated: What Nobody Tells You About Remote Work\n\n4. Create new experiences tailored for virtual life\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to fully recreate an in-person experience virtually, so it\u2019s important to adjust accordingly. Experts are noticing heightened \u201cvideo-call fatigue,\u201d a feeling that virtual meetings are more exhausting than in-person meetings due to nonverbal overload. If you can extend your interview process over a few days to give interviewers a break, do it. Scheduling is easier now, as commute times and overbooked conference rooms have evaporated. To add a welcome atmosphere, consider having a candidate's recruiter join their video interview for a few minutes early to help test out their technology and answer any logistical questions, similar to how someone might greet them at the door if they were interviewing in-person. Make sure candidates meet a group of their future coworkers \u2014 since no matter where you\u2019re working from, it\u2019s the people who truly define company culture.\n\n5. Connect with each other and share the laughs\n\nFor a new employee who\u2019s never met the team in-person, creating an early sense of psychological safety is incredibly important. To assist with building that bond, prioritize opportunities to integrate new team members from day one.\n\nConsider implementing engagement opportunities like casual \u201cworking sessions\u201d that replicate an in-office atmosphere. For example, we\u2019ve set up group virtual coffee meetings and designed fun new activities, like a \u201cBring Your Kids to Work\" show-and-tell session to keep employees engaged and experiencing social connections even while physically separated. We also instituted regular office hours to support our employees and a bi-weekly company survey to understand how employees are feeling and how we can better support them.\n\nUltimately, this is a universal time of change and adjustment, and things won\u2019t always go smoothly. From shipping disruptions that make it challenging to get tech equipment to new hires before their first day, to the devastating human impact of this crisis, the ramifications of COVID-19 are wide-ranging and here to stay for a while. But in the middle of all of this, there\u2019s still opportunity for growth, innovation and some much-needed laughs with your team.\n\nRelated: These 50 Companies Are Growing and Hiring Remotely Right Now", "author": ["Jennifer Fitzgerald"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/KyzvR4ePXIo/350889", "published": "2020-05-20T15:41:45", "title": "14 Tips for Safe Online Shopping", "text": "May 20, 2020 9 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Engadget\n\n\n\nThere's every reason in the world to shop online. The bargains are there. The selection is mind-boggling. The shopping is secure. Shipping is fast. Even returns are easy, with the right e-tailers. Shopping has never been easier or more convenient for consumers. And in the age of COVID, it's safer than going out even if you're fully masked and gloved.\n\nBut what about the bad guys? It happens. The FBI's own Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) says the number one cybercrime of 2019 in half the 50 states was related to online shopping: non-payment for or non-deliver of goods purchased.\n\nStay calm. While somewhat alarming, these stats should not keep you from shopping online. You simply need to use some common sense and follow practical advice. Here are basic guidelines; use them and you can shop with confidence.\n\nUse familiar websites\n\nStart at a trusted site. Search results can be rigged to lead you astray, especially when you drift past the first few pages of links. If you know the site, chances are it's less likely to be a rip-off. We all know Amazon.com carries everything under the sun; likewise, just about every major retail outlet has an online store, from Target to Best Buy to Home Depot. Beware of misspellings or sites using a different top-level domain (.net instead of .com, for example) \u2014 those are the oldest tricks in the book. Yes, sales on these sites might look enticing, but that's how they trick you into giving up your info. (Photo by Quinn Rooney/Getty Images)\n\nLook for the lock\n\nNever buy anything online using your credit card from a site that doesn't have SSL (secure sockets layer) encryption installed \u2014 at the very least. You'll know if the site has SSL because the URL for the site will start with HTTPS \u2014 instead of just HTTP. An icon of a locked padlock will appear, typically to the left of the URL in the address bar or the status bar down below; it depends on your browser. HTTPS is standard now even on non-shopping sites, enough that Google Chrome flags any page without the extra S as \"not secure.\" So a site without it should stand out even more.\n\nDon't overshare\n\nNo online shopping e-tailer needs your Social Security number or your birthday to do business. However, if crooks get them and your credit card number, they can do a lot of damage. The more scammers know, the easier it is to steal your identity. When possible, default to giving up as little personal data as possible. Major sites get breached all the time.\n\nBlur yourself online\n\n4.5\n\nEDITORS' CHOICE\n\nAbine's Blur is a browser add-on that acts as a basic password manager and oh so much more. For $39 a year, it'll let you shop without revealing anything about your actual self \u2014 no emails, phone numbers or even credit card numbers. It's one of the most impressive online privacy solutions we've ever seen. Read our full review.\n\nCreate strong passwords\n\nWe once asked PCMag readers if they frequently changed their passwords. Eleven percent claimed they did it every day, but those people are either paranoid, liars, or paranoid liars. The vast majority only change a password to protect privacy a few times a year (27 percent) or more likely, never (35 percent).\n\nIf you're going to be like the latter group, we will again beat this dead horse about making sure that you utilize uncrackable passwords. It's never more important than when banking and shopping online. Our old tips for creating a unique password can come in handy during a time of year when shopping around probably means creating new accounts on e-commerce sites.\n\nEven your perfect password isn't perfect. The smarter move: use a password manager to create uncrackable passwords for you. It will keep track of them and enter them, so you don't have to think about it.\n\nCheck statements regularly\n\nDon't wait for your bill to come at the end of the month. Go online regularly, especially during the holiday season, to view electronic statements for your credit card, debit card, and checking accounts. Look for any fraudulent charges, even originating from payment sites like PayPal and Venmo. (After all, there's more than one way to get to your money.)\n\nYou should definitely only buy online with a credit card. If your debit card is compromised, scammers have direct access to your bank funds. Any seller that wants a different kind of payment, like wired money, is a big red flag. The Fair Credit Billing Act ensures that if you get scammed, you are only responsible for up to $50 of credit card charges you didn't authorize. There are protections even if you're not happy with a purchase you did make.\n\nIf you see something wrong, pick up the phone to address the matter quickly. In the case of credit cards, pay the bill only when you know all your charges are accurate. You have 30 days to notify the bank or card issuer of problems, however; after that, you might be liable for the charges anyway.\n\nInoculate your computer\n\nSwindlers don't sit around waiting for you to give them data; sometimes they give you a little something extra to help things along. You need to protect against malware with regular updates to your antivirus program. Better yet, pay for a full-blown security suite, which will have antivirus software, but also will fight spam, spear-phishing emails, and phishing attacks from websites (the latter two try and steal your personal info by mimicking a message or site that looks legit). Remember, it's not enough to have it installed. Make sure your anti-malware tools are always up to date. Otherwise, they can let in any new threats \u2014 and there are always new threats.\n\nPrivatize your Wi-Fi\n\nIf you're shopping via a public hotspot, stick to known networks, even if they're free, like those found at Starbucks or Barnes & Noble stores. Any of the providers in our roundup of the Fastest Free Nationwide Wi-Fi can generally be trusted, but you should probably also use a virtual private network (VPN) to be safe (here's why).\n\nFor more, read our Tips for Public Wi-Fi Hotspot Security.\n\nAvoid shopping in public\n\nWhat about using your own laptop to shop while you're out? It's one thing to hand over a credit card to get swiped at the checkout, but when you have to enter the credit card number and expiration date and 3-digit code on the back into a shopping site while sitting in a public cafe, you're giving an over-the-shoulder snooper plenty of time to see the goods. Think like a gangster: Sit in the back, facing the door. Use sites that you trust that already have your credit card stored, so you don't have to pull it out for more than a latte. Better yet: stay home when online shopping.\n\nThink mobile\n\nThere's no real need to be any more nervous about shopping on a mobile device than online. Simply use apps provided directly by the retailers, like Amazon and Target, even McDonalds or Chipotle. Use the apps to find what you want and then make the purchase directly, without going to the store or the website.\n\nSkip the card, use the phone\n\nPaying for items using your smartphone is pretty standard these days in brick-and-mortar stores, and is actually even more secure than using your credit card. Using a mobile payment app like Apple Pay generates a one-time-use authentication code for the purchase that no one else could ever steal and use. Plus, you're avoiding card skimmers \u2014 hell, you don't even need to take your credit card with you if you only go places that accept phone-based payments. How does that matter if you're online shopping? Many a phone app will now accept payment using Apple Pay and Google Pay. You just need your fingerprint, face, or passcode to make it happen instantly.\n\nCount the cards\n\nWhen it comes to gift cards, stick to the source when you buy one; scammers like to auction off gift cards on sites like eBay with little or no funds on them. There are many gift card \"exchanges\" out there that are a great idea \u2014 letting you trade away cards you don't want for the cards that you do \u2014 but you can't trust everyone else using such a service. You might get a card and find it's already been used. Make sure the site you're using has a rock-solid guarantee policy. Better yet, simply go directly to a retail brick-and-mortar store to get the physical card.\n\nCheck the seller\n\nIf you're wary of a site, perform your due diligence. The Better Business Bureau has an online directory and a scam tracker. Yelp and Google are full of retailer reviews. Put companies through the wringer before you plunk down your credit card number. There's a reason that non-delivery/non-payment is the most common cybercrime complaint: it hurts when that happens, financially and emotionally.\n\nThat said \u2014 online reviews can be gamed. If you see nothing but positive feedback and can't tell if the writers are legitimate customers, follow your instincts.\n\nIf nothing else, make absolutely sure you've got a concrete address and a working phone number for the seller. If things go bad, you have a place to take your complaint. In fact, call them before you order so you can clarify a return policy and where to go with any issues after the purchase.\n\nComplain loud and proud\n\nDon't be embarrassed if you get taken for a ride while online shopping. Instead, get very, very mad. Complain to the seller. If you don't get satisfaction, report it to the Federal Trade Commission, your state's attorney general, even the FBI. That's probably going to work best if you buy in the US, rather than with foreign sites. If you're going to get scammed, try to get scammed locally ... or at least domestically.", "author": ["Eric Griffith"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/nN6LZyHAfgs/350888", "published": "2020-05-20T15:36:00", "title": "Spotify Snags Joe Rogan's Podcast as Its Latest Exclusive", "text": "May 20, 2020 3 min read\n\nThis story originally appeared on Engadget\n\n\n\nSpotify has added another major podcast to its audio war chest: The Joe Rogan Experience.

There are myriad reasons why it\u2019s not even close, but here are just a few that stand out: I'm assuming there are no prison riots in your home; you don\u2019t have to worry about getting shanked while you sleep; you don\u2019t have house correctional officers raiding your bedroom looking for contraband; you can use the bathroom at your leisure (what an amazing luxury); and most of you probably have cold, clean drinking water. I can go on, from food not made for human consumption to no daylight to shackles on your feet and hands when moving units.\n\nSo, while quarantine can totally suck, you\u2019re still not quite in prison. Plus, there are a million ways to use your time wisely while dealing with the lockdown. And, please don\u2019t let my sarcasm take away from my empathy towards the current situation though. No matter the scenario, nobody wants to stay locked up in a confined space all day every day. I feel you on that.\n\nYou\u2019re probably wondering: Well, what makes you an expert? \u201cWell, Jim,\u201d as a young man, I went to prison and was institutionalized more times than I like to admit and have learned these invaluable life and business lessons by intimately experiencing the great challenges of life in lockup. Yes, yay me! You can read more about my life story on my website. I also wrote a comedy book about prison called Don\u2019t Drop the Soap that shares some life hacks, workout and even food recipes. Go check it out if you want a good read during quarantine.\n\nRelated: Managing Your Company Culture Virtually\n\nIn prison, inmates focus daily on something they refer to as their \"program,\" which is essentially their daily routine. It is the backbone of a successful prison term, because it keeps you focused and active. Most inmates live and die by their program, and as a freshly minted quarantine-ee, I recommend you do the same.\n\nHere are my 10 OG quarantine tips.\n\n1. Learn a new skill\n\nWhile I was in prison, I taught myself how to build websites using my #2 pencil, textbooks and a notepad, so I don\u2019t want to hear your excuses. (I even have a course you can take.) This is a great time to learn a new skill to make a bunch of money, expand your mental capacity or to make the best use of your time.\n\n2. Read daily\n\nOver the course of two years in prison, I read well over 300 books. Reading keeps your mind sharp, expands your imagination and improves your vernacular. Even fiction has its place, especially in a confined space. What are you reading currently? I\u2019d love to hear. Send me your list on Twitter @andrewmedal.\n\n3. Write daily\n\nAs entrepreneurs and leaders, we must always strive to be the best communicators and learn how to clearly articulate our messages and words. In prison, your written word becomes your voice on the outside while being cut off from other communication means (like in-person communication, emails, calls, texts, etc.). Writing daily in prison had a profound effect on how much stronger I communicated, in all areas of my life, upon my release. If you don\u2019t know what to write, keep a daily journal of your thoughts, ideas and feelings. Start writing and set dedicated time aside each day.\n\n4. Work out daily\n\nYou don\u2019t have weights? Who cares! Body-weighted workouts can destroy you and get you super-ripped. Plus, the dopamine and discipline you\u2019ll reap from working out far outweigh the physical benefits, especially as an entrepreneur.\n\n5. Connect with your higher power\n\nHarvard research studies of meditation have shown benefits against an array of physical and mental conditions, including anxiety, depression and post-traumatic stress disorder. The most \"woke\" people I\u2019ve personally ever met in my life are inmates doing life in prison, most of whom have dedicated their life to daily meditation or some form of spiritual connection. There\u2019s something about captivity that reminds you how insignificant the human species is and how there must be more to life. It is also the secret formula for living with empathy and looking outside of yourself, which is much needed in our modern society.\n\n6. Get a side hustle\n\nThe underlying fabric of the inmate prison system sits atop an unbreakable entrepreneurial foundation. Every single inmate in prison has a hustle. That hustle can be the yard\u2019s tattoo artist, the laundry guy, the sports bookie, the yard chef and a million others both legal and not so legal (I mean, it is a prison, so what do you expect?). Side hustles on the outside are all the rave, and this is the perfect time to do it. The quickest way to create a side hustle is to monetize your skills and hobbies. For example, if you like to write in your downtime, create a content agency, or if you have a passion for baking, start selling your baked goods to friends and neighbors. A side hobby can net you an extra couple of bucks per month, and everyone loves extra money. I share tons of side hobby ideas on my Instagram account, so go connect with me there @andrewmedal!\n\n7. Find a new hobby\n\nThe prison yard is full of hobbies, from drawing to working out, chess, reading, handball and playing cards 24-7. Inmates are unfortunately forced to pass the time, but it becomes a nice way to escape their current circumstances. This is a great way for you to do the same. One of mine and my wife's new favorite hobby is playing cards after dinner once we put our newborn baby girl down for bed. We\u2019ll even throw in a little bit of cash in the pot for bragging rights. This new hobby has been something we look forward to all day and provides a fun way to escape and bond.\n\n8. Learn a new language\n\nIf you\u2019re looking to improve your memory, your decision-making ability and overall cognitive health, you better dust off that \u2018ol Espanol dos libro and get to studying. Prison language is a dialect unto its own, and as a fresh fish, if you want to survive without getting gutted, you better learn how to communicate with the other inmates fast. I previously wrote a useful article titled \"13 Prison Slang Terms You Should Use with Co-Workers\" for anyone wanting to learn some handy prison slang. And instead of using with coworkers, you can use it with your quarantine mates and on Zoom calls.\n\n9. Share stories\n\nSharing stories in prison is almost a rite of passage. Inmates gather around the yard sharing their most epic stories from the streets. Sharing stories is an amazing way to entertain, teach, and learn about one another. As a species, our culture has been built on storytelling and this is an incredibly useful skill to build as an entrepreneur. Storytelling can help you raise capital, gain new customers, and create brand loyalty. We live in the attention economy and there\u2019s no better way to gain an audience\u2019s attention than through a good story.\n\n10. Program.\n\nI spoke briefly about what programming in prison above and how it becomes the lifeline for every inmate and how they manage their day. Creating a consistent schedule and routine becomes the most effective way to do time. Programming teaches discipline, provides structure and is a super-useful productivity hack. I\u2019ve applied programming to my life as an entrepreneur and have reaped massive benefits in my ROI of time and energy. During quarantine, it can become too easy to just forget your normal routine and let the day run away.\n\nFor fun, here\u2019s also a quick hit list of things to avoid during a lockdown: uncontrollable gambling, drugs, treating quarantine like it\u2019s an extended spring break and excessive TV binging. Some of these vices are how inmates get into a wreck while doing their time, and you may as well learn from them what not to do too. Make the best of your quarantine time and come out of lockdown smarter, more jacked and with a side hustle.

They feel pressure from the invoices piling up or don\u2019t know what steps to take next. Actually, you can take action within the hour to save your business and come out on top by employing an emergency principle we learned as combat veterans in the military, and we use every single day to save businesses.\n\nIn a situation where you have to make decisions fast or people will die, triage is the practice of controlled chaos that allows you to use speed of knowledge and make a quick assessment of your resources to identify immediate next steps to save as many lives as possible.\n\nHere are 10 immediate business triage steps you can take to save your business.\n\n1. Be proactive\n\nYou won\u2019t get what you don't ask for, so ask for what you need and take massive action in every area of your business, from contacting creditors to extending your current products and services to fit these current times.\n\n2. Communicate with your customers and clients\n\nLet customers know what the status of your business is. Tell them about the efforts you\u2019re taking to get them your services or products as quickly as possible and reassure them that you're doing everything possible to serve them.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Recognizing a Meaningful Business Opportunity When You See One\n\n3. Take a debt holiday\n\nIf you need to, call all of your creditors and ask to freeze payments for six weeks or longer to save your company. If they push back, use this as your opportunity to negotiate a discount on an invoice or lower payment plan.\n\n4. Secure the value in your business\n\nBy securing the value in your business, you ensure creditors cannot access them should things turn sour. For example, if you own a construction company and you have $100,000 worth of equipment, transfer those assets to another legal entity that you set up (check with your accountant) and then lease it back to your construction company. This is a legal strategy of placing your assets into a different company and keeping it out of the hands of creditors.\n\nAs long as you don't have any litigation going on in a company right now, you can secure the value in your business this way. You can do the same thing for intellectual property. Businesses do this all the time under normal operating conditions.\n\nRelated: 4 Reliable Tips for Quickly Moving Inventory Online\n\n5. Put all employees on telework (where possible)\n\nAt the time of writing, most business owners must allow employees to work from home where possible. However, if this is not the case, identify which employees could continue their jobs at home and further mitigate the risk of contagion in your business.\n\n6. Collect debt (even when it\u2019s hard)\n\nMany people feel awful about collecting debt, even worse during this pandemic (and catastrophic events in general). You can do this tactfully by asking clients what they can pay every week, month, or quarter and get it set up. Offer a 10%-25% discount if they pay early or waive interest for a set period of time, you know your margins.\n\n7. Flip that line of credit\n\nA time like this is exactly what your line of credit is for. Lines of credit have higher interest rates, but you can call the bank and ask them to flip it into a long-term loan immediately. If they\u2019re willing to do so, you\u2019ll benefit from a lower interest rate and you might get to put a little bit of cash on top.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways to Find Opportunity in a Crisis\n\n8. Negotiate penalty freezes with the bank\n\nCall the bank and ask them to freeze penalty or late payment fees for the next several months.\n\n9. Build a robust cash flow plan\n\nTo keep this simple, open up a spreadsheet and create columns for each month for the next few months to a year. For each month, plug in all the payments you have coming in from your debtors and projected revenue from products or services. Then subtract everything you owe to your creditors. Sum it and see what your cash flow looks like at the end of each month.\n\nLook at the months when you have a shortfall. Move the creditor payments around until you\u2019re not negative at the bottom. If you can only make a certain payment three months from now, move it and call that creditor and see what you can negotiate. Typically, if you say there is no other way, they agree.\n\nRelated: How to Make Every Marketing Dollar Count During a Crisis\n\n10. Get rid of nonessential overhead\n\nYou\u2019ve probably built good business perks into your business, but your employees or customers can survive without them right now.

Uber and Lyft drivers have seen their incomes plunge as people shelter in place. Airbnb bookings have tumbled, and its services have been banned in some cities and states. Gig workers at a number of companies are protesting a lack of basic protections like hand sanitizer, cleaning supplies and sick pay.\n\nThis crisis has brought to a head problems that have been lurking in the wings for years. As a professor who researches the sharing economy, I\u2019ve found that the features that make it so successful \u2014 especially its flexible, decentralized, independent workforce \u2014 create both unique opportunities and vulnerabilities. The stresses of our current situation have made these contradictions clearer than ever.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Rebound After a Crisis\n\nWill this public health emergency push the sharing economy to evolve? Or will it throw the entire business model into question? The answer hinges on whether companies can adapt quickly and find ways to create a virtuous cycle of benefits for both workers and customers, as well as their bottom lines. Sharing economy giants like Uber and Airbnb have become so ubiquitous that their ability to survive will have serious implications for the economy as a whole.\n\nThe most innovative aspect of the sharing economy is a unique relationship between companies and their workers. Rather than hiring and managing a traditional workforce, these businesses create platforms for individuals to sell goods and services, from use of their cars and homes to their time and skills. An estimated one-third of U.S. workers are now engaged in \u201cgig work,\u201d much of it through sharing economy marketplaces.\n\nThe sharing economy\u2019s flexibility and low barriers to entry have long appealed to workers who can decide when and how much to work, or who want to pick up side hustles to earn extra income. Now, we may see people who have been laid off flock to gig work in an attempt to make ends meet, such as the 250,000 new users who signed up to work for Instacart during the first week of April.\n\nAt the same time, the tenuous relationship between sharing economy companies and their workers is showing signs of strain. Some frustrated Instacart workers have simply quit or switched to competing services like Postmates, while others are striking for safer working conditions. Though companies like Uber and Lyft are offering sick pay, many workers report trouble collecting benefits or meeting eligibility requirements.\n\nRelated: 10 Ways Startups Can Pivot From Growth to Operational Efficiency During a Crisis\n\nThese challenges reveal how precarious sharing economy jobs can be for workers, most of whom are classified as independent contractors. This means they are not guaranteed a steady income and often lack basic benefits like paid sick leave, health insurance and access to unemployment assistance. In recent years, gig workers at Uber and other companies have fought to be recognized as employees to obtain greater protections.\n\nThese ongoing concerns about the lack of security afforded by sharing economy jobs have boiled over during these trying times, resulting in highly publicized strikes and demands that companies better protect their workers. Policymakers are also getting involved, as states like Michigan and Colorado explore ways to help gig workers access unemployment benefits.\n\nA workforce of independent contractors poses challenges for companies too. Because these businesses are so decentralized, it is harder for them to control the behavior of workers and sellers across their platforms to ensure customers have a good experience. Airbnb, for example, has struggled in recent years to protect the safety of guests and hosts and faced backlash after a series of sexual assaults at its properties.\n\nRelated: 10 Lessons Every Entrepreneur Should Learn About Their Business\n\nThe current crisis has made the underlying problems of decentralization clearer than ever. Although Grubhub, Postmates, and other food delivery services have announced precautions such as contactless delivery, restaurants and consumers have little guarantee that drivers are following proper protocols. In an attempt to discourage risky public health behavior, Airbnb issued guidelines for how hosts represent their properties during the pandemic. Yet there are still listings encouraging people to \u201cQuarantine in Paradise!\u201d with friends or offering toilet paper as a perk.\n\nThis situation has laid bare some of the core contradictions of a sharing economy built on a decentralized, independent and often precarious workforce. Companies will have to adapt quickly to mount a cohesive response that satisfies customers and workers, both of whom are essential to their continued success. The flexibility built into the sharing economy model may be an asset for companies looking to innovate rapidly. Uber, for example, has encouraged struggling drivers to shift to its food delivery service Uber Eats.\n\nIn many cases, workers\u2019 demands for better protections might closely align with the interests of customers who are also concerned about their health. Previous research my colleagues and I conducted found a virtuous cycle on sharing economy platforms like Airbnb where good behavior from sellers induces better behavior from buyers, and vice versa. If companies can find a way to harness positive feedback loops around worker and customer safety, they may be able to secure the trust of both groups.\n\nThis logic also applies to protecting workers financially. Some sharing economy companies quickly realized that if they didn\u2019t offer some form of paid sick leave, they could be forcing workers into an impossible choice \u2014 \u201cstarvation or sickness \u201d \u2014 potentially putting customers at risk as a result. Particularly in competitive sectors like food delivery, visible failures to protect workers could concern customers and lead to (further) losses of revenue.\n\nThe government might also need to step in to ensure gig workers are protected. This crisis could be the tipping point that finally leads companies and policymakers to address the precarity of gig work by offering a better safety net including access to health and unemployment benefits, greater income stability and paid leave.\n\nThe sharing economy\u2019s ability to weather this storm will have broader impacts on the economy, given how thoroughly it has infiltrated our national and local markets and workforces. In a recent paper, my colleagues and I found that increased activity on home-sharing platforms like Airbnb boosted local restaurant revenue, often in areas outside traditional tourist districts. A downturn could have the opposite impact.\n\nLocal economies might also be affected as gig workers who\u2019ve lost income shift gears. For example, some hosts are converting their now-empty Airbnb properties into long-term rentals, potentially reversing a trend we uncovered in our previous research on Airbnb\u2019s impact on local rental housing markets.\n\nTo survive this pandemic, the sharing economy must address some of its underlying contradictions by ensuring the security of both workers and customers. Companies that are able to do so might even come out ahead if they can safely offer essential services like grocery delivery. However, if the sharing economy cannot deal with its fundamental vulnerabilities in a moment of crisis, it could spell the end of its meteoric rise as a business model.\n\nRelated: Uber to Riders and Drivers: Wear a Mask or Lose Access to App", "author": ["Davide Proserpio"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/nTu9eQmW3zY/347893", "published": "2020-05-19T15:45:00", "title": "Podcast Advertising: Is Programmatic the Next Big Thing?", "text": "May 19, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWith at least 150 million monthly listeners in the U.S. alone, it's no surprise that everyone from global brands to small businesses are turning to as their next key investment.\n\nAfter all, podcast ads are, for the most part, native \u2014 and native advertising can quickly turn an inbound trickle into a whole stream of new business. Indeed, podcast advertisements are seamlessly integrated into the natural flow of a show. Combine that with extremely engaged listeners and a personal touch added by the host, and voil\u00e0! You've got an excellent recipe for a highly effective advertising campaign on your hands.\n\nSo, what could be better?\n\nRelated: Want to Advertise Your Business on Podcasts? Here's How to Get Started.\n\nSay hello to programmatic podcast advertising\n\nWhen compared to a run-of-the-mill native podcast ad, the programmatic approach has a few distinct advantages right off the bat. It gives you a refined degree of control over your campaign. From geo-targeting to in-depth demographics to the device type and context, you can turn every proverbial dial to stack the odds of success in your favor. Though native advertising boasts authenticity, going the programmatic route allows you to ensure the relevance of your advertising. This helps you lay down the foundation for a successful campaign.\n\nAt the heart of the efforts to bring to businesses and podcasters across the globe stand only a few specialized companies, such as Audry. Unlike a podcast network or a hosting platform, programmatic podcast advertisers are fully focused on building the technology that will bring podcast advertising to the next level.\n\nRelated: The Social Selling System: Flipping a Follower into a Client\n\nRelevant, authentic and effective\n\nImagine the following scenario: It's a rainy morning in Chicago, and a young professional woman in her late 20s is on her way to work while listening to podcasts on her Android device. It's possible to target her directly \u2014 and that's only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to the degree of control programmatic podcast advertising offers.\n\nThis approach allows for the audio spot to be put together in real time, and then be tailored to any given audience and delivered right to the targeted listeners at the perfect moment, no unsolvable variables involved. You're able to take the already intimate experience that podcasts offer and integrate your advertising in a seamless and complementary manner rather than blasting the listeners with poorly crafted, poorly targeted and poorly timed invasive radio-style ads.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons to Add a Podcast to Your Content-Marketing Strategy\n\nLower attribution and true scale\n\nWhen it comes to assessing the success of your podcast advertising campaigns, coupon redemption is pretty much the holy grail among all of the available methods. But let's face it: Beyond how many people heard your ad and how many people redeemed a coupon, you have little to no relevant data to analyze.\n\nProgrammatic podcast advertising helps do away with this problem as well. You can go much further than baseline redemptions, getting insights on how many listeners there were on certain days, what episodes they listened to and what demographics they belong to, among a treasure trove of other rich and meaningful data.\n\nHaving access to this information is pretty much the key to beefing up your advertising and making sure that it's hitting the right people on all the right points.\n\nIt's no secret that native advertising is costly and is only really possible for the top fifth of the podcasts out there. And when we account for the fact that there are more than 1 million podcasts available to listeners on iTunes alone, the remaining 800,000 or so are left with little to no option to monetize their show.\n\nThe programmatic approach can come to the rescue yet again by enabling smaller shows to grow their reach and allowing advertisers to access cost-effective advertising geared toward a well-engaged and highly targeted niche-relevant audience.\n\nShould you take part?\n\nAs an emerging trend, programmatic podcast advertising is finding its foothold in today's increasingly digital world. But despite the fact that it's in its infancy, this approach to podcast advertising already has quite a number of advantages versus the more traditional native advertising. It's important to note that these advantages don't just exclusively apply to advertisers. Programmatic advertising helps empower both podcasters and prospective advertisers alike while delivering a far more fine-tuned and intimate advertising experience to the audience.\n\nWhen asked about the impact potential of programmatic podcast advertising, Niklas Hildebrand, the co-founder of Audry, said, \u201cNative advertising in podcasts used to outperform all other ad types on most performance metrics because targeting was very limited, and brands used aggressive radio style ads. With programmatic podcast advertising, this is no longer the case. The new generation of podcast ads are not only more targeted, but the assets themselves can be dynamically assembled for every listener and designed to fit the medium\u2019s auditory style.\n\nProgrammatic advertising is bound to have a powerful and notable impact on the marketing mix for brands and businesses of all sizes.

A year later, we had built our new business to $1.2 million in online sales and sold more than 50,000 copies of my book. We were on track to do $1.7 million in sales this year when the pandemic hit. Our sales dropped by $140,000 within 30 days. The Facebook ad campaigns we\u2019d been running stopped working. As a result, we had to reduce our Facebook advertising budget from $88,000 per month to less than $30,000 per month because they largely became unprofitable.\n\nLike everyone else, I was in shock. All the effort my team put in was in jeopardy. Worse yet, the free online support we\u2019d provided in the area of mental health was at risk of shutting down.\n\nWhether you have an online business or not, this article is going to provide options to help you get back on your feet that you may not have considered, including:\n\nFighting the Lies Fear Creates\n\nIdentifying the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nGetting Sales Guilt By Creating Goodwill, Readying to Rebound\n\nSecuring a Flat-Fee Capital Loan\n\nReducing Expenses and Securing a \u201cCash Back\u201d Credit Card\n\nIdentifying Low-Cost Opportunities With a Big Upside\n\nOnline Optimization on Steroids\n\nSales Funnel Optimization \u2014 Why a 1-Second Delay Could Cost You $2.5 Million Each Year\n\nTime to Test!\n\n1. Fighting the Lies Fear Creates\n\nWhen sales dropped, my heart sank, and I began panicking. Trauma can rewire the brain to focus on negative experiences, making it hard to create logical plans. The first thing I did was to make a list of all the worst-case scenarios I\u2019d worked through in the past, like surviving Hurricane Sandy, losing my father to brain cancer and other dire situations.\n\nWhy? Reminding myself that I overcame insurmountable odds to get back into my logical, rational mind helped me recenter. I also stayed away from social media\u2019s fear-based echo-chamber of panic to keep my brain from actively seeking out the threats, which clouds the mind.\n\nTo regain emotional control, I designed a visualization that uses a combination of neurolinguistic programming (NLP) and hypnosis. One of our members used it to confront the person who had sexually assaulted her years ago, and it freed her emotionally after 20 years. It can be applied to any dilemma many of us find ourselves in. This style of visualization is a gym workout for your brain. It takes practice to master your mind, and this moment calls for it.\n\nAfter a week of doing this, I was able to regulate my emotions to implement the following business and marketing strategies. These are technical so that you will be forced outside your comfort zone.\n\n2. Identifying the Worst-Case Scenario\n\nWe went through our finances, looked at our running expenses and calculated how long we could sustain. Unsure of how long this chaos would last, we projected our scenarios based on six months of running at or just above breakeven. Once we did that, we worked backward to prevent it from occurring.\n\n3. Getting Over Sales Guilt By Creating Goodwill, Readying Rebound\n\nA conversation popping up online was from business owners feeling guilty about whether to sell goods or not as job losses increased. Working in the biohacking/mental health space, we have always been conscious of this. We made it a rule in the early days not to sell to those who are in a vulnerable position, instead directing them to free online resources we offer so that, if they find themselves in a financial situation, we\u2019ll still be there to support them.\n\nNot every business can provide free resources. Still, you can create goodwill by donating a percentage of sales to charities that support the vulnerable, or offer discounts to nurses and frontline workers who are fighting the pandemic. You can also use your email list or social media platforms to drive attention to someone else\u2019s efforts. You don\u2019t need money to make a difference; you need creativity.\n\nTo play our part in supporting those hard-hit, we also created a comprehensive and free 23-page \u201cEmergency Action Plan\u201d vulnerable individuals could download to help them come up with their plan, generating more 700 downloads within the first few days of release.\n\nOnce we had our goodwill plan in place, we dived into the demographics of our customers and started targeting people via Facebook ads that had a certain level of income. You can\u2019t go broke trying to help others; otherwise, the assistance you provide will be short-lived.\n\n4. Securing a Flat-Fee Capital Loan\n\nAs a precautionary measure, I took out a capital loan via online-payment processor Stripe, which all of our transactions run through. Similar to PayPal, it can provide capital loans within a few short minutes based on your previous sales volume. These loans have a flat fee and are paid back at a smaller percentage rate based on your daily sales volume. Making them manageable and avoiding expensive interest rates. Companies such as Quickbooks can also provide capital loans based on your accounting history, albeit at a more significant percentage rate.\n\n5. Reducing Expenses and Securing a \u201cCash Back\u201d Credit Card\n\nMy priority was to keep my staff on but double-down our focus on income opportunities. We scoured our expenses, canceling monthly subscriptions to online software and non-essential expenses we weren\u2019t utilizing. These fees can add up to hundreds, if not thousands of dollars per month. We used the app Truebill for business and personal accounts to ensure we didn\u2019t miss anything.\n\nI also found a Chase cash-back credit card that provides monthly rewards based on our advertising spend, such as Facebook ads. The one I chose also came with a $500 cash-back reward if we spent a certain amount within the first three months.\n\n6. Identifying Low-Cost Opportunities With a Big Upside\n\nWe went through all of our assets, i.e. database, previous customers, customers due to re-order certain products, social media channels such as YouTube that generate sales at low cost. Then, we identified which ones presented us with the greatest opportunity to generate profits. We also came up with ideas to partner with others on that would not only extend our reach, but minimize our risk at the same time.\n\nA local caf\u00e9, Book + Bottle, launched their new store the same week everything began closing. I provided a few suggestions for Terra, the owner. Mostly dependent on walk-in traffic, I introduced her to the marketing manager of our high-rise building to offer a prize pack of books and wine to a resident with the best-decorated interior. The building could then leverage those images in their marketing collateral, while Terra was introduced to an entire building of residents to grow her network.\n\nShe also posted to social media a competition that allowed people to \u201ctag their favorite nurse\u201d for a chance to win a gift pack. Hence, creating virality and goodwill.\n\nIf you are a retail store or restaurant, do not look past apartment complexes you can team up within your local area. These complexes will be fighting hard to keep their existing residences happy while fighting against new developments that may take leaseholders away from them.\n\n7. Online Optimization on Steroids\n\nAlthough retail closed, the conversation with our customers didn\u2019t stop. It just transitioned online. Even though we are already an online business, we quadrupled our efforts and small tweaks to double our profits with the same amount of ad spend. Here\u2019s what we did:\n\nSpeed-test our website page. According to data shared by Small SEO Tools and Strangeloop, a one-second delay in page load time will drop your conversion rate by 7 percent. This means that if your website drives $100,000 per day in sales, you could lose $2.5 million per year in lost conversions. We used Solarwinds Pingdom to test key pages for free to identify why your page is loading slowly. We then chose to recreate landing pages in Unbounce. Unbounce is a landing-page builder and optimizes your images and page content to increase load time. Our page went from a load time of 8.5 seconds to 2.5 seconds. We also uncovered 80-plus percent of our sales for the month of January were a result of mobile adverts running on Facebook. Hence, an opportunity to optimize specifically for mobile too. Doing a little research, we came across Accelerated Mobile Pages (AMP). It\u2019s a simplified page HTML page that is backed by Google. Many media outlets use it when they post their articles to Facebook. You can learn about it here.\n\n8. Sales Funnel Optimization\n\nIt doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re a retail store or a restaurant, we all need a sales funnel that gets people to opt in to our email lists, so we can continue to communicate with them without any additional expenses. Email still has one of the highest returns on investment available to us. Here are a few examples of what you can do;\n\nRestaurant/Caf\u00e9s: Email your regulars once a week with a list of specials you have on offer. Create a Q&A section at the bottom of each email that can easily be duplicated each time that health and safety concerns are addressed. Your customers need to know you\u2019re taking steps to protect them. Keep up the regular weekly communication, and keep your customers informed if your hours change.\n\nRetail: If you can segment customers based on previous buying behavior, send email campaigns that speak to their needs. And never, ever, promote more than three products per email. Several years ago, I worked with a fashion designer. We reduced the number of items she promoted in each email from 15 to three, taking her online sales from $10,000 per month to in excess of $100,000 per month.\n\nOnline Businesses: Take the time to assess any email funnels you have and identify email campaigns that don\u2019t convert. Can you create a more compelling offer that\u2019s relevant to their changing needs? And, most importantly, test your email subject lines. It can make or break your sales funnel.\n\nOnline Content: We went through all the content we posted in the past year, including articles, videos and social media posts to identify pieces that drove sales. Go through your content and compare it to your sales reports to see if a spike in sales coincided with a particular social media piece or article sent to your email list. Now you can reuse or repurpose it by putting it into context with what\u2019s currently occurring.\n\nIt\u2019s vital that you optimize your email funnel as soon as possible. Look at open and click-through rates and conversion rates for each email you send. If you\u2019re not tracking this data, speak to your website developer and set it up now.\n\n9. Time to Test\n\nOnce we had implemented all the changes above, which took a month, we reached full testing mode, which included assessing all of our previously winning Facebook ads and driving our email list to the newly optimized landing pages, with freshly optimized email campaigns. While we still have a long way to go, and despite our revenue taking a massive hit, the worst-case scenario has yet to transpire. Sales are once again gradually on the increase, and we may still hit our yearly target.\n\nBuild The Plane as You Fly It!\n\nWe\u2019re all faced with a million things that need to be done urgently. In this rush, we fail to identify the small tweaks that can quickly double our profits with little effort. Set aside the same time every single day to focus on the elements above, instead of saying, \u201cI\u2019ll get to it when I have time.\u201d For the past year, I have blocked out the first half of each day to focus on sales and marketing; everything else comes after this. Set a time that works for your schedule and stick to it as if your business depends on it because, for many of us, it does.\n\nFinally, if you don\u2019t look after your mental health right now, you won\u2019t have the mental faculty to get done what you need to. Often the solutions will pop up in a moment of silence, but first, you need to give your brain space to what it does best.\n\nRelated: Should You Microdose to Treat Depression?\n\nAre you ready to become unstoppable?\n\nVisit www.areyouunstoppable.com and take your FREE 60-second online quiz now.

Me too.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, those books are good, and some are even classics, but content marketing is always evolving. You must keep up with what\u2019s new and exciting in the field so you can apply it to your business, no matter how big or small you are.\n\nSo, I decided to take a deep dive into the newer content marketing books that have been released in the last couple of years. I\u2019ve gathered the best 17 books on content marketing that\u2019ll help you be a better marketer, strategies, and business owner.\n\n1. Content Marketing by Gavin Turner\n\nTurner\u2019s book is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your business with proven strategies that\u2019ll help grow your brand and business. It\u2019s filled with useful tactics you can use in both the short-and long-term to ramp up your marketing, boost content recognition and production and how to tie it all together.\n\n2. Dreyer\u2019s English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style by Benjamin Dreyer\n\nA fresh alternative to the dull grammar and writing books out there, Dreyer\u2019s English was written by a long-time copy chief at Random House Publishing. It\u2019s an engaging and fun look at words and grammar that anyone will appreciate, no matter if you\u2019re new or a veteran marketer. Use it to answer your questions about when to use a semicolon or em dash and why it\u2019s okay to start a sentence with \u201cAnd\u201d or \u201cBut.\u201d\n\n3. F#ck Content Marketing: Focus on Content Experience to Drive Demand, Revenue & Relationships by Randy Frisch\n\nOnce you get past the title, this book is an excellent resource for content marketers. Frisch, the CMO and co-founder of Uberflip, wrote it to help marketers focus more on the way content is experienced, rather than simply pumping it out. His main idea is that marketers have worried too much about content production and not enough about content scalability. It\u2019s an interesting read and one that can help marketers surface their content in the never-ending chronological scroll that is our online world today.\n\n4. Marketing Rebellion: The Most Human Company Wins by Mark Schaefer\n\nSchaefer wrote this book because he knows that the marketing landscape has changed dramatically. Consumers have so many ways of avoiding ads on TV, their browsers, and social media streams that marketers have no choice but to change their tactics. In the book, Schaefer advocates that marketers take a more effective and human approach to their messages. He explains it all clearly and outlines actionable steps that all marketers can take to move forward.\n\n5. Mean People Suck: How Empathy Leads to Bigger Profits and a Better Life by Michael Brenner\n\nThis book was published at a time when interest in the customer experience is more critical than ever, and job dissatisfaction is at an all-time high. Negativity can seep into any business from anywhere, so Brenner explains the benefits of empathy at work, and how it can help people be better outside the office too. Brenner\u2019s filled the book with stories of companies that were able to replace toxic cultures and dissatisfied customers with helpful, positive employees that delivered high-quality customer experiences.\n\n6. Superfans: The Easy Way to Stand Out, Grow Your Tribe, and Build a Successful Business by Pat Flynn\n\nFlynn wrote this book to help entrepreneurs build a more engaged, loyal audience, and explains why a smaller, more loyal audience is better. Superfans makes the case that we should be thinking more about connecting with our audiences on a deeper level through extra-special moments that \u201ccreate novelty, defy expectations, and break the mold.\u201d\n\n7. Talk Triggers by Jay Baer and Daniel Lemin\n\nBaer and Lemin do an excellent job of writing about an often overlooked aspect of content marketing in this book \u2014 word of mouth marketing. Most marketers don\u2019t have a strategy for this particular marketing channel, so they created one. Their \u201c4-5-6\u201d learning system will help you uncover and activate talk triggers in your business. They\u2019re such good writers that this well-organized book explains a complex topic without being overwhelming.\n\n8. They Ask, You Answer by Marcus Sheridan\n\nSheridan\u2019s popular book got an update last year, with new sections on closing deals with video marketing and the essential elements every good business website should have. He also included new stories of businesses who\u2019ve used these tactics to great success, lending even more proof to the fact that this strategy works for everyone.\n\n9. Conversational Marketing by Dave Gerhardt and David Cancel\n\nDrift co-founders Cancel and Gerhardt wrote this book as the definitive book on how to generate better leads and close more sales with chatbots. Conversational Marketing explains how chatbots are transforming the way brands market themselves and interact with customers. It\u2019s a well-written and digestible primer on how to convert a business from traditional communication channels to the modern messaging apps we all use today.\n\n10. Killing Marketing: How Innovative Businesses Are Turning Marketing Cost Into Profit by Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose\n\nIn this follow-up book to an earlier classic, Pulizzi and Rose explain how today\u2019s innovative companies are achieving remarkable results by fundamentally changing their approach. They\u2019ve dramatically increased customer loyalty and revenue by creating more value for customers by using owned media and changing to a customer-centric way of thinking about content. Pulizzi and Rose write in an engaging, easy-to-read manner that makes it enjoyable to learn more about this new take on content marketing.\n\n11. Crisis Ready: Building an Invincible Brand in an Uncertain World by Melissa Agnes\n\nInformation moves fast today, and many marketers aren\u2019t ready for when things go wrong. Since marketers are often involved in PR and crisis management for today\u2019s modern brands, it makes sense that they learn a bit more about how to handle bad situations. Agnes focuses more on being proactive rather than reactive in her book, helping brands anticipate threats so they can handle them with resiliency and poise.\n\n12. The Lead Machine: The Small Business Guide to Digital Marketing by Rich Brooks\n\nWhile not about content marketing specifically, this book can help entrepreneurs and small business owners develop strategies to manage the digital marketing channels they\u2019ll use to distribute their marketing. It walks you through the steps to create a social media strategy, explains how to increase SEO, add subscribers to your email list and convert loyal fans into customers.\n\n13. This Is Marketing: You Can\u2019t Be Seen Until You Learn to See by Seth Godin\n\nSeth Godin has written several wonderful books on marketing, and his latest is another great entry. In it, he breaks down how to tap into conversations with your audience and engage them with marketing that matters to them. He teaches you how to craft content that speaks directly to your audience, builds trust with them, builds a product or brand they\u2019ll care about, and how to use storytelling as a powerful marketing strategy. Another great read from Godin.\n\n14. Marketing Made Simple: A Step-by-Step StoryBrand Guide for Any Business by Donald Miller\n\nIn keeping with the storytelling theme, next is Donald Miller\u2019s latest book about using his StoryBrand framework for any business. Here, he offers a five-part checklist to help marketers and business owners apply his StoryBrand messaging framework to key customer touchpoints to develop, strengthen, and communicate their brand\u2019s story. Companies that use his methods see double-digit increases in engagement and sales numbers, so if you\u2019re interested in the nuts-and-bolts of it all, this book\u2019s for you.\n\n15. Traffic Secrets: The Underground Playbook for Filling Your Websites and Funnels with Your Dream Customers by Russell Brunson\n\nAs more people jump into entrepreneurship, they must learn how to generate traffic and fill their sales funnels; otherwise, no one will hear about your amazing products that could make a difference in their lives. Traffic Secrets will help you discover and understand precisely who your dream customers are, find where they are online and create the hooks that\u2019ll grab their attention and bring them to your business.\n\n16. SEO 2020 by Adam Clarke\n\nSEO is always a moving target as the search engines change their algorithms. In this updated version of the book, Clarke explains how to do SEO today, dives into the details of what Google\u2019s changed in their algorithms and explains how to use them to your advantage.\n\n17. Top of Mind by John Hall\n\nStaying top-of-mind is the ultimate goal for a brand. You want to be the one consumers remember when they\u2019re ready to buy. In this book, Hall reveals how consumer expectations have changed and what that means to brand owners and how to build a helpful, authentic brand that serves others more than it serves you.

But creating a second act for your business journey will help you prepare for the inevitable, while creating a stream of income your business desperately needs.\n\nEntrepreneurs must fulfill the needs and emotions of their audience in different ways than before.

Analyzing the current mental state of the client will help you customize your offer to something that will sell and help fulfill the need for what your client wants.\n\nOffering something such as one-on-one strategy calls and new ways for clients to tackle the current situations with their will provide more clarity to the entrepreneur as an individual. This clarity can then help them build a more reliable brand.\n\n2. Increase content and create more on digital media platforms\n\nSocial media usage has shown a massive spike in numbers when it comes to users utilizing newer and current platforms during this pandemic. The creation of content on platforms is critical for Entrepreneurs because it gives them the opportunity to showcase thought leadership.\n\nIn addition to the content on social media, creating content utilizing digital media platforms such as podcasts, YouTube videos, and even Tik Tok can communicate necessary value to new and current consumers. The latest platform, Tik Tok, has over 500 million users worldwide, and creating visually appealing content can help create a funnel for entrepreneurs to gain new customers. Using these platforms as a marketing tool while providing value and staying authentic will attract more eyes to the brand.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy\n\n3. Create online digital experiences that replicate in-person emotions\n\nWhile most, if not all, business events have been canceled, the first step of is rescheduling events and keeping the in-person event ideas alive for when it is safe to have them. However, in the meantime, creating the digital event, roundtable, or conference as if everyone was actually in-person can assist in driving conversations of business development and defining the next steps in an entrepreneur's journey. Platforms like hopin.to and bluejeans.com create great in-person vibes for events, conferences, and intimate workshops as well that work towards creating an engaging experience.\n\n4. Build new relationships that can foster new monetary partnerships\n\nA brand or business's relevance through awareness during this time of crisis is significant because maintaining a relationship with your consumers will drive genuine conversations that can turn into partnerships and potentially sponsorships that give more value to your audience.\n\nDirect messages, one-on-one zoom calls, and think tanks are great ways to start conversations. Simply saying \"how can I help you?\" can lead to a new business partnership.\n\nUltimately business is an odyssey, so when the current crisis is over, having an exit strategy that moves you forward is essential. Even if it's just going back to the same business model as before.\n\nLikewise, strengthening new and existing relationships is vital, because on the other side of this, consumers and partners are going to remember who was there for them.\n\nRelated: How to Become a Brand, Not an Employee", "author": ["Andrew Nguyen"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/H9Btak43CC8/350643", "published": "2020-05-14T19:15:00", "title": "Free Webinar | May 27: How to Increase Sales and Find New Customers While Working From Home", "text": "May 14, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way we do forever.

From DIY home improvement to street fashion, there\u2019s a blog for every topic you could ever dream of. If you\u2019ve got an idea, there are people out there willing to read about it! As the world adjusts to the new normal of social distancing and WFH, many will turn to bloggers as a source of entertainment and inspiration. So this begs the question: how does your businesses\u2019 blog stand out? Unfortunately, the answer is not simply to publish good articles \u2013 that\u2019s true, but not enough. We live in the age of information overload; for every question, there\u2019s bound to be five people with an answer. Crafting blog posts that will gather the attention of viewers and draw more traffic is going to require a bit more work. But don\u2019t be afraid! It won\u2019t involve staring for hours at your laptop screen in your pajamas (or your WFH quarantine outfit of the day). To enhance your blogs, it\u2019s going to require some added thought beyond posting, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to adopt the life of a full-time influencer. As you implement techniques to enhance traffic, you\u2019ll find they do a lot of the work for you \u2013 meaning less time on your part. I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favorite pro tips and ideas from other experienced bloggers to help you propel your blog above the rest. Grab your cup of Dalgona coffee, sit back, and let\u2019s talk blogs!\n\n1. Re-evaluate your niche\n\nRemember when I said there\u2019s an audience for every topic? It\u2019s still true, but the popularity of (or lack of) your topic can actually hurt your blog traffic. To explain, let\u2019s quickly visit your childhood and the story of Goldilocks and the three bears; the porridge was either too hot, too cold, or just right. Just like the porridge, your topic has to be just right in terms of the size of its audience. Choose a topic too large and you may have a difficult time standing out. If you choose one too specific, you could have a difficult time attracting a following. So here\u2019s my advice: if your audience isn\u2019t as large or reachable as you\u2019d like, reconsider your blog\u2019s focus, and adjust it\u2019s specificity accordingly.\n\nRelated: Get One-on-One Expert Help From Entrepreneur NEXT powered by Assemble\n\n2. Adjust posting frequency\n\nMuch like posting on social media, determining your post frequency for your blog is just as crucial. Post too much and your viewers may feel overwhelmed; post too little and they may forget about your blog altogether. There is no universally correct amount of posts that will drive your traffic up \u2013 as fantastic as that would be. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to suddenly churn out five blogs a week! Start slowly, adding an extra post, or even experimenting with one less post. Watch closely how your traffic reacts, and you\u2019ll slowly determine the frequency that will bring in a steady stream of viewers!\n\n3. Feature your most popular posts\n\nMost blog platforms will have a feature that allows users to showcase their most popular posts on the main page; my advice is to use this to your advantage. By showing off some of your most successful posts, this will impress any viewer first arriving at your page, and increase the likelihood that they\u2019ll visit your other posts, as well. Take some time to look through your past blogs and notice which ones received the most engagement and views. By showing off these specific posts, visitors to your blog site will be more likely to return to see similar content!\n\nRelated: How to Start a Blog and Make Money Online\n\n4. Post about your blog\n\nSometimes less is more, but not in this case. Promoting your blog shouldn\u2019t stop once it\u2019s published. Now is the time to tap into your influencer side, and post, post, post! I\u2019ve worked with blog sites at a variety of companies, and if I\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s that promoting blogs on social media is a surefire way to increase traffic. Provide clickable links to your latest blogs on Facebook and Twitter, and post the website link to your blog in your Instagram bio. Increasing the visibility of your blogs across social media will surely benefit your blog traffic, and demonstrate to your followers that you have more to offer outside of these platforms.\n\n5. Add keywords\n\nHave you heard of SEO? If not, let\u2019s take a quick crash course. SEO means \u201cSearch Engine Optimization\u201d, or optimizing your content so that it ranks higher in search results. One of the easiest ways to dip your toes into SEO is by adding keywords to your content that are currently popular in your niche. For example, if I wanted to write a blog about pop culture, I\u2019d sprinkle in keywords such as \u201cGigi Hadid\u201d, \u201cCharli D\u2019Amelio\u201d, or \u201cTiger King\u201d (all currently trending topics in the celebrity realm). Adding keywords will increase your blog\u2019s chances of becoming more visible in searches on the web, therefore bringing more traffic to your site!\n\nRelated: How to Write a Book (and Actually Finish It) in 5 Steps\n\n6. Follow related blogs for inspiration\n\nThe good news is, you\u2019re not alone. Where there\u2019s one blog about an industry, there\u2019s bound to be plenty more, and that\u2019s not always a bad thing! In fact, there\u2019s no better inspiration than existing content from other businesses and leaders related to your topic. If you\u2019re feeling stuck, or even need somewhere to simply begin your blog, look to others for inspiration. Connect with them. Learn how they became successful with blogging and mold their success tips into creating your own popular blog site. And stay connected! I can guarantee, after years of experience in blogs, there are still moments of feeling stuck despite having a good amount of experience under my belt. When these times come, I turn to the blogs of other established people within the industry. Soon enough, the creative juices flow once again, and they will for you, too.\n\n7. Guest blog posts\n\nHere\u2019s a tip that will give your tired fingers a rest from typing: invite someone else to write a blog on your site. I don\u2019t mean someone random that you meet on the street (but who am I to judge your strategy?), rather someone who is within your industry. In #6, I spoke about how there are many blogs for almost every topic- which means there is also a good bunch of people who are like-minded to you. Tap into this network. Although partnering with your competition can be an intimidating idea, there\u2019s no need to be afraid. Guest blogging can be a friendly way to help one another gain new blog traffic, and introduce your brand\u2019s content to an entirely new audience. By hosting another industry professional\u2019s content on your site, you\u2019ll be able to offer a fresh perspective for your readers \u2013 and keep them coming back for more.\n\nCreating and maintaining a successful blog is no easy feat, and certainly isn\u2019t accomplished overnight. But don\u2019t let those initial feelings overwhelm you; it does get easier over time with a little practice and fine-tuning. Take the time to determine the best plan for your blog, and stick to it as much as possible. The more you put into promoting your blog posts and standing out amongst the sea of competitors, the more views you\u2019ll receive!", "author": ["Entrepreneur Next"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/9wLAEwCksVk/349181", "published": "2020-05-13T21:00:00", "title": "Want to Advertise Your Business on Podcasts? Here's How to Get Started.", "text": "May 13, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nEveryone \u201cknows\u201d that sponsoring podcasts is, quite often, one of the most effective and easiest ways to launch a modern startup and set it on a fast-growth trajectory. Although podcast audience numbers are down slightly during the pandemic, most industry observers predict they will bounce back up once the stay-at-home orders are rescinded and commutes resume.\n\nPodcasting is especially attractive for advertisers, since it enables distribution of content when the audiences want it, wherever they want it and in whatever platform they choose to consume it.\n\nWhen plans are laid to launch a modern campaign, spending money on podcasts is almost certainly going to be strongly considered. According to Triton Digital, a provider of technology for the podcast industry, there are more than 800,000 active podcasts available, with 54 million episodes.\n\nTaking those first few steps in this process can be simple: First, determine the audience profile that makes up your target market. Basic information to include their age range, gender, education, occupation, income level, family situation, geographic location, politics, hobbies and interests, etc. Then, identify the podcast distribution networks that represent which shows reach your target market, and work with those companies' sales personnel to help figure out which specific shows reach the best audience profile within the desired spend or budget.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons to Add a Podcast to Your Content-Marketing Strategy\n\nVerifying the legitimacy of a podcast is crucial. Have they worked with other well-known advertisers? Do they have known/legit guests, hosts, and/or a legit media brand associated with them?\n\nAccording to Lex Friedman, CRO of Art19, a California-based independently owned podcast company, there are three common mistakes entrepreneurs make with podcast campaigns:\n\nThe first is trying to make a podcast ad sound like a radio ad. \u201cRadio listeners instinctively hit the preset station button to avoid listening to ads. In fact, one of the reasons audiences continue to abandon radio for podcasts is to avoid the endless personal injury lawyer pitches and car dealership owners yelling at them,\u201d says Friedman.\n\nThe second is sponsoring a podcast mainly based on the fact that the decision-maker likes the show, without spending the time and effort to determine whether the show\u2019s audience profile is right for the brand and product. \u201cThe audience profile and your target market may overlap, but not closely enough, or you may just want to support some of your favorite podcasts,\u201d says Friedman.\n\nThe last mistake is being too cautious with your budget. Despite its widespread growth, podcasting remains one of the best options for entrepreneurs with shoe-string budget DIY campaigns, but Friedman says, \u201cDon\u2019t try to \u2018dip a toe\u2019 in podcast advertising and expect to get any results ... or even learn anything useful. If you only have a minimal amount \u2014 a few thousand dollars to invest \u2014 better to wait until you\u2019re able to properly fund a campaign.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey of 168,500 podcast listeners, the podcast advertising network Midroll found that \u201ccampaigns with ads on five or more episodes result in 39 percent more listener recall than those with just one spot. Running spots on just four episodes improves unaided brand recall by 27 percent compared to running a single ad.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Promote Your New Podcast: 10 Effective Strategies to Try\n\nSpeaking of spend, podcast ad deals \u201care not that complicated,\u201d says Richard Laermer, CEO of RLM PR. \u201cThere are two fundamental numbers always to consider: the first is the audience number, which gets measured as downloads, the higher the podcast's audience, the more an advertiser pays) The second number is CPM.\u201d CPM stands for cost per 1,000, M being the Roman numeral for 1,000. For podcasts, the 1,000 refers to downloads. When a podcast and an advertiser broker an ad deal, CPM is the number they negotiate. According to Laermer, \u201cgenerally, CPMs range from $25 to $40, and sometimes higher if the podcast is really hot or hits a niche audience.\u201d\n\nAccording to Midroll, 63% of podcast listeners have bought a product they heard advertised on a podcast. Whether the topic is daily news or sports, true-crime, career-booster professional development or obscure historical events, podcasts have become a part of our daily routines, making commutes easier and life more interesting, and represent a prime opportunity to change the way consumers respond to advertising in general.", "author": ["Dave Hochman"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/z7DBnH6vfPU/349942", "published": "2020-05-11T18:00:00", "title": "4 Questions You Should Ask Before Investing in Influencer Marketing", "text": "May 11, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nInfluencer marketing is alive and well. It\u2019s thriving, in fact. According to Mediakix, \"89 percent of marketers have reported that ROI from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels\" they invest in.\n\nStill, I\u2019ll admit, when influencer marketing first became a thing, I wasn\u2019t sure if the trend would last as long as it has. But I\u2019ve been happily proven wrong again and again, as it continues to be a worthwhile channel to invest in for brands of all sizes.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t learned whether influencer marketing can help you connect with new customers, drive sales and grow your business, now is the perfect time to find out. There are now more resources, tools and case studies available than ever before that can teach you everything you need to know to build a successful campaign.\n\nAfter spending part of the year talking with and learning from successful marketers about how to get the most out of working with influencers, I\u2019ve come to believe that there are four main questions every marketer should ask before getting too far along in the process. Those questions are as follows....\n\nRelated: Influencer Marketing Really Is a Game-Changer\n\n1. How well do I really know my customers?\n\nBefore investing in any new marketing channel, it\u2019s important that you take a step back and think about who your customers are and what matters to them. Knowing your customers and their motivations will help you throughout the development of your campaign \u2014 everything from deciding which platform to focus on and which influencer to hire to what kind of content to create and promote.\n\nThere are a lot of different exercises you can go through to put yourself in the shoes of your customers, but one of my favorites is known as empathy mapping. The purpose of an empathy map is to try to better understand what your customers think, how they feel, what they say and what actions they take. It\u2019s similar to a customer persona, but the creation process is often quicker and more collaborative. When you build an empathy map, you can choose who you want to gain insights from. It could be your marketing employees, some of your best and most loyal customers, other employees across other departments at your company or a blended group comprised of all three groups.\n\nBy the end of the process, you should have a better understanding of who your customers are, what their goals are and what they are motivated by.\n\nTo plan your first empathy map exercise, use this helpful step-by-step toolkit from IBM.\n\n2. What message am I trying to send?\n\nYou can hire the most popular influencer in the world, but your efforts are going to be fruitless unless you have a firm grasp on the specific message you\u2019re ultimately trying to send to your audience. Remember: You\u2019re not hiring influencers to sell for you \u2014 at least not directly. Instead, you\u2019re partnering with them to help you build relationships and establish trust with people. To do that, you need to have a clear idea of the message you\u2019re trying to get through to people.\n\nFor example, when Sprint launched a marketing campaign that leveraged influencers, they didn\u2019t make the message all about phones and phone service. Why? Because it\u2019s a message that ultimately won\u2019t resonate with people. Instead of focusing on themselves, Sprint worked with influencers to create a viral video that helped promote their #LiveUnlimited hashtag, which encourages people to follow their dreams and work hard for what they want.\n\nThink about what message you want to send to your customers. What matters to your customers, and what beliefs or motivations could you tap into with the help of the right influencers?\n\n3. What kind of person do I want to partner with?\n\nOne of the hardest truths to understand when you\u2019re new to influencer marketing is that not all influencers are created equal. This was one of the most common pieces of advice I got when talking with more than a dozen experienced marketers who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring influencers to help promote products and brands. Everyone said the same thing: You have to really know who you\u2019re working with and how they can help you.\n\nThings aren\u2019t always what they seem. Influencers can buy fake followers and make themselves appear bigger and more popular than they really are. Some social sites are working to crack down on the problem, but it hasn\u2019t been completely solved yet. You can waste a lot of money hiring people that won\u2019t actually be able to bring any sort of value or ROI back to your business.\n\nThe best way to avoid this is to think of influencers as business partners, not simply people you pay to promote products. A partner will ask questions, seek to understand your customers and your goals and help you develop a campaign that hits the mark. If you reach out to an influencer and all they care about is getting paid, it\u2019s probably worth finding someone else to work with.\n\n4. What will success look like for me?\n\nInfluencer marketing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It\u2019s not the golden goose that will lead to an instantaneous influx in sales as soon as you hit go on your campaign. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to think about how else you can track success along the way. You should know before launching a campaign how you\u2019ll measure success. If it\u2019s not immediate and direct sales, what does success look like for you? Maybe it\u2019s related to increases in engagement or website traffic. Maybe it\u2019s a boost in followers. Maybe all you want is to align yourself with a well-known person in your industry that you know your prospective customers like and trust.\n\nRelated: 4 Influencer-Marketing Secrets Entrepreneurs Need to Know\n\nThinking about the bigger picture and all the ways you can measure success will prevent you from getting too discouraged or giving up before you find out what kind of impact influencer marketing can have on your business.", "author": ["William Harris"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/mYaKRAWBCUI/349535", "published": "2020-05-10T20:30:00", "title": "Best Practices for Marketing During and After COVID-19", "text": "May 10, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nA global crisis can either paralyze a marketing team or galvanize it to thrive. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing: some companies are cutting back on marketing (in some instances, laying off the entire marketing team), while others are being more agile and coming up with interesting ways of engaging their audience during these difficult times.\n\nIf you want to stay in business, you can\u2019t stay idle for long. As a business owner myself, I understand why many entrepreneurs would want to cut down completely on marketing activities. Being conservative feels like the safe choice when there\u2019s uncertainly about how long the crisis will last. But we have to balance financial responsibility with the need to keep consumers informed and engaged when things get tough.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy\n\nIn fact, long-term studies show that the right approach during economic uncertainty is to increase \u2014 not decrease \u2014 your marketing spend. The last thing you want is to be caught flat-footed and find yourself lagging your competitors when the economy revs up again.\n\nFor the most part, consumers are receptive to some marketing at this time. A recent study from the American Association of Advertising Agencies found that 43% of consumers find it reassuring to hear from brands. In addition, 56% said they like learning how brands are helping their communities during the pandemic. Only 15% said they\u2019d rather not hear from companies.\n\nThat said, marketing during these times requires sensitivity to what\u2019s going on in people\u2019s lives and the flexibility to keep up with swift and swooping changes.\n\nStart with customer empathy\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on consumer behaviors and attitudes cannot be understated. An ongoing study we\u2019re conducting with our sister company Reach3 Insights recently found that 76% have recently picked up new habits, behaviors and routines in the wake of COVID-19. Of those people, 89% said they plan on keeping some of their new habits. Consumers are also trying new products, with 36% planning to continue using new brands they\u2019ve tried after COVID-19.\n\nNow is not the time to rely on assumptions. Any data you have from 6 weeks ago\u2014let alone 6 months ago\u2014is already out of date. As the consulting firm Gartner recently advised, CMOs must be proactive in monitoring changes to customer behaviors and purchasing needs while the crisis is unfolding.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips for Marketing a Service Business\n\nBusinesses must move forward but do so with genuine empathy. Marketers can help C-suite executives take the right action by acting as a lighthouse for consumer understanding. Many companies already have existing Voice of Customer and research programs\u2014these can be leveraged at this time to uncover the emotions underlying people\u2019s shifting attitudes and behaviors. Doubling down on customer engagement and listening programs can help provide insights on how to best move forward.\n\nTell relevant, authentic stories \u2014 and give, give, give\n\nImpressively, some brands have already produced compelling campaigns that speak to the realities of the pandemic. Dove, for example, created a spot shining a light on the courage of health care workers. Some brands, like Budweiser and Burger King, are focusing on social distancing and encouraging people to do their part by staying home. One of my favorites is Sam\u2019s Club, which recently created a 60-second spot thanking its employees and calling them \u201cretail heroes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great to see creativity in storytelling at this time, but marketers must push their companies to do even more. This is the time to pay it forward and provide as much value as possible to your customers and communities.\n\nEvery organization and person has the capacity to contribute in their own way. The most important question companies should ask themselves is this: \u201cwhat can I do to help?\u201d\n\nGiving back can take several forms. For instance, J\u00e4germeister is hosting a virtual event to help raise funds for New York restaurant owners. In tech, companies like Apple quickly mobilized their resources to produce much-needed PPEs. In my home country of Canada, big-box retailers such as Loblaw and Save-on-Foods have increased the wages of their front-line staff to show appreciation for their efforts. Following the lead of many software companies, Nike has temporarily eliminated its subscription fees for its app to help people stay fit while quarantining.\n\nThese moves transcend marketing and may not increase sales immediately, but they\u2019ll build goodwill and help drive long-term loyalty. Giving back is simply the right thing to do. The faster the world can beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the better chance all companies have in surviving the crisis.\n\nBe agile for the new normal\n\nSome entrepreneurs and marketers are holding off action, thinking that things will be back to \u201cnormal\u201d in a few weeks or months. I do not hold the same view.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Solopreneurs Can Strengthen Their Businesses Through Marketing\n\nFor one, some scientists are predicting that some form of social distancing may need to happen until 2022. That\u2019s a long time to put any type of marketing on hold. A more important consideration is the fact that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on the psyche and outlook of consumers. In our own COVID-19 study, 86% of Americans and 81% of Canadians agreed that the crisis will create a new normal and have a lasting impact on society.\n\nRegardless of how long the crisis actually lasts, COVID-19 will forever change the consumer landscape. After this comes to pass, companies can\u2019t go back to their old playbooks. Personas, messaging and even your product strategy may need to significantly evolve for the realities of the post-COVID-19 world.\n\nFor various reasons, some CMOs are hesitant to engage consumers in research at this time. But as Gartner\u2019s Frances Russell points out in a recent article, many marketers who have deployed surveys specifically about COVID-19's impact on customer experience have seen actionable responses. We see this in our own research as well: Not only are people answering our conversational chat surveys, they are also providing detailed selfie videos, which is really helping us and our clients and partners understand the human impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe bottom line is that fresh data and accurate insights have never been more important. In these uncharted territories, relying on instincts alone is dangerous. If you haven\u2019t reached out to your customers in the past month, now\u2019s the time to do so.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to recognize the uncertainties and fears surrounding COVID-19, don\u2019t let this crisis paralyze you. Enabling your team to really understand your customers and act based on timely insights is key to navigating your way through this crisis both for your marketing team and your company.", "author": ["Andrew Reid"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/bt2wXjB2Y7Y/349386", "published": "2020-05-08T15:50:00", "title": "How to Build an Online Community of Like-Minded Entrepreneurs", "text": "May 8, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nOnline communities are the way of the future: They bring people of all ages, backgrounds and hometowns together over a common industry, skill set or interest. I\u2019ve personally been stunned by the impact of an online community from my own experience. My online Facebook community, Elites Mastermind, has over 85,000 members who unite on a daily basis to discuss ecommerce tips and strategies.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Building an Online Community for Your Business\n\nThe impacts are significant. I created my Facebook group to build a virtual community and offer tips, but there are also sales advantages: The University of Michigan found that customers spend 19 percent more after joining a company\u2019s online community. Thanks to this, and the massive potential for consistent engagement, 74 percent of large companies have created online communities, according to research from Demand Metric. For me, however, it\u2019s about amplifying impact. I believe that anyone who has something to say can create an online community of like-minded entrepreneurs and unite them over a common cause. Here\u2019s how to do so, based on my own experience of what works.\n\n1. Share knowledge for free.\n\nThe core element of our group is sharing information at no cost. These tips cover Shopify, Facebook ads, social media marketing, product sourcing, traffic generation and more. Think about the commonalities among all the members of your group. What are individuals joining the community to learn? What interests them most? What are they hoping to accomplish? From there, create the content you know they want to know. Seventy-three percent of consumers report that they trust a brand when they deliver good quality products and services, according to research by Edelman. This extends beyond what you sell as a brand into what you give the consumer consistently. Quality advice, how-to\u2019s and pieces of value within your community develop trust.\n\nPart of this comes down to defining your niche. Generic entrepreneurship communities can work in theory, but they need strong branding and a strong sense of community to bring all of the individuals together. What aspect of entrepreneurship do you want to unite based on?\n\nRelated: 5 Examples Your Brand Can Follow to Build an Online Community\n\n2. Rely on word of mouth.\n\nI\u2019m often asked if I used paid ads to grow my Facebook community, but the honest answer is that all of it was word-of-mouth marketing. This, too, comes back to sharing value. Think about it: If you were part of a community that was sharing endless value, wouldn\u2019t you share it with a friend? At the very least it might come up in a conversation on business strategies, or you may quote the community in a podcast, article or blog post. Ultimately, this word-of-mouth marketing is stronger for your brand than paid ads, because 92 percent of consumers say they trust recommendations from friends and family over any type of advertising, according to Nielsen research. Give your community members something to rave about to their own communities.\n\nWhen just getting started, don\u2019t deny the power of your own word of mouth marketing. You\u2019ve likely established some trust with a few social media followers, friends or family members. Tell them what your community seeks to do and what you\u2019ll share \u2014 this will get the first batch of members in the door.\n\nRelated: 7 Strategies for Achieving Phenomenal Online Community Growth\n\n3. Engage frequently.\n\nCommunities aren\u2019t worth doing if they aren\u2019t supported consistently. Engage frequently \u2014 if not daily, every other day \u2014 because you will become the heartbeat that keeps the community going. Go into your group for a live video, host an \u201cask me anything,\u201d or even facilitate in-person events to build a sense of community. As membership grows and many start posting on their own, more activity will build. But stepping out and letting the members run the show can convey that you don\u2019t care. You also will miss out on a massive opportunity to establish thought leadership within your community.\n\nIt comes down to empowerment, too. Engagement encourages more participation. Every like and comment on a post makes the poster feel that they should share more.\n\nRelated: How to Create Community Among Your Customers\n\n4. Share in other groups as well.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to think of community as something that extends beyond the walls of your Facebook group. I consistently show up in other Facebook groups to share value, because a key part of community building is building relationships outside of the community you already have. The way I see it, everyone benefits: Those who I connect with can then join my community and share their unique perspective and expertise with the group.

Supply chains have been disrupted. People are staying home. Many businesses that rely on traditional sources of revenue are not able to stay open. For solopreneurs, the pain can be even more acute.\n\nRecessions traditionally impact small businesses disproportionately, as we saw in 2008, when they accounted for 45 percent of employment but 62 percent of jobs lost. And it\u2019s even worse for businesses with under 10 employees or young businesses period. Solopreneurs almost always fall into one of these categories and often both. And this current downturn seems to be following a similar trend, with nearly 80 percent of small businesses negatively impacted. Fifty-four percent have dealt with slower . No matter your sector, you\u2019re probably going to be dealing with fallout, but there is hope, and there are ways that solopreneurs can still thrive.\n\nCut your marketing back as little as possible \u2014 grow it if you can\n\nWhen a recession hits and money gets tight, many companies decide to cut back wherever they can. Marketing and advertising tend to get hit hard. But did you realize that you might actually be hurting yourself long-term by cutting back your spend?\n\nAs Moz founder Rand Fishkin notes, \u201cDon\u2019t use a sledgehammer, use a scalpel.\u201d Businesses that lower ad spend during a recession tend to see sales fall 20 to 30 percent over the next two years.\n\nMarketing and advertising are the low-hanging fruit if you\u2019re going to tighten your belt, but do it with the mindset of pruning for new growth, not that of a drowning man clinging to a life preserver.\n\nSome studies even suggest that a soft economy may be the best time for businesses to grow their market share. If you\u2019re cutting back while your competitors are pushing ahead, you might lose out once the economy gets back on better footing.\n\nRelated: How to Maximize Your Startup\u2019s Content Marketing Budget\n\nConnect the physical with the digital\n\nSolopreneurs with physical businesses are having a particularly hard time right now as everybody has to stay indoors, but some have been able to pivot by bringing their offering online \u2014 or as online as they can.\n\nKajabi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Build Together\u201d campaign has been collecting stories from its users, and many of them deal with exactly this.

Physical trainers are doing seminars from their home gyms. The advantage of being a is that you\u2019re more nimble than most businesses.

The company that put direct-to-consumer eyeglasses on the map didn\u2019t start in good economic times \u2014 it actually started during a recession.\n\nCo-founder Dave Gilboa had to buy a new smartphone and a new pair of glasses around the same time and wondered why the glasses cost so much more than the phone. That thought coalesced into what became Warby Parker, and the rest is history, as they say.\n\nWhy did it succeed? The company provided a product people wanted at a cost below what anyone else could offer. No one to that point had been providing stylish eyeglasses for the price Warby Parker could. While money was tighter, this had a lot of appeal, and it proved resilient when the economy got back on track.\n\nCompanies like Coding Dojo, Stellari and Digital Ocean are pivoting to providing products and services that are required in present circumstances. Some fashion companies are repurposing material to create masks and other PPE, while other tech brands are providing support and free services for hard-hit businesses.\n\nWhen money gets tight and customers are in short supply, you can build a loyal audience by providing real value and helping people.

Even if it seems like you\u2019re losing out in the short-term, you\u2019ll build relationships, appreciation and customers that will last far beyond this moment.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest takeaway from this for solopreneurs: Find ways to stay in business, but make sure you\u2019re providing a benefit that people can really use even while cooped up in their houses or dealing with sickness. This situation won't last forever, but how you respond to it will resonate far into the future.", "author": ["Lucas Miller"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/VR6L5NYBxi8/349820", "published": "2020-05-07T16:35:00", "title": "4 Creative Ideas to Supercharge Your Digital Launch", "text": "May 7, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn my journey as an entrepreneur, I've had many digital launches: my podcast, my line of false lashes, my books, a personal branding workbook and more. What I\u2019ve learned through each launch strategy and execution process is how important it is to be creative. If you're part of a community of , it's likely that someone is launching something on any given day. As exciting as that is to be part of, it can also be a challenge to stand out from the noise and complete your launch in a way that\u2019s specific to your personal brand and the brand of whatever it is that you\u2019re launching.\n\nRelated: This Creative Production Company Launched Almost 25 Years Ago. Its Ability to Evolve With the Market Kept It in Business.\n\nHere are some creative ideas that I\u2019ve put to the test in my own digital launches (specifically, the launch of my false lash line last year that did quite well) that can help you start thinking outside the box about your own upcoming launch. Remember: The more creative and unique you are in your launch strategy, the more eyeballs your launch will get.\n\n1. Unite with ambassadors to share the launch for you\n\nI firmly believe in \u201cgo big or go home.\u201d I\u2019ve had many launches where it felt like I was shouting into the void with just one post across all my social channels, and when I launched my lash company, I just didn\u2019t want it to be like that. So, I gathered a group of lash ambassadors: people who represented my \u201ctarget market\u201d (in this case, makeup and false lash lovers) who could partake in the launch with me. I sent them two pairs of free lashes, asked them to take photos with the glitter lash box and wearing the lashes, and we all posted at the very same time.\n\nRelated: Learn Graphic Design and Launch Your Own Business\n\nIn addition to the added exposure (and the fun!), it was a chance to see my product in all of its diversity. Each of your ambassadors will use or embrace your product a little differently, and seeing everyone\u2019s creative take together creates a full picture of what your product can do. Given, this was a bit easier for me because it was a product that could be worn, but the same principle applies if you\u2019re launching a book or a program. Can you first do a mini launch on a small beta group and give them your product for free in exchange for their inclusion in your concerted launch efforts? The more you give them creative reign over their posts here, the better.\n\n2. Creative, bold digital assets\n\nIn a digital launch, the more creative you can be with your fonts, color scheme, social media posts and landing page, the better. I was recently talking with Layla Parr, the founder of the Launch Societe, a company that focuses specifically on launches. I loved her language about what she helps female founders do: \u201cCombine her warring energies into a harmonious launch.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m certainly not a graphic designer, but I have been able to create the digital assets for each of my launches. Parr told me that her best advice is to \u201creach for the highest vision for what you want the launch to feel like, then find fonts and colors that can imitate that same feel.\u201d That stuck with me.\n\nRelated: Learn How to Start a Creative Side Hustle as a Photographer\n\nI spent a great deal of time perusing online resources like Creative Market to find fonts that matched my expression. This exploration is important \u2014 I urge you to not just go for the status quo fonts and templates. Make a splash! The bolder the digital assets, the higher the chance that one of your followers will actually pause their mindless scrolling to look at what you\u2019re launching.\n\n3. Make a fun countdown\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your digital assets, create some suspense before you launch. I didn\u2019t tell anyone outside my ambassador group and close friends that I was about to launch my line of lashes. To drum up interest, I posted faded images of me wearing my product in a non-obvious way with the overlaid numbers of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d and then \u201c1\u201d leading up to the launch day. I put the date of the launch in the caption, too. This suspense creates a sense of investment for your audience. The more they can wonder about what's coming and feel excited about it, the more momentous your launch will feel.\n\n4. Host a giveaway\n\nFinally, a few weeks after the launch, consider hosting a giveaway on your social channels to stir up enthusiasm again. Give away anywhere from one to five of your products or seats in your upcoming course, and ask followers to enter by tagging friends and liking the photo. This will enhance your product\u2019s visibility even more. I also found that doing this giveaway was a great way to engage audience members who weren\u2019t initially interested in my product or service in the heat of the launch but would be interested in trying it for free if they won the giveaway. This way, you don\u2019t lose or delay any purchases from people who were going to buy to begin with. It just reignites enthusiasm in the \"middle tier\" of your audience members who need an extra push to invest in your product.\n\nTry these ideas out for yourself, or put your own spin on them. Digital launches are my favorite because there are no boundaries to how creative you can be. Show the world what you\u2019re made of, and make them pay attention. Your launch deserves it.\n\nRelated: 3 Memorable Ways to Launch a Product to Wow Customers", "author": ["Haley Hoffman Smith"]}]}, "reuters_money": {"rss": "http://feeds.reuters.com/news/wealth/", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/finance/personal-finance", "articles": [{"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/tpvs8WiSA_8/northern-trust-shutting-fund-an-outlier-or-sign-of-future-risk-idUSKBN22W20X", "published": "2020-05-20T20:59:11", "title": "Northern Trust shutting fund; an outlier or sign of future risk?", "text": "FILE PHOTO: An employee walks past a company logo at Northern Trust offices in London, Britain August 1, 2019.

Remember that benefits are backdated, so if approved, you\u2019ll get back unemployment from the date you applied. In the meantime, can you ask for forbearance in credit card payments, car notes, or your mortgage or rent? Can you use your stimulus check, or, if necessary, emergency savings or low-interest credit cards to bridge the gap?\u201d\n\n\u2014 Janet Alvarez, executive editor of Wise Bread\n\nWhat are the best resources available to laid-off workers?\n\n\u201cThe best resources are the ones you ask for. Many people get overwhelmed and stuck, and feel bad about asking for help. Right now, get on the phone with everyone you owe and ask what help is available.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Beth Pinsker, Reuters journalist and a certified financial planner\n\nWhat tips do you have for anyone who is having trouble paying their bills (mortgage, rent, student loans, auto and credit, etc.) right now?\n\n\u201cIf possible, work with creditors directly. Landlords are aware that a tenant that is paying partial rent is better than no tenant at all. Negotiate as best you can, we\u2019re all in the same boat.\u201d\n\n\u2014Patrick Gourley, assistant professor of economics at University of New Haven\n\nHow can laid-off workers make the best use of their time in terms of training and upskilling? Is there anything else they should be doing?\n\n\u201cThis can be your moment to refine, expand, or even discover talents and skills. Perhaps an online class (many are free), guidance from a business coach, jumping back into that passion you put on hold or using this time to rest and recharge.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Jody Thompson, co-creator of the Results-Only Work Environment\n\nWhere should unemployed workers turn for healthcare coverage? Do you advise using COBRA or can they get a better deal elsewhere?\n\n\u201cYou\u2019ll likely have better deals than COBRA at NY State of Health. Sign up for Medicaid, Essential Plan, Qualified Health Plans depending on income and other factors.\u201d\n\n\u2014 The Legal Aid Society (New York)\n\nWhat financial moves should employees who have been furloughed or experienced salary cuts in recent weeks make now?\n\n\u201cWork sharing is a win-win for employers and employees \u2013 employers get to retain trained workers and workers can work and get unemployment insurance benefits, plus the $600. Ask your boss about work sharing as an alternative to layoffs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project\n\nWhat benefits are available to contractors or gig-economy workers who have seen their salaries disappear?\n\n\u201cContractors, check with your state to see if they\u2019ve extended benefits. States like Oregon and others have expanded benefits to include contractors and gig workers. California also approved contractors to receive benefits through pandemic unemployment assistance.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Raymond Lee, founder and chief executive of Careerminds\n\nAny guidance on looking for a job?\n\n\u201cLean on your network.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nRest assured there are options, even if they are all expensive.\n\nIf you are losing a workplace plan, you will get paperwork explaining your benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, which allows you to continue on your same plan. The catch is that you have to pay the full amount of the premiums, not just the employee portion.\n\n\u201cThe employer was typically paying 50 to 100% of the cost, that\u2019s why COBRA is so expensive,\u201d said Anthony Lopez, vice president of operations for eHealth.com https://www.ehealthinsurance.com, a nationwide aggregator.\n\nLopez said most people calling eHealth now are looking for other options besides COBRA, and that means going through the state exchanges, private insurance or short-term plans. You can also go to state websites, healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov or directly to insurance companies to find rates for your personal situation.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d Lopez said, mostly because they fear they will not be able to get health insurance.\n\nLopez said he was not seeing denials, which is reassuring, but then the fear turns into sticker shock.\n\nThe key to picking the best plan is to figure out if it is better to pay less for the premium, but more of the actual cost of the care through a high deductible - and which level to choose.\n\nThe average monthly premium for 2020 was $456 for individuals and $1,134 for families, according to eHealth\u2019s latest analysis. Deductibles averaged $4,263 for individuals and $7,893 for families, meaning this is how much they would have to pay out of pocket, excluding services like well visits for children, before the insurance starts to pay.\n\nOptions for high-deductible plans have been prevalent for years, even through employer plans, but many would have these costs offset by the employer paying a big chunk of the premium and also contributing a lump sum toward the deductible.\n\nHelp might be available for premium reductions for those who qualify for government subsidies. The math will be a little tricky right now though, because the calculation is based on your last tax return. If you estimate your income based on your job loss, and then you get another job, you may owe a penalty, Lopez warned.\n\nDEALING WITH DEDUCTIBLES\n\nIt is not just Americans facing job losses who have to face the reality of high deductibles because of COVID-19. Those still on their workplace plans, who may have been furloughed but are able to keep their insurance, are having to manage their costs more than ever.\n\nResearchers at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy studied what happens financially to people who switch from traditional health plans to high-deductible plans, and found there was a significant increase in out-of-pocket spending and excessive financial burden.\n\n\u201cIf you are healthy and lucky, then a high deductible is a great thing for you,\u201d said Neeraj Sood, a professor at USC who worked on the study.\n\nNone of us is very lucky right now, however.\n\nIn reality, it is very easy to rip through a deductible of several thousand dollars. A couple of trips to urgent care at full price or an afternoon in an emergency room could do it.\n\nEven if the test for COVID-19 is a covered expense, there are all sorts of other costs you could face if you fall ill, and you are on the hook for normal healthcare costs too.\n\nIt takes advance planning to properly deal with these expenses, and that will not be something everyone can pull off with stretched finances.\n\nJeff Hicks, a certified financial planner from Illinois, is one model. He has had a $10,000 family deductible plan for nearly 20 years, and each year religiously puts aside the full amount of the deductible in a Health Savings Account, which is a specialized pre-tax account that also grows tax-free.\n\nFor the first four years, he spent none of it. Then his wife got very sick, and they went the next four years spending the full amount. Since then, they have gone back and forth on the spending.\n\n\u201cOnce she had this catastrophic deal, I knew we were looking at potentially having it every year. I resigned myself to the fact that this may be the path we\u2019re on,\u201d Hicks said.", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/0g2D71vYeK8/scaramuccis-skybridge-hit-with-heavy-redemption-requests-as-fund-fell-letter-idUSKCN22634P", "published": "2020-04-24T20:23:18", "title": "Scaramucci's SkyBridge hit with heavy redemption requests as fund fell: letter", "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors in SkyBridge Capital asked for hundreds of millions of dollars back after the fund suffered a 23% loss in March when investments made by its debt-focused hedge fund managers soured, Anthony Scaramucci wrote in a letter to clients, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the loss.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Anthony Scaramucci, Founder and Co-Managing Partner at SkyBridge Capital, speaks during the opening remarks during the SALT conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. May 17, 2017.

Do not share this,\u201d advised Gaines, who is an enrolled agent based in Richmond, Virginia.\n\nThe Economic Impact Payments to individuals are technically refundable tax credits on your 2020 return, which means they exist separately from whatever your tax liability will be for that year. When you file your return, there will be some kind of worksheet to input the payment you already received and it will tally up the correct amount you should have received.\n\nIf you got too little, you will receive the difference. If you got too much, you get to keep it. (Yes, keep it, no strings attached.)\n\nKubey revisited the language from the 2008 return, when there was a similar stimulus payment following the financial crash. \u201cThe instructions pretty clearly said: if you got too much, you don\u2019t have to pay it back.\u201d\n\n\u2018THIS DOES NOT MAKE SENSE!\u2019\n\n\u201cNo, it doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d said Alan Pinck, an enrolled agent based in San Jose, California.

She got married in 2019 and filed a return with her new husband, who has one child. They got a payment for two adults and three children.\n\nDivorced couples who alternate claiming their children or who split the children may have some reconciling to do.\n\nPeople who had children before the end of 2020, or whose children turn 17 in this time frame, will also have wonky math.\n\nThose who made more or less in any of the years used to calculate the payments will have to work it out in 2020.\n\n\u201cI truly do not believe that Congress realized that there are so many different scenarios for this money,\u201d said enrolled agent Morris Armstrong, based in Connecticut.\n\nWHY DO WE HAVE TO WAIT?\n\nIf you need money now, it is no solace to be told that this will all be resolved in a year, but that is the only true answer right now.\n\n\u201cWe can do the math, but we don\u2019t know with any certainty what the IRS is actually doing,\u201d Gaines said. \u201cThey are just an agency doing what they are told.

Yet he believes \u201cthere are still ways to play this\u201d even though \u201cno one knows how long it will take for demand to come back,\u201d he said.\n\nHe has been buying shares of Scorpio Tankers Inc, which has seen a surge in demand as traders hunt for storage capacity. Shares are up 65% over the last month but remain down 40.5% year to date. He is also seeking companies with low debt and strong cash flows such as Texas Pacific Land Trust, which reaps royalties from its portfolio of oil fields.\n\n\u201cYou know this company will come back, it\u2019s just a matter of timing,\u201d Marshall said.\n\nSome investors remain bearish that oil and energy stocks will ever come back.

In one of the new studies, researchers infected nine monkeys with the new coronavirus. After they recovered, the team exposed them to the virus again and the animals did not get sick. In the second study, the same researchers treated 25 monkeys with experimental vaccines and then exposed them to the coronavirus. In the vaccinated animals, \"we saw a substantial degree of protection,\" Dr. Dan Barouch told Reuters. Barouch, a researcher at the Center for Virology and Vaccine Research at Harvard's Beth Israel Deaconness Medical Center in Boston, and his colleagues published both studies on Wednesday in the journal Science.

In one study, reported in the journal AIP Physics of Fluids, researchers who simulated breezes and winds calculated that under the right conditions, some saliva droplets could travel as far as 18 feet (six meters) from a coughing or sneezing person. The other report, in the Journal of Aerosol Science, also concludes that the current six-feet social-distancing policy \"is not sufficient to protect people\" against coronavirus exposure from coughs when it is breezy or windy. It is not known exactly how much virus it takes for a person to become infected. While studies like these are \"important thought experiments,\" they may not reflect what is happening in the real world, Dr. Amesh Adalja, from the Johns Hopkins Center for Health Security in Baltimore told Reuters. \"What we see in the real world is transmission when there is prolonged close contact, such as when people are living in the same household. I don't think this is a cause to change the public health practices regarding six feet being the distance you want to be separated from another individual.\" (bit.ly/2WM8hwk, bit.ly/2XizYvL)\n\nOlder noses may be more welcoming to coronavirus\n\nNew studies show that the nose may hold the answers to why children seem less vulnerable to infection with the new coronavirus, and why loss of smell is a COVID-19 symptom. One study, published on Wednesday in JAMA, found that in older people, the cells that line the inside of the nose produce more of the cell-surface protein the virus uses to enter the body, called angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2). A second study, conducted in mice, found that not only did nasal cells in older mice make more ACE2, but they also made more of the enzyme TMPRSS2, which the virus also needs to break into cells. Moreover, the researchers said on Wednesday in the journal ACS Chemical Neuroscience, ACE2 and TMPRSS2 are produced by the same nasal cavity cells that contribute to odor detection, which could explain why partial or total loss of the sense of smell is often an early COVID-19 symptom.

In a report on Tuesday in The New England Journal of Medicine, doctors at a large health system in northern California said that since early March, weekly rates of hospitalization for heart attacks have been down by nearly half. Earlier this month, researchers who looked at U.S. national stroke data reported in the Journal that in late March and early April, emergency radiology tests to evaluate stroke patients were down by nearly 40% from prior to the pandemic. Even an excruciatingly painful condition known as aortic dissection is being seen less often. At 11 New York City hospitals, rates of aortic dissection were down 76% in March and April compared to the previous two years, researchers reported in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. When patients delay care for heart attacks and strokes, they have more complications. With strokes in particular, timely treatment is essential. \"We need to get the message out. Hospitals are fully prepared to care of people without COVID-19, and can do so safely,\" Dr. Harlan Krumholz of Yale University in New Haven, Connecticut, told Reuters. \"It would be tragic for people to die at home when they could have been helped.\" (bit.ly/2Xfy6Ur, bit.ly/2TpVLAl, bit.ly/2TqUedr)", "author": ["Nancy Lapid", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/in71ABp-bAc/nasa-human-spaceflight-chief-resigns-ahead-of-launch-idUSKBN22V31C", "published": "2020-05-20T03:21:34", "title": "NASA human spaceflight chief resigns ahead of launch", "text": "Workers pressure wash the logo of NASA on the Vehicle Assembly Building before SpaceX will send two NASA astronauts to the International Space Station aboard its Falcon 9 rocket, at the Kennedy Space Center in Cape Canaveral, Florida, U.S., May 19, 2020.

Among 154 coronavirus patients at two nursing homes, those who took a statin, such as Lipitor, were nearly three times more likely to be free of symptoms during their infection than those who did not, researchers in Belgium found. There was also slight trend toward lower risks for lengthy hospital stays and death that was not statistically significant. The study was not randomized, so more formal trials are needed to definitively prove that statins affect outcomes. \"In the current absence of other valuable therapies and considering the benefit-risk balance, an older person living in a nursing home could consider taking a statin if at high COVID-19 infection risk,\" the authors advised. The study, reported on Friday on the medRxiv website, has not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2X3K57g)\n\nCOVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease\n\nThe desperate need of severely ill coronavirus patients for mechanical ventilators to help them breathe had led many people to think of COVID-19 primarily as a respiratory disease, at least in adults. But among nearly 5,500 coronavirus patients in the largest New York health system, more than one in three hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed acute kidney injuries, and nearly 15% required dialysis, researchers reported on Thursday in the medical journal Kidney International. Other research teams have reported that the virus can infect cells in the small intestine. And on Wednesday, researchers reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that autopsies of 27 people who died of COVID-19 showed the virus in tissues of 17 hearts, 17 livers, 8 brains and the kidneys of 13 people.

It is not yet clear whether or to what extent convalescent plasma provides benefit, but a large study shows the treatment is safe. U.S. researchers analyzed data from 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening coronavirus infections who received the treatment as part of a U.S. FDA Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma for COVID-19 patients. Fewer than 1% of patients had any serious adverse effects in the first four hours after transfusion, researchers found. The findings, published on Thursday on the medRxiv website, have not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2AA7hml)\n\nFlu data can help coronavirus case estimates; less reliable for deaths\n\nOne way to get a better sense of how the coronavirus spread in the United States, researchers suggest, is to look at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on the number of people with flu-like symptoms and estimate how many of them were actually diagnosed with the flu. The ones who were not may have had coronavirus infections instead. Researchers looked at the number of prescriptions for oseltamivir, an antiviral specifically used to treat influenza. According to their report on Friday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, when they compared the CDC-reported flu-like illness levels with their estimate of actual flu diagnoses based on oseltamivir prescriptions, they concluded that by April 4 there were already more than 2.5 million coronavirus cases in the United States.

Most people do not realize that CDC numbers for influenza deaths are just estimates, whereas COVID-19 deaths numbers are actual counts, Dr. Jeremy Faust of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters. Writing in JAMA Internal Medicine on Thursday, he and a coauthor say that between the 2013-2014 and 2018-2019 flu seasons, the estimated annual number of flu deaths ranged from 23,000 to 61,000 - but over the same period, the yearly number of counted influenza deaths was between 3,448 and 15,620. In contrast, during just the week ending April 21, 2020, there were 15,455 U.S. COVID-19 deaths reported.

This means authorities have only limited information about how widespread the new coronavirus is or whether it is affecting some communities more than others.\n\n\u201cYou can use this type of surveillance as a public health tool,\u201d said Andrew Singer, a researcher at the UK Centre for Ecology and Hydrology who is working with Davey and others on pilot coronavirus sewage testing plans in Britain.\n\n\u201cAnd the utility of this approach is that it\u2019s so cheap and the investment that you make ... will reap rewards, not just for (this) coronavirus pandemic,\u201d but for future outbreaks too.", "author": ["Kate Kelland", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/mGr340zxvJo/twin-antibodies-may-help-fight-coronavirus-normal-speech-may-spread-virus-idUSKBN22P2T9", "published": "2020-05-13T21:12:47", "title": "Twin antibodies may help fight coronavirus; normal speech may spread virus", "text": "(Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A woman holds a small bottle labeled with a \"Vaccine COVID-19\" sticker and a medical syringe in this illustration taken April 10, 2020.

Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. \"There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,\" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (bit.ly/3fJIRqp)\n\nTwin antibodies may be better than one\n\nScientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a \"cocktail\" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (bit.ly/2WsbD7b)\n\nChildren with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kids\n\nChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. \u201cIt was reassuring that they didn\u2019t appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,\u201d Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. \u201cWith this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAmong children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children\u2019s asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. \u201cEven in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,\u201d Kung said. \u201cThis suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.\u201d\n\n(bit.ly/3cuDM3j)\n\nScientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genome\n\nResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. \"This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,\" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. \"The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes.\" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/3buhU6A)\n\nCoronavirus particles in feces may not be infectious\n\nThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

Tsenka Tsanova/Handout via REUTERS\n\nResearchers said DNA from the five fossils from Bulgaria\u2019s Bacho Kiro cave demonstrated they belonged to anatomically modern Homo sapiens. This evidence resolved a debate over who made a remarkable array of artifacts at the site including stone and bone tools and pendants made of the teeth of cave bears - it was our species in the cave and not Neanderthals.\n\nThe research pushes back by thousands of years the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe, a milestone in the history of a species that arose in Africa about 300,000 years ago and then spread worldwide.\n\nHuman remains from the cave range from 43,000 to 46,000 years old while associated artifacts were up to 47,000 years old, said paleoanthropologist Jean-Jacques Hublin, director of the Department of Human Evolution at the Max Planck Institute for Evolutionary Anthropology in Germany.\n\n\u201cIt looks like this is the time of the earliest wave of modern humans in the mid-latitudes of Eurasia,\u201d Hublin added, with evidence existing of Homo sapiens presence relatively soon after at similar latitudes from Moravia to Mongolia.\n\nNeanderthals - more robustly built than Homo sapiens - had already inhabited Europe for hundreds of thousands of years. Hublin said the new findings indicate the two species overlapped for perhaps 8,000 years before the Neanderthals went extinct.\n\nThere is a debate over what doomed the Neanderthals, including the possibility that our species wiped them out after thousands of years of interactions including interbreeding that left an indelible mark on the human genome.\n\n\u201cIn my view, Neanderthals disappeared from Europe because of the competition with our species. However, this did not occur overnight,\u201d said Hublin, lead author of research published in the journal Nature alongside a second study in Nature Ecology & Evolution.\n\nAnimal remains in the cave revealed hunting and butchering of cave bears, bison, giant deer, horses, hyenas and lions.\n\nArtifacts include pointed flint blades and numerous personal ornaments including a bead made of mammoth ivory and the bear-tooth pendants. Those pendants have striking similarities to ones made later by Neanderthals in western Europe, indicating our closest evolutionary cousins adopted aspects of Homo sapiens culture.\n\n\u201cThe DNA evidence is now secure that Neanderthals and Homo sapiens interacted when they came into contact with one another.

Researchers have found that men have higher blood levels of the enzyme that helps the virus infect cells. The higher levels of \"angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,\" or ACE2, in men's blood might mean their organs have more of the ACE2 \"receptors\" the virus uses to get into cells, researchers suggest in a paper published on Monday in European Heart Journal. Their study involved more than 2,000 elderly men and women with heart failure but no coronavirus infection, many of whom were taking common blood pressure drugs that block the effect of this enzyme, known as ACE2 inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The researchers emphasize that study participants receiving these medications did not have higher levels of ACE2, which adds to earlier evidence that the drugs do not increase people's risk for coronavirus infection. (bit.ly/2AgF5Vb;bit.ly/2Ajdl2m)\n\nAdding interferon may boost effectiveness of coronavirus treatment\n\nAdding interferon-beta to a cocktail of the antiviral drugs lopinavir, ritonavir and ribavirin helped alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of viral shedding (contagion) and hospital stays of mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 patients, according to results of a small randomized trial conducted at six hospitals in Hong Kong. The time it took for at least half the patients to have negative coronavirus tests was seven days with add-on interferon, compared to 12 days without it, researchers reported on Sunday in The Lancet. Overall, 86 patients received the interferon-containing combination and 41 got the antivirals without interferon. When the study started, half the patients had already been symptomatic for more than five days. The combination that included interferon \"also alleviated symptoms completely within four days - a significantly shorter time than the control,\" researchers said, adding that a larger trial to confirm these results is needed.

The study, which was posted online on Monday on the MedRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed, found fewer than 0.5% of all pregnant women were hospitalized with the disease, and only around 10% of those women needed intensive care. Most pregnant women who were admitted to hospital were more than six months pregnant, the study also found.\n\nA separate study from Sweden, however, found pregnant women there do appear to face higher risks. Swedish national registry data, published on Sunday in the medical journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, showed that compared to nonpregnant women infected with the coronavirus, similarly aged pregnant women with the virus were more than five times as likely to need intensive care and four times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation. The authors of an editorial accompanying the study advise that, \"on the basis of available data...the risk of COVID-19 in pregnancy should not be down-played to avoid falsely reassuring healthcare professionals and the public. Women should be advised to take necessary precautions to avoid infection during pregnancy.\" (;reut.rs/3bqgmdU;bit.ly/35RUB5u;bit.ly/3coDAma)\n\nGraphic: The lifeline pipeline, COVID-19 treatments, vaccines in development here", "author": ["Nancy Lapid", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/zFNwAqG6AoM/abbott-coronavirus-test-is-accurate-infected-mothers-breast-milk-may-protect-infants-idUSKBN22K2GE", "published": "2020-05-08T18:36:57", "title": "Abbott coronavirus test is accurate; infected mother's breast milk may protect infants", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak, shared with Reuters on February 18, 2020.

Researchers at the University of Washington School of Medicine found the test, manufactured by Abbott Laboratories, had a specificity rate of 99.9% and a sensitivity rate of 100%, suggesting little chance of incorrectly diagnosing a healthy person as having been infected and virtually no chance of a false negative readout. Abbott's test has received emergency use authorization from the FDA and the company has already shipped more than 10 million of the tests to hospitals and labs.

British physicians reporting on Thursday in The Lancet said the children initially have fever, rash, conjunctivitis, lower-limb swelling, pain in arms and legs, and \"significant\" gastrointestinal symptoms, even without testing positive for the coronavirus. The syndrome, while rare, can rapidly progress to critical illness requiring mechanical ventilation.

Some of the men were already recovering from their illness.\n\n\"If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention,\" doctors at China's Shangqiu Municipal Hospital wrote in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Thursday, adding that more research is needed.

They reanalyzed specimens from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 whose test results had been negative or unclear and found less human DNA than they expected to see. Correct use of nasopharyngeal swabs to obtain a high quality specimen \"requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to ... a depth of roughly 7 centimeters (2.76 inches), followed by rotation and withdrawal,\" Zabrina Brumme of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and colleagues say.

By contrast, public health measures like social distancing, school closures and sheltering at home do make a difference and were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth, Dr. Peter Juni at the University of Toronto and colleagues found in a report published on Friday in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).\n\n\"The important effect of public health interventions needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions,\" Juni's team concluded in their report.

Now, as major economies prepare green investments to kickstart growth, advocates spy a golden chance to drag the niche energy into the mainstream of a post-pandemic world.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The new Febus hydrogen bus is seen before a presentation in Pau, France, January 14, 2020. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nGreen hydrogen was pushed to the fore last week when Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said the technology was \u201cready for the big time\u201d and urged governments to channel investments into the fuel.\n\nSome countries, including the Netherlands, Australia and Portugal, have already begun investing in the technology. Now investors, politicians and businesses are pushing the European Union and others to use its post-crisis recovery plan to support hydrogen in areas like trucking and heavy industry.\n\nThe promise of hydrogen as a fuel to help power vehicles and energy plants has been a talking point since the 1970s, but it is currently too expensive for widespread use. Proponents say infrastructure investment and more demand from transport, gas grids and industry will bring the cost down.\n\nMost hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions, which defeats the object for many policymakers. But there is potential to extract \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity.\n\nEU officials, one of whom described green hydrogen as the \u201choly grail\u201d, said it could replace fossil fuels in sectors that lack alternatives to align operations with the EU\u2019s Green Deal plan to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cHydrogen could solve a lot of problems. We need everything else as well but the political interest is because to achieve deep energy efficiency and decarbonisation, hydrogen seems relatively easy,\u201d said Jesse Scott, senior advisor at think-tank Agora Energiewende.\n\n\u201cIt is less alarming (for policymakers) than some other elements for meeting net zero,\u201d she added, such as carbon removal technology for example.\n\nHYDROGEN GAINING MOMENTUM\n\nMomentum appears to be building; EU industry chief Thierry Breton met hydrogen companies online this week to discuss the bloc\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe could use these circumstances, where loads of public money are going to be needed into the energy system, to jump forward towards a hydrogen economy,\u201d said Diederik Samsom, who heads the European Commission\u2019s climate cabinet.\n\nThis could result in hydrogen use scaling up faster than was expected before the pandemic, he added.\n\nThe European Commission has earmarked clean hydrogen - a loose term which can include gas-based hydrogen, if fitted with technology to capture the resulting emissions - as a \u201cpriority area\u201d for industry in its Green Deal.\n\nOver the past year, several governments, including Germany, Britain, Australia and Japan, have announced or have been working on hydrogen strategies and the pace has picked up over the past month during the pandemic.\n\nThis week, Australia set aside A$300 million ($191 million) to jumpstart hydrogen projects. Portugal plans to build a new solar-powered hydrogen plant which will produce hydrogen by electrolysis by 2023.\n\nThe Netherlands unveiled a hydrogen strategy in late March, outlining plans for 500 megawatts (MW) of green electrolyser capacity by 2025. A German hydrogen strategy is expected later this month.\n\nThe Dutch government is pushing for the EU to follow suit and present an \u201caction plan\u201d for clean hydrogen, a spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nCAN IT BECOME AFFORDABLE?\n\nWhen it comes to transport, hydrogen fuel cells trail electric batteries in the push for greener cars, given their higher price and the lack of refuelling stations. But proponents see potential for heavier vehicles.\n\nDaimler and Volvo Trucks unveiled plans last month to bring hydrogen fuelled heavy-duty vehicles to market within the decade.\n\nHydrogen gas is already used in industry to produce ammonia, which goes into fertilisers, and methanol, used to make plastic.\n\nA major drawback of the green hydrogen that governments are most interested in, is that it requires a large amount of renewable electricity to produce. The good news is, renewables prices have fallen sharply in recent years.\n\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, hydrogen made from fossil fuels currently costs between $1-$1.8/kg. Green hydrogen can cost around $6/kg today, making it significantly more expensive than the fossil fuel alternatives.\n\nHowever, increased demand could reduce the cost of electrolysis. Coupled with falling renewable energy costs, green hydrogen could fall to $1.7/kg by 2050 and possibly sub-$1/kg, making it competitive with natural gas. Higher carbon prices would also encourage the shift.\n\n\u201cClean hydrogen produced from electricity is around three times more expensive than that from natural gas, but solar and wind costs have decreased in recent years and if they continue to fall, clean hydrogen produced with lower electricity costs would become more affordable,\u201d said Philippe Vie, global energy and utilities lead at consultancy Capgemini.\n\n\u201cOn hydrogen we are right now where we were with renewables in 2000-2005. Ten to 15 years is probably a good time lapse to become competitive,\u201d he added.\n\nMAJOR MONEY NEEDED\n\nAny serious attempt at large-scale use - either in industry or transportation - would also require major infrastructure investments. For example, power from an offshore wind farm would need to be connected to an electrolyser that produces the green hydrogen, which would then need to be transported to end users.\n\nEurope has around 135 MW of electrolyser capacity, but planned green hydrogen projects could bring that to 5.2 gigawatts, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie.

Patients who got this treatment were more likely to survive, the researchers reported on Wednesday in the Journal of the American College of Cardiology. The difference was most pronounced among the 395 patients who needed mechanical ventilation. In this group, the death rate was 63% without anticoagulants and 29% when patients did get blood thinners.\n\nThe researchers note that because the study was not randomized, it cannot prove the drugs directly led to better survival.

The draft pact has not been formally shared with U.S. allies yet.\n\nThe Trump administration and other spacefaring countries see the moon as a key strategic asset in outer space. The moon also has value for long-term scientific research that could enable future missions to Mars - activities that fall under a regime of international space law widely viewed as outdated.\n\nThe Artemis Accords, named after the National Aeronautics and Space Administration\u2019s new Artemis moon program, propose \u201csafety zones\u201d that would surround future moon bases to prevent damage or interference from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity.\n\nThe pact also aims to provide a framework under international law for companies to own the resources they mine, the sources said.\n\nIn the coming weeks, U.S. officials plan to formally negotiate the accords with space partners such as Canada, Japan, and European countries, as well as the United Arab Emirates, opening talks with countries the Trump administration sees as having \u201clike-minded\u201d interests in lunar mining.\n\nRussia, a major partner with NASA on the International Space Station, won\u2019t be an early partner in these accords, the sources said, as the Pentagon increasingly views Moscow as hostile for making \u201cthreatening\u201d satellite maneuvers toward U.S. spy satellites in Earth orbit.\n\nThe United States is a member of the 1967 Outer Space Treaty and sees the \u201csafety zones\u201d as an implementation of one of its highly debated articles.

Scientists have been trying to answer this question for many years, and thanks to chemical clues left in sediment cores extracted from deep in the ocean floor, they are starting to put together the pieces of that puzzle.\n\nRecent research suggests that there was enhanced storage of respired carbon in the deep ocean when levels of atmospheric carbon dioxide concentrations were lower than today's levels. But new research led by a Texas A&M University scientist has reached back even further, for the first time revealing insights into atmospheric carbon dioxide levels in the 50,000 years before the last ice age.\n\n\"One of the biggest unknowns about past climate is the cause of atmospheric carbon dioxide variability over global warm-cold cycles,\" said Franco Marcantonio, lead author of the study and professor and Jane and Ken R.

If their idea is correct, it suggests that all life throughout the universe could share the same chiral preference.\n\nChirality, also known as handedness, is the existence of mirror-image versions of molecules. Like the left and right hand, two chiral forms of a single molecule reflect each other in shape but don't line up if stacked. In every major biomolecule -- amino acids, DNA, RNA -- life only uses one form of molecular handedness. If the mirror version of a molecule is substituted for the regular version within a biological system, the system will often malfunction or stop functioning entirely. In the case of DNA, a single wrong handed sugar would disrupt the stable helical structure of the molecule.\n\nLouis Pasteur first discovered this biological homochirality in 1848. Since then, scientists have debated whether the handedness of life was driven by random chance or some unknown deterministic influence. Pasteur hypothesized that, if life is asymmetric, then it may be due to an asymmetry in the fundamental interactions of physics that exist throughout the cosmos.\n\n\"We propose that the biological handedness we witness now on Earth is due to evolution amidst magnetically polarized radiation, where a tiny difference in the mutation rate may have promoted the evolution of DNA-based life, rather than its mirror image,\" said No\u00e9mie Globus lead author of the paper and a former Koret Fellow at the Kavli Institute for Particle Astrophysics and Cosmology (KIPAC).\n\nIn their paper, published on May 20 in Astrophysical Journal Letters, the researchers detail their argument in favor of cosmic rays as the origin of homochirality. They also discuss potential experiments to test their hypothesis.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMagnetic polarization from space\n\nCosmic rays are an abundant form of high-energy radiation that originate from various sources throughout the universe, including stars and distant galaxies. After hitting the Earth's atmosphere, cosmic rays eventually degrade into fundamental particles. At ground level, most of the cosmic rays exist only as particles known as muons.\n\nMuons are unstable particles, existing for a mere 2 millionths of a second, but because they travel near the speed of light, they have been detected more than 700 meters below Earth's surface. They are also magnetically polarized, meaning, on average, muons all share the same magnetic orientation. When muons finally decay, they produce electrons with the same magnetic polarization. The researchers believe that the muon's penetrative ability allows it and its daughter electrons to potentially affect chiral molecules on Earth and everywhere else in the universe.\n\n\"We are irradiated all the time by cosmic rays,\" explained Globus, who is currently a post-doctoral researcher at New York University and the Simons Foundation's Flatiron Institute. \"Their effects are small but constant in every place on the planet where life could evolve, and the magnetic polarization of the muons and electrons is always the same. And even on other planets, cosmic rays would have the same effects.\"\n\nThe researchers' hypothesis is that, at the beginning of life of on Earth, this constant and consistent radiation affected the evolution of the two mirror life-forms in different ways, helping one ultimately prevail over the other. These tiny differences in mutation rate would have been most significant when life was beginning and the molecules involved were very simple and more fragile. Under these circumstances, the small but persistent chiral influence from cosmic rays could have, over billions of generations of evolution, produced the single biological handedness we see today.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"This is a little bit like a roulette wheel in Vegas, where you might engineer a slight preference for the red pockets, rather than the black pockets,\" said Roger Blandford, the Luke Blossom Professor in the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford and an author on the paper. \"Play a few games, you would never notice. But if you play with this roulette wheel for many years, those who bet habitually on red will make money and those who bet on black will lose and go away.\"\n\nReady to be surprised\n\nGlobus and Blandford suggest experiments that could help prove or disprove their cosmic ray hypothesis. For example, they would like to test how bacteria respond to radiation with different magnetic polarization.\n\n\"Experiments like this have never been performed and I am excited to see what they teach us. Surprises inevitably come from further work on interdisciplinary topics,\" said Globus.\n\nThe researchers also look forward to organic samples from comets, asteroids or Mars to see if they too exhibit a chiral bias.\n\n\"This idea connects fundamental physics and the origin of life,\" said Blandford, who is also Stanford and SLAC professor of physics and particle physics and former director of KIPAC. \"Regardless of whether or not it's correct, bridging these very different fields is exciting and a successful experiment should be interesting.\"\n\nThis research was funded by the Koret Foundation, New York University and the Simons Foundation.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520131701.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T18:17:01", "title": "Elucidating the mechanism of a light-driven sodium pump", "text": "Researchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have succeeded for the first time in recording, in action, a light-driven sodium pump from bacterial cells. The findings promise progress in the development of new methods in neurobiology. The researchers used the new X-ray free-electron laser SwissFEL for their investigations. They have published their findings today in the journal Nature.\n\nSodium, which is contained in ordinary table salt, plays an essential role in the vital processes of most biological cells. Many cells build up a concentration gradient between their interior and the environment. For this purpose, special pumps in the cell membrane transport sodium out of the cell. With the help of such a concentration gradient, cells of the small intestine or the kidneys, for example, absorb certain sugars.\n\nSuch sodium pumps are also found in the membranes of bacteria. They belong to the family of the so-called rhodopsins. These are special proteins that are activated by light. For example, rhodopsins transport sodium out of the cell in the case of bacteria living in the ocean, such as Krokinobacter eikastus. The crucial component of rhodopsin is the so-called retinal, a form of vitamin A. It is of central importance for humans, animals, certain algae and many bacteria. In the retina of the human eye, for example, retinal initiates the visual process when it changes shape under the influence of light.\n\nLightning-fast movie making\n\nResearchers at the Paul Scherrer Institute PSI have now succeeded capturing images of the sodium pump of Krokinobacter eikastus in action and documenting the molecular changes necessary for sodium transport. To do this, they used a technique called serial femtosecond crystallography. A femtosecond is one-quadrillionth of a second; a millisecond is the thousandth part. The sample to be examined -- in this case a crystallised sodium pump -- is struck first by a laser and then by an X-ray beam. In the case of bacterial rhodopsin, the laser activates the retinal, and the subsequent X-ray beam provides data on structural changes within the entire protein molecule. Since SwissFEL produces 100 of these femtosecond X-ray pulses per second, recordings can be made with high temporal resolution. \"We can only achieve temporal resolution in the femtosecond range at PSI with the help of SwissFEL,\" says Christopher Milne, who helped to develop the Alvra experimental station where the recordings were made. \"One of the challenges is to inject the crystals into the setup so that they meet the pulses of the laser and the X-ray beam with pinpoint accuracy.\"\n\nPump in action\n\nIn the current experiment, the time intervals between the laser and X-ray pulses were between 800 femtoseconds and 20 milliseconds. Each X-ray pulse creates a single image of a protein crystal. And just as a cinema film ultimately consists of a large number of individual photographs that are strung together in a series and played back rapidly, the individual pictures obtained with the help of SwissFEL can be put together to form a kind of film.\n\n\"The process that we were able to observe in our experiment, and which roughly corresponds to the transport of a sodium ion through a cell membrane, takes a total of 20 milliseconds,\" explains J\u00f6rg Standfuss, who heads the group for time-resolved crystallography in the Biology and Chemistry Division at PSI . \"Besides elucidating the transport process, we were also able to show how the sodium pump achieves its specificity for sodium through small changes in its structure.\" This ensures that only sodium ions, and no other positively charged ions, are transported. With these investigations, the researchers also revealed the molecular changes through which the pump prevents sodium ions that have been transported out of the cell from flowing back into it.\n\nAdvances in optogenetics and neurobiology\n\nSince sodium concentration differences also play a special role in the way nerve cells conduct stimuli, neurons have powerful sodium pumps in their membranes. If more sodium flows into the cell's interior, a stimulus is transmitted. These pumps then transport the excess sodium in the cell to the outside again.\n\nSince the sodium pump of Krokinobacter eikastus is driven by light, researchers can now use it for so-called optogenetics. With this technology, cells, in this case nerve cells, are genetically modified in such a way that they can be controlled by light. The pump is installed in nerve cells using methods of molecular genetics. If it is then activated by light, a neuron can no longer transmit stimuli, for example, since this would require an increase in the sodium concentration in the nerve cell. However, bacterial rhodopsin prevents this by continuously transporting sodium out of the cell. Thus active sodium pumps render a neuron inactive.\n\n\"If we understand exactly what is going on in the sodium pump of the bacterium, it can help to improve experiments in optogenetics,\" says Petr Skopintsev, a PhD candidate in the time-resolved crystallography group. \"For example, it can be used to identify variants of bacterial rhodopsin that work more effectively than the form that is usually found in Krokinobacter.\" In addition, the researchers hope to gain insights into how individual mutations can change the ion pumps so that they then transport ions other than sodium.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520131659.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T18:16:59", "title": "3D-printed system speeds up solar cell testing from hours to minutes: Scientists flag dramatic improvement to next-gen perovskite R&D", "text": "Tests on new designs for next-gen solar cells can now be done in hours instead of days thanks to a new system built by scientists at Australia's Monash University, incorporating 3D-printed key components.\n\nThe machine can analyse 16 sample perovskite-based solar cells simultaneously, in parallel, dramatically speeding up the process.\n\nThe invention means that the performance and commercial potential of new compounds can be very rapidly evaluated, significantly speeding up the development process.\n\n\"Third generation perovskite cells have boosted performance to above 25%, which is almost identical to the efficiency level for conventional silicon-based ones,\" said project leader Mr Adam Surmiak from the ARC Centre of Excellence in Exciton Science (Exciton Science).\n\n\"But those results are from laboratory tests on millimetre-sized samples in indoor conditions -- and therefore don't take into account a whole range of real-world factors such as environmental conditions, the use to which the cells are put, the manufacturing process, and possible deterioration over time.\n\n\"To make proper decisions, we need to know how each different cell design will function at large scales in the real world -- and to do that we need a proper data library so we can pick the best candidates to take to that next stage.

Ancient genomes from the region have revealed multiple genetic turnovers and admixture events, indicating that the transition from the Neolithic to the Bronze Age was facilitated by human mobility and complex cultural interactions. The nature and timing of these interactions, however, remains largely unknown.\n\nA new study published in the journal Cell reports the findings of 19 newly sequenced ancient human genomes from the region of Lake Baikal, including one of the oldest reported from that region.

Using an extremely fragmented tooth excavated in 1962 at the Ust-Kyahta-3 site, researchers generated a shotgun-sequenced genome enabled by cutting edge techniques in molecular biology.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis individual from southern Siberia, along with a younger Mesolithic one from northeastern Siberia, shares the same genetic mixture of Ancient North Eurasian (ANE) and Northeast Asian (NEA) ancestry found in Native Americans, and suggests that the ancestry which later gave rise to Native Americans in North- and South America was much more widely distributed than previously assumed. Evidence suggests that this population experienced frequent genetic contacts with NEA populations, resulting in varying admixture proportions across time and space.\n\n\"The Upper Paleolithic genome will provide a legacy to study human genetic history in the future,\" says Cosimo Posth, a senior author of the paper. Further genetic evidence from Upper Paleolithic Siberian groups is necessary to determine when and where the ancestral gene pool of Native Americans came together.\n\nA web of prehistoric connections\n\nIn addition to this transcontinental connection, the study presents connectivity within Eurasia as evidenced in both human and pathogen genomes as well as stable isotope analysis. Combining these lines of evidence, the researchers were able to produce a detailed description of the population history in the Lake Baikal region.\n\nThe presence of Eastern European steppe-related ancestry is evidence of contact between southern Siberian and western Eurasian steppe populations in the preamble to the Early Bronze Age, an era characterized by increasing social and technological complexity. The surprising presence of Yersinia pestis, the plague-causing pathogen, points to further wide-ranging contacts.\n\nAlthough spreading of Y. pestis was postulated to be facilitated by migrations from the steppe, the two individuals here identified with the pathogen were genetically northeastern Asian-like. Isotope analysis of one of the infected individuals revealed a non-local signal, suggesting origins outside the region of discovery. In addition, the strains of Y. pestis the pair carried is most closely related to a contemporaneous strain identified in an individual from the Baltic region of northeastern Europe, further supporting the high mobility of those Bronze age pathogens and likely also people.\n\n\"This easternmost appearance of ancient Y. pestis strains is likely suggestive of long-range mobility during the Bronze Age,\" says Maria Spyrou, one of the study's coauthors. \"In the future, with the generation of additional data we hope to delineate the spreading patterns of plague in more detail.\" concludes Johannes Krause, senior author of the study.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520131653.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T18:16:53", "title": "Team builds hybrid quantum system by entangling molecule with atom", "text": "Physicists at the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) have boosted their control of the fundamental properties of molecules at the quantum level by linking or \"entangling\" an electrically charged atom and an electrically charged molecule, showcasing a way to build hybrid quantum information systems that could manipulate, store and transmit different forms of data.\n\nDescribed in a Nature paper posted online May 20, the new NIST method could help build large-scale quantum computers and networks by connecting quantum bits (qubits) based on otherwise incompatible hardware designs and operating frequencies. Mixed-platform quantum systems could offer versatility like that of conventional computer systems, which, for example, can exchange data among an electronic processor, an optical disc, and a magnetic hard drive.\n\nThe NIST experiments successfully entangled the properties of an electron in the atomic ion with the rotational states of the molecule so that measurements of one particle would control the properties of the other. The research builds on the same group's 2017 demonstration of quantum control of a molecule, which extended techniques long used to manipulate atoms to the more complicated and potentially more fruitful arena offered by molecules, composed of multiple atoms bonded together.\n\nMolecules have various internal energy levels, like atoms, but also rotate and vibrate at many different speeds and angles. Molecules could therefore act as mediators in quantum systems by converting quantum information across a wide range of qubit frequencies ranging from a few thousand to a few trillion cycles per second. With vibration, molecules could offer even higher qubit frequencies.\n\n\"We proved the atomic ion and molecular ion are entangled, and we also showed you get a broad selection of qubit frequencies in the molecule,\" NIST physicist James (Chin-wen) Chou said.\n\nA qubit represents the digital data bits 0 and 1 in terms of two different quantum states, such as low- and high-energy levels in an atom. A qubit can also exist in a \"superposition\" of both states at once. The NIST researchers entangled two energy levels of a calcium atomic ion with two different pairs of rotational states of a calcium hydride molecular ion, which is a calcium ion bonded to a hydrogen atom. The molecular qubit had a transition frequency -- the speed of cycling between two rotational states -- of either low energy at 13.4 kilohertz (kHz, thousands of cycles per second) or high energy at 855 billion cycles per second (gigahertz or GHz).\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Molecules provide a selection of transition frequencies and we can choose from many types of molecules, so that is a huge range of qubit frequencies we can bring into quantum information science,\" Chou said. \"We are taking advantage of transitions found in nature so the results will be the same for everyone.\"\n\nThe experiments used a specific formula of blue and infrared laser beams of various intensities, orientations and pulse sequences to cool, entangle and measure the quantum states of the ions.\n\nFirst, the NIST researchers trapped and cooled the two ions to their lowest-energy states. The pair repelled each other due to their physical proximity and positive electric charges, and the repulsion acted like a spring locking their motion. Laser pulses added energy to the molecule's rotation and created a superposition of low-energy and high-energy rotational states, which also set off a shared motion, so the two ions began rocking or swinging in unison, in this case in opposite directions.\n\nThe molecule's rotation was thus entangled with its motion. More laser pulses exploited the two ions' shared motion to induce the atomic ion into a superposition of low and high energy levels. In this way, entanglement was transferred from the motion to encompass the atom. The researchers determined the state of the atomic ion by shining a laser on it and measuring its fluorescence, or how much light it scattered.\n\nThe NIST researchers demonstrated the technique with two sets of the molecule's rotational properties, successfully achieving entanglement 87% of the time with a low-energy pair (qubit) and 76% of the time with a higher-energy pair. In the low-energy case, the molecule rotated at two slightly different angles, like a top, but in both states at once. In the high-energy case, the molecule was spinning at two rates simultaneously, separated by a large difference in speed.\n\nThe new work was made possible by the quantum logic techniques shown in the 2017 experiment. The researchers applied pulses of infrared laser light to drive switching between two of more than 100 possible rotational states of the molecule. The researchers knew this transition occurred because a certain amount of energy was added to the two ions' shared motion. The researchers knew the ions were entangled based on the light signals given off by the atomic ion.\n\nThe new methods could be used with a wide range of molecular ions composed of different elements, offering a broad selection of qubit properties.\n\nThe approach could connect different types of qubits operating at different frequencies, such as atoms and superconducting systems or light particles, including those in telecommunications and microwave components.

This has enabled them to measure the influence of the molecule itself on the kinetics of emission.\n\nPhotoemission -- the release of electrons in response to excitation by light -- is one of the most fundamental processes in the microcosm. The kinetic energy of the emitted electron is characteristic for the atom concerned, and depends on the wavelength of the light employed. But how long does the process take? And does it always take the same amount of time, irrespective of whether the electron is emitted from an individual atom or from an atom that is part of a molecule? An international team of researchers led by laser physicists in the Laboratory for Attosecond Physics (LAP) at LMU Munich and the Max Planck Institute of Quantum Optics (MPQ) in Garching has now probed the influence of the molecule on photoemission time.\n\nThe theoretical description of photoemission in 1905 by Albert Einstein marked a breakthrough in quantum physics, and the details of the process are of continuing interest in the world of science and beyond.

The measured times were in the range of tens of attoseconds. One attosecond is a billionth of a billionth of a second.\n\nThe researchers used a range of pulses in the x-ray region to excite the targeted electron. The use of machine learning helped to improve the precision of the analysis of the experimental data, and resulted in more accurate comparisons with theoretical predictions. \"The comparison of the experimental data with theoretical simulations finally revealed the influence of the molecule on the time that electrons need for the photoemission process,\" explains Professor Matthias Kling, who heads the Ultrafast Imaging and Nanophotonics group within the LAP team. The researchers found that the delay attributable to the molecular environment became larger as the energy of the light pulses -- and hence the initial kinetic energy imparted to the electrons -- was reduced.\n\nThe observations may be compared with exploring a landscape. When flying over it, many details on the ground remain unnoticed. At ground level, every single bump makes itself felt. The same is true for excited electrons. If the initial impulse is just enough to enable them to leave the molecule, the retarding effect of the forces that hold the molecule together is greater than when the 'kick' is sufficiently energetic to eject them more promptly.\n\n\"Our observations indicate that experiments tracing photoemission time permit us to learn about the forces within molecules,\" explains Professor Abdallah Azzeer, Head of the Laboratory for Attosecond Physics at KSU in Riyadh. \"These studies could improve our understanding of quantum effects in molecules and chemical reactions,\" adds Prof. Alexandra Landsman from Ohio State University in the US, who leads the group that conducted the majority of the theoretical work.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520125004.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T17:50:04", "title": "'Bee' thankful for the evolution of pollen: Researchers discover wildflower's spiny pollen adapts to help plants reproduce", "text": "Have pollen.

Using a highly detailed electron scanning microscope, the research team could observe the microscopic surface of the spiny pollen, which otherwise looks like yellow dust to the naked eye.\n\n\"We observed this native pollen from the Rockies has optimally spaced spines that allow it to easily attach to a pollinator, such as a bumblebee,\" said Austin Lynn, a recent graduate with a doctorate in biology from the Division of Biological Sciences in the College of Arts and Science. \"When we compared that with the average lawn dandelion, which does not need pollen to reproduce, we saw that the pollen on the lawn dandelion has a shorter distance between these spines, making it harder to attach to traveling pollinators. Therefore, we show this wild dandelion pollen has evolved over many generations to create an optimal shape for attaching to pollinators.\"\n\nPrevious studies have examined spiny pollen, but this is one of the first studies focusing on the pollen's spines. Lynn, the lead researcher on the study, said the researchers were also able to refute a competing idea that spiny pollen serves as a defensive mechanism to protect the pollen from being eaten.\n\n\"The spiny pollen actually acts like Velcro,\" Lynn said. \"So, when bees are harvesting pollen for food, this pollen is sticking to their hair. It's a great example of mutualism where the plant needs the pollinator to reproduce and the pollinator needs the plant for its food.\"\n\nThe researchers plan to study how a bumblebee's hairs contribute to this process.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520124958.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T17:49:58", "title": "Replacing time spent sitting with sleep or light activity may improve your mood", "text": "Moving more and sitting less was a challenge for many of us, even before states started issuing stay-at-home orders. Despite disruptions to our daily work and exercise routines, there are some subtle changes we can make at home to help improve our mental health.\n\nNew research, published by the American Journal of Preventive Medicine, found that substituting prolonged sedentary time with sleep was associated with lower stress, better mood and lower body mass index (BMI), and substituting light physical activity was associated with improved mood and lower BMI across the next year. Jacob Meyer, lead author and assistant professor of kinesiology at Iowa State University, says light activity can include walking around your home office while talking on the phone or standing while preparing dinner.\n\n\"People may not even think about some of these activities as physical activity,\" Meyer said. \"Light activity is much lower intensity than going to the gym or walking to work, but taking these steps to break up long periods of sitting may have an impact.\"\n\nMeyer and colleagues used data collected as part of the Energy Balance Study at the University of South Carolina. For 10 days, study participants, ranging in age from 21 to 35, wore an armband that tracked their energy expenditure. Meyer, director of the Wellbeing and Exercise Lab at Iowa State, says the data allowed researchers to objectively measure sleep, physical activity and sedentary time, rather than relying on self-reports.\n\nIn addition to the benefits of sleep and light physical activity, the researchers found moderate to vigorous activity was associated with lower body fat and BMI. Given the negative health effects of prolonged sedentary time, Meyer says the findings may encourage people to make small changes that are sustainable.\n\n\"It may be easier for people to change their behavior if they feel it's doable and doesn't require a major change,\" Meyer said. \"Replacing sedentary time with housework or other light activities is something they may be able to do more consistently than going for an hour-long run.\"\n\nGetting more sleep is another relatively simple change to make. Instead of staying up late watching TV, going to bed earlier and getting up at a consistent time provides multiple benefits and allows your body to recover, Meyer said. Sleeping is also unique in that it is time you're not engaging in other potentially problematic behaviors, such as eating junk food while sitting in front of a screen.\n\nSomething we can control\n\nMaking these subtle changes was associated with better current mood, but light physical activity also provided benefits for up to a year, the study found. While the research was conducted prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, Meyer says the results are timely given the growing mental health concerns during this time of physical distancing.\n\n\"With everything happening right now, this is one thing we can control or manage and it has the potential to help our mental health,\" Meyer said.\n\nAs states start to ease stay-at-home restrictions, Meyer is looking at changes in physical activity and sitting time with potentially interesting results for those who regularly worked out prior to the pandemic.

This can happen during rains when a storm's updraft carries the grains to the cloud base, where humidity is quite high. The fragments then are shot back toward the surface by falling rain and the storm's downdraft.\n\nThe main difference between pollen and pollen fragments is, predictably, their size: Intact pollen grains are larger, at 20 to 100 microns, and settle to the ground. Pollen fragments, at less than 2.5 microns in size, do not settle readily and often remain aloft.\n\nStone and her team decided to test the results of previous research by directly measuring pollen from rain events in Iowa City, Iowa, between April 17 and May 31, 2019. This period of time, in prime tree pollen season, included light rains, thunderstorms, and even a severe weather event punctuated by a storm that spawned a tornado. In all, the researchers recorded rain on 28 days.\n\n\"Our study shows clearly that rain decreases intact pollen concentrations. But it can also increase pollen fragments,\" says Stone, who's also affiliated with the Department of Chemical and Biochemical Engineering at Iowa. \"The interesting thing about the pollen fragments is the really high concentrations only last for a short period of time, primarily when it's raining and during the peak of the storm.\"\n\nThe researchers say pollen fragment concentrations remain elevated from 2.5 to 11 hours after a rain, the longer times associated with the heaviest rains.\n\nStone and her team measured the highest concentration of pollen fragments during a morning storm on May 18, with a peak concentration at 1.3 million pollen fragments per cubic meter of air.

No perceptible difference was found: the variety of tomato is much more important.

But a new discovery made with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) of a massive rotating disk galaxy, seen when the universe was only ten percent of its current age, challenges the traditional models of galaxy formation. This research appears on 20 May 2020 in the journal Nature.\n\nGalaxy DLA0817g, nicknamed the Wolfe Disk after the late astronomer Arthur M. Wolfe, is the most distant rotating disk galaxy ever observed. The unparalleled power of ALMA made it possible to see this galaxy spinning at 170 miles (272 kilometers) per second, similar to our Milky Way.\n\n\"While previous studies hinted at the existence of these early rotating gas-rich disk galaxies, thanks to ALMA we now have unambiguous evidence that they occur as early as 1.5 billion years after the Big Bang,\" said lead author Marcel Neeleman of the Max Planck Institute for Astronomy in Heidelberg, Germany.\n\nHow did the Wolfe Disk form?\n\nThe discovery of the Wolfe Disk provides a challenge for many galaxy formation simulations, which predict that massive galaxies at this point in the evolution of the cosmos grew through many mergers of smaller galaxies and hot clumps of gas.\n\n\"Most galaxies that we find early in the universe look like train wrecks because they underwent consistent and often 'violent' merging,\" explained Neeleman. \"These hot mergers make it difficult to form well-ordered, cold rotating disks like we observe in our present universe.\"\n\nIn most galaxy formation scenarios, galaxies only start to show a well-formed disk around 6 billion years after the Big Bang. The fact that the astronomers found such a disk galaxy when the universe was only ten percent of its current age, indicates that other growth processes must have dominated.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We think the Wolfe Disk has grown primarily through the steady accretion of cold gas,\" said J. Xavier Prochaska, of the University of California, Santa Cruz and coauthor of the paper. \"Still, one of the questions that remains is how to assemble such a large gas mass while maintaining a relatively stable, rotating disk.\"\n\nStar formation\n\nThe team also used the National Science Foundation's Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) and the NASA/ESA Hubble Space Telescope to learn more about star formation in the Wolfe Disk. In radio wavelengths, ALMA looked at the galaxy's movements and mass of atomic gas and dust while the VLA measured the amount of molecular mass -- the fuel for star formation. In UV-light, Hubble observed massive stars. \"The star formation rate in the Wolfe Disk is at least ten times higher than in our own galaxy,\" explained Prochaska. \"It must be one of the most productive disk galaxies in the early universe.\"\n\nA 'normal' galaxy\n\nThe Wolfe Disk was first discovered by ALMA in 2017. Neeleman and his team found the galaxy when they examined the light from a more distant quasar. The light from the quasar was absorbed as it passed through a massive reservoir of hydrogen gas surrounding the galaxy -- which is how it revealed itself. Rather than looking for direct light from extremely bright, but more rare galaxies, astronomers used this 'absorption' method to find fainter, and more 'normal' galaxies in the early universe.\n\n\"The fact that we found the Wolfe Disk using this method, tells us that it belongs to the normal population of galaxies present at early times,\" said Neeleman. \"When our newest observations with ALMA surprisingly showed that it is rotating, we realized that early rotating disk galaxies are not as rare as we thought and that there should be a lot more of them out there.\"\n\n\"This observation epitomizes how our understanding of the universe is enhanced with the advanced sensitivity that ALMA brings to radio astronomy,\" said Joe Pesce, astronomy program director at the National Science Foundation, which funds the telescope. \"ALMA allows us to make new, unexpected findings with almost every observation.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520120735.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T17:07:35", "title": "Caves tell us that Australia's mountains are still growing: Buchan Caves unlock technique for measuring uplift of mountains", "text": "Australia has often been unfairly portrayed as an old and idle continent with little geological activity, but new research suggests that we remain geologically active and that some of our mountains are still growing.\n\nThe University of Melbourne study reveals that parts of the Eastern Highlands of Victoria, including popular skiing destinations such as Mt Baw Baw and Mt Buller, may be as young as five million years, not 90 million years as originally thought.\n\nJohn Engel is one of four scientists from the Isotope Geochemistry Group in the School of Earth Sciences who studied the stalagmites, stalactites, and flowstones -- technically called 'speleothems' -- in the nearby Buchan Caves to produce the findings.\n\n\"At least 250 meters of additional height in the East Victorian Highlands appears to have been gained in the last few million years,\" Mr Engel said.\n\nWith the help of Parks Victoria Rangers, the team visited 10 caves, climbing down through the passages and crawling through tight squeezes to collect small fragments of speleothem 'rubble' to take back to the lab to determine their age, using radiometric U-Pb dating.\n\n\"Our research shows a clear trend between oldest speleothem (cave age) and height in the landscape,\" Mr Engel said. \"The data suggests that the Buchan region has been steadily uplifting at a rate of 76 meters every million years, beginning at least 3.5 million years ago and continuing today.

Some of this tectonically-induced stress is then released as uplift of the mountains in South East Australia,\" Mr Engel said.\n\n\"This is why East Gippsland may still feel effects related to these tectonic forces.

According to new supercomputer model simulations, only competition between Neanderthals and Homo sapiens can explain the rapid demise of Neanderthals around 43 to 38 thousand years ago.\n\nNeanderthals lived in Eurasia for at least 300,000 years. Then, around 43 to 38 thousand years ago they quickly disappeared off the face of the earth, leaving only weak genetic traces in present-day Homo sapiens populations. It is well established that their extinction coincided with a period of rapidly fluctuating climatic conditions, as well as with the arrival of Homo sapiens in Europe. However, determining which of these factors was the dominant cause, has remained one of the biggest challenges of evolutionary anthropology.\n\nTo quantify which processes played a major role in the collapse of Neanderthal populations one needs to use mathematical models that can realistically simulate the migration of Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, their interactions, competition and interbreeding in a changing climatic environment. Such models did not exist previously.\n\nIn a new paper published in the journal Quaternary Science Review, Axel Timmermann, Director of the IBS Center for Climate Physics at Pusan National University, presents the first realistic computer model simulation of the extinction of Neanderthals across Eurasia. The model which is comprised of several thousands of lines of computer code and is run on the IBS supercomputer Aleph, solves a series of mathematical equations that describe how Neanderthals and Homo sapiens moved in a time-varying glacial landscape and under shifting temperature, rainfall and vegetation patterns. In the model both hominin groups compete for the same food resources and a small fraction is allowed to interbreed. The key parameters of the model are obtained from realistic climate computer model simulations, genetic and demographic data.\n\n\"This is the first time we can quantify the drivers of Neanderthal extinction,\" said Timmermann. \"In the computer model I can turn on and off different processes, such as abrupt climate change, interbreeding or competition\" he said. By comparing the results with existing paleo-anthropological, genetic and archeological data, Timmermann demonstrated that a realistic extinction in the computer model is only possible, if Homo sapiens had significant advantages over Neanderthals in terms of exploiting existing food resources. Even though the model does not specify the details, possible reasons for the superiority of Homo sapiens could have been associated with better hunting techniques, stronger resistance to pathogens or higher level of fecundity.\n\nWhat exactly caused the rapid Neanderthal demise has remained elusive for a long time. This new computer modeling approach identifies competitive exclusion as the likely reason for the disappearance of our cousins. \"Neanderthals lived in Eurasia for the last 300,000 years and experienced and adapted to abrupt climate shifts, that were even more dramatic than those that occurred during the time of Neanderthal disappearance. It is not a coincidence that Neanderthals vanished just at the time, when Homo sapiens started to spread into Europe\" says Timmermann. He adds \"The new computer model simulations show clearly that this event was the first major extinction caused by our own species.\"\n\nA research team at the IBS Center for Climate Physics is now improving the computer model to also include megafauna and implement more realistic climate forcings. \"This is a new field of research in which climate scientists can interact with mathematicians, geneticists, archeologists and anthropologists,\" said Axel Timmermann.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520120730.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T17:07:30", "title": "Simple question can lead to remedy for older adults' dizziness and impaired balance", "text": "Does lying down or turning over in bed make you feel dizzy?

Many suffer in silence from dizziness and impaired balance, which have a major impact on their quality of life. Although these symptoms are not life-threatening, those affected are at an elevated risk of feeling unsteady and accidentally falling when they walk.\n\nThe purpose of a new thesis presented at Sahlgrenska Academy has been to boost knowledge of older people's dizziness and unsteady gait, focusing on BPPV. The author, Ellen Lindell, is a specialist ear, nose and throat (ENT) doctor at S\u00f6dra \u00c4lvsborg Hospital in Bor\u00e5s, where some of the research was carried out.\n\nOne of the studies described in the thesis comprised 149 patients -- 96 women and 53 men -- referred for ENT treatment because of dizziness. In conjunction with being examined, each patient filled in a questionnaire composed of 15 questions. The question most clearly connected with the diagnosis of BPPV was the one about whether the patient felt dizzy on turning over in bed.\n\n\"Onset of vertigo when a person lies down or turns over in bed is a quick identifier of BPPV, the most common cause of dizziness, which is potentially curable. Treating it enhances patients' wellbeing and can reduce many older people's suffering and cut costs to society,\" Lindell says.\n\nBPPV, the most frequent cause of vertigo arising from the balance organs of the inner ear. It is due to otoliths (crystals) from the inner ear loosening and being displaced. The symptoms are dizziness resulting mainly from a change of position. Many people with BPPV also experience unsteadiness when they stand and walk.\n\nThe remedy for BPPV is maneuver treatments, often performed by a physical therapist, with the aim of restoring the otoliths to their proper place. The technique involves turning and spinning the patient's whole body, and it varies according to which semicircular canal, on which side of the body, is affected.\n\nThree of ten people aged 70 and over are estimated as suffering from dizziness and impaired balance. According to the thesis, which is also based on data from the extensive Gothenburg H70 population-based study of aging and health, vertigo at age 75 is more common in women than men, but by age 79 this gender difference has disappeared.\n\nAmong the 79-year-olds examined, more than half had dizziness and four of ten had suffered accidental falls in the past year. People with dizziness take more medications, are more tired, walk more slowly, are more afraid of falling and have worse self-rated health than people without it.\n\n\"The results in my thesis show that for those who are affected by dizziness, it's associated with experiencing inferior health-related quality of life, and their subjective health self-assessments are less favorable than people without dizziness,\" Lindell says.\n\nTitle: Dizziness and Benign Paroxysmal Positional Vertigo among older adults -- health-related quality of life and associated factors; http://hdl.handle.net/2077/62213", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520084135.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T13:41:35", "title": "Climate change will turn coastal Antarctica green, say scientists", "text": "Scientists have created the first ever large-scale map of microscopic algae as they bloomed across the surface of snow along the Antarctic Peninsula coast. Results indicate that this 'green snow' is likely to spread as global temperatures increase.\n\nThe team, involving researchers from the University of Cambridge and the British Antarctic Survey, combined satellite data with on-the-ground observations over two summers in Antarctica to detect and measure the green snow algae. Although each individual alga is microscopic in size, when they grow en masse they turn the snow bright green and can be seen from space. The study is published today in the journal Nature Communications.\n\n\"This is a significant advance in our understanding of land-based life on Antarctica, and how it might change in the coming years as the climate warms,\" said Dr Matt Davey in the University of Cambridge's Department of Plant Sciences, who led the study. \"Snow algae are a key component of the continent's ability to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere through photosynthesis.\"\n\nBlooms of green snow algae are found around the Antarctic coastline, particularly on islands along the west coast of the Antarctic Peninsula. They grow in 'warmer' areas, where average temperatures are just above zero degrees Celsius during the austral summer -- the Southern Hemisphere's summer months of November to February. The Peninsula is the part of Antarctica that experienced the most rapid warming in the latter part of the last century.\n\nThe team found that the distribution of green snow algae is also strongly influenced by marine birds and mammals, whose excrement acts as a highly nutritious natural fertiliser to accelerate algal growth. Over 60% of blooms were found within five kilometres of a penguin colony. Algae were also observed growing near the nesting sites of other birds, including skuas, and areas where seals come ashore.\n\nThe team used images from the European Space Agency's Sentinel 2 satellite taken between 2017 and 2019, and combined these with measurements they made on the ground in Antarctica at Ryder Bay, Adelaide Island, and the Fildes Peninsula, King George Island.\n\n\"We identified 1679 separate blooms of green algae on the snow surface, which together covered an area of 1.9 km2, equating to a carbon sink of around 479 tonnes per year\" said Davey. Put into context this is the same amount of carbon emitted by about 875,000 average petrol car journeys in the UK.\n\nAlmost two thirds of the green algal blooms were on small, low-lying islands with no high ground. As the Antarctic Peninsula warms due to rising global temperatures, these islands may lose their summer snow cover and with it their snow algae. However, in terms of mass, the majority of snow algae is found in a small number of larger blooms in the north of the Peninsula and the South Shetland Islands, in areas where they can spread to higher ground as low-lying snow melts.\n\n\"As Antarctica warms, we predict the overall mass of snow algae will increase, as the spread to higher ground will significantly outweigh the loss of small island patches of algae,\" said Dr Andrew Gray, lead author of the paper, and a researcher at the University of Cambridge and NERC Field Spectroscopy Facility, Edinburgh.\n\nPhotosynthesis is the process in which plants and algae generate their own energy, using sunlight to capture carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and release oxygen. There are many different types of algae, from the tiny, single-celled species measured in this study, to large leafy species like giant kelp. The majority of algae live in watery environments, and when excess nitrogen and phosphorus are available they can multiply rapidly to create visible algal blooms.\n\nThe researchers say that the total amount of carbon held in Antarctic snow algae is likely to be much larger because carbon dioxide is also taken up by other red and orange algae, which could not be measured in this study. They plan further work to measure these other algal blooms, and also to measure the blooms across the whole of Antarctica using a mixture of field work and satellite images.\n\nAntarctica is the world's southernmost continent, typically known as a frozen land of snow and ice. But terrestrial life can be abundant, particularly along its coastline, and is responding rapidly to climate changes in the region.

But drugs can sometimes leak out of liposomes before they reach their destination, reducing the dose received by the tumor and causing side effects in healthy tissues. Now, researchers report in ACS' Nano Letters a way to stabilize liposomes by embedding a stiff nanobowl in their inner cavity.\n\nScientists have tried various approaches to prevent liposomes from leaking, such as coating their surfaces with polymers or crosslinking lipids in their bilayers. However, these modifications can alter the properties of liposomes so that they interact differently with cells. Chao Fang, Jonathan Lovell and colleagues wanted to find a new way to stabilize liposomes that keeps their surfaces intact. They decided to try nanobowls -- concave nanostructures with an opening that would allow drugs to escape once the liposomal bilayers break up inside a cancer cell. They reasoned that by assembling the lipid bilayer around the nanobowl, the rigid structure would mechanically support the liposome.\n\nThe team prepared silica nanobowls, modifying their surfaces with a positively charged chemical group and assembling a negatively charged lipid bilayer around each structure. Then, they loaded the chemotherapy drug doxorubicin into the water-filled center. The resulting nanobowl-stabilized liposomes were less leaky than regular liposomes in serum or under sheer stress, as would be encountered in blood vessels, but still released doxorubicin when taken up by cancer cells in a dish. In an experiment with mice that had transplanted, metastatic breast tumors, animals injected with the nanobowl-liposomes lived longer than those receiving regular liposomes. The nanobowl-treated mice also had smaller tumors compared with the group receiving conventional liposomes, and the cancer had not spread to their lungs, in contrast to the other group.

Astronomers know planets are born in dusty discs surrounding young stars, like AB Aurigae, as cold gas and dust clump together. The new observations with ESO's VLT , published in Astronomy & Astrophysics, provide crucial clues to help scientists better understand this process.\n\n\"We need to observe very young systems to really capture the moment when planets form,\" says Boccaletti. But until now astronomers had been unable to take sufficiently sharp and deep images of these young discs to find the 'twist' that marks the spot where a baby planet may be coming to existence.\n\nThe new images feature a stunning spiral of dust and gas around AB Aurigae, located 520 light-years away from Earth in the constellation of Auriga (The Charioteer).

As the planet rotates around the central star, this wave gets shaped into a spiral arm. The very bright yellow 'twist' region close to the centre of the new AB Aurigae image, which lies at about the same distance from the star as Neptune from the Sun, is one of these disturbance sites where the team believe a planet is being made.\n\nObservations of the AB Aurigae system made a few years ago with the Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA, in which ESO is a partner, provided the first hints of ongoing planet formation around the star. In the ALMA images, scientists spotted two spiral arms of gas close to the star, lying within the disc's inner region. Then, in 2019 and early 2020, Boccaletti and a team of astronomers from France, Taiwan, the US and Belgium set out to capture a clearer picture by turning the SPHERE instrument on ESO's VLT in Chile toward the star. The SPHERE images are the deepest images of the AB Aurigae system obtained to date.\n\nWith SPHERE's powerful imaging system, astronomers could see the fainter light from small dust grains and emissions coming from the inner disc. They confirmed the presence of the spiral arms first detected by ALMA and also spotted another remarkable feature, a 'twist', that points to the presence of ongoing planet formation in the disc. \"The twist is expected from some theoretical models of planet formation,\" says co-author Anne Dutrey, also at LAB. \"It corresponds to the connection of two spirals -- one winding inwards of the planet's orbit, the other expanding outwards -- which join at the planet location. They allow gas and dust from the disc to accrete onto the forming planet and make it grow.\"\n\nESO is constructing the 39-metre Extremely Large Telescope, which will draw on the cutting-edge work of ALMA and SPHERE to study extrasolar worlds. As Boccaletti explains, this powerful telescope will allow astronomers to get even more detailed views of planets in the making. \"We should be able to see directly and more precisely how the dynamics of the gas contributes to the formation of planets,\" he concludes.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200520084125.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T13:41:25", "title": "Every heart dances to a different tune", "text": "Play the same piece of music to two people, and their hearts can respond very differently. That's the conclusion of a novel study presented today on EHRA Essentials 4 You, a scientific platform of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC).\n\nThis pioneering research revealed how music triggers individual effects on the heart, a vital first step to developing personalised music prescriptions for common ailments or to help people stay alert or relaxed.\n\n\"We used precise methods to record the heart's response to music and found that what is calming for one person can be arousing for another,\" said Professor Elaine Chew of the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS).1\n\nPrevious studies investigating physiological responses to music have measured changes in heart rate after listening to different recordings simply categorised as 'sad', 'happy', 'calm', or 'violent'.\n\nThis small study took a more precise approach, featuring several unique aspects. Three patients with mild heart failure requiring a pacemaker were invited to a live classical piano concert. Because they all wore a pacemaker, their heart rate could be kept constant during the performance. The researchers measured the electrical activity of the heart directly from the pacemaker leads before and after 24 points in the score (and performance) where there were stark changes in tempo, volume, or rhythm.\n\nSpecifically, they measured the time it takes the heart to recover after a heartbeat. \"Heart rate affects this recovery time, so by keeping that constant we could assess electrical changes in the heart based on emotional response to the music,\" said Professor Chew.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We are interested in the heart's recovery time (rather than heart rate) because it is linked to the heart's electrical stability and susceptibility to dangerous heart rhythm disorders,\" explained the project's medical lead Professor Pier Lambiase of University College London. \"In some people, life-threatening heart rhythm disorders can be triggered by stress. Using music we can study, in a low risk way, how stress (or mild tension induced by music) alters this recovery period.\"\n\nThe researchers found that change in the heart's recovery time was significantly different from person to person at the same junctures in the music. Recovery time reduced by as much as 5 milliseconds, indicating increased stress or arousal. And recovery time lengthened by as much as 5 milliseconds, meaning greater relaxation.\n\nCommenting on the individual nature of reactions, Professor Chew said: \"Even though two people might have statistically significant changes across the same musical transition, their responses could go in opposite directions. So for one person the musical transition is relaxing, while for another it is arousing or stress inducing.\"\n\nFor example: a person not expecting a transition from soft to loud music could find it stressful, leading to a shortened heart recovery time. For another person it could be the resolution to a long build-up in the music and hence a release, resulting in a lengthened heart recovery time.\n\nProfessor Chew said: \"By understanding how an individual's heart reacts to musical changes, we plan to design tailored music interventions to elicit the desired response.\"\n\n\"This could be to reduce blood pressure or lower the risk of heart rhythm disorders without the side effects of medication,\" added Professor Lambiase.\n\nProfessor Chew noted that while the number of patients in the study is small, the researchers amassed gigabytes of data.

But what happens during exercise to trigger these benefits? New UT Southwestern research that mapped brain changes after one year of aerobic workouts has uncovered a potentially critical process: Exercise boosts blood flow into two key regions of the brain associated with memory. Notably, the study showed this blood flow can help even older people with memory issues improve cognition, a finding that scientists say could guide future Alzheimer's disease research.\n\n\"Perhaps we can one day develop a drug or procedure that safely targets blood flow into these brain regions,\" says Binu Thomas, Ph.D., a UT Southwestern senior research scientist in neuroimaging. \"But we're just getting started with exploring the right combination of strategies to help prevent or delay symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. There's much more to understand about the brain and aging.\"\n\nBlood flow and memory\n\nThe study, published in the Journal of Alzheimer's Disease, documented changes in long-term memory and cerebral blood flow in 30 participants, each of them 60 or older with memory problems. Half of them underwent 12 months of aerobic exercise training; the rest did only stretching.\n\nThe exercise group showed 47 percent improvement in memory scores after one year compared with minimal change in the stretch participants. Brain imaging of the exercise group, taken while they were at rest at the beginning and end of the study, showed increased blood flow into the anterior cingulate cortex and the hippocampus -- neural regions that play important roles in memory function.\n\nOther studies have documented benefits for cognitively normal adults on an exercise program, including previous research from Thomas that showed aging athletes have better blood flow into the cortex than sedentary older adults. But the new research is significant because it plots improvement over a longer period in adults at high risk to develop Alzheimer's disease.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We've shown that even when your memory starts to fade, you can still do something about it by adding aerobic exercise to your lifestyle,\" Thomas says.\n\nMounting evidence\n\nThe search for dementia interventions is becoming increasingly pressing: More than 5 million Americans have Alzheimer's disease, and the number is expected to triple by 2050.\n\nRecent research has helped scientists gain a greater understanding of the molecular genesis of the disease, including a 2018 discovery from UT Southwestern's Peter O'Donnell Jr. Brain Institute that is guiding efforts to detect the condition before symptoms arise. Yet the billions of dollars spent on researching how to prevent or slow dementia have yielded no proven treatments that would make an early diagnosis actionable for patients.\n\nUT Southwestern scientists are among many teams across the world trying to determine if exercise may be the first such intervention. Evidence is mounting that it could at least play a small role in delaying or reducing the risk of Alzheimer's disease.\n\nFor example, a 2018 study showed that people with lower fitness levels experienced faster deterioration of vital nerve fibers in the brain called white matter. A study published last year showed exercise correlated with slower deterioration of the hippocampus.\n\nRegarding the importance of blood flow, Thomas says it may someday be used in combination with other strategies to preserve brain function in people with mild cognitive impairment.\n\n\"Cerebral blood flow is a part of the puzzle, and we need to continue piecing it together,\" Thomas says. \"But we've seen enough data to know that starting a fitness program can have lifelong benefits for our brains as well as our hearts.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519204121.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T01:41:21", "title": "Ancient giant armored fish fed in a similar way to basking sharks", "text": "Scientists from the University of Bristol and the University of Zurich have shown that the Titanichthys -- a giant armoured fish that lived in the seas and oceans of the late Devonian period 380-million-years ago -- fed in a similar manner to modern day basking sharks.\n\nTitanichthys has long been known as one of the largest animals of the Devonian -- its exact size is difficult to determine, but it likely exceeded five metres in length; like in the basking shark, its lower jaw reached lengths exceeding one metre. However, unlike its similarly giant contemporary Dunkleosteus, there is no previous evidence of how Titanichthys fed.\n\nWhere the lower jaw of Dunkleosteus and many of its relatives had clear fangs and crushing plates, the lower jaw of Titanichthys is narrow and lacking any dentition or sharp edges suitable for cutting.\n\nConsequently, Titanichthys has been presumed to have been a suspension-feeder, feeding on minute plankton by swimming slowly with the mouth opened widely through water to capture high concentrations of plankton -- a technique called continuous ram feeding.\n\nHowever, this has remained uncertain, as no fossilised evidence of suspension-feeding structures such as elongate projections that cover the gills in modern suspension-feeding fish has ever been found.\n\nInstead, the team sought to investigate the question indirectly, using biomechanical analysis to compare the lower jaw of Titanichthys with those of other species. Their findings are reported today in the journal Royal Society Open Science.\n\nadvertisement\n\nLead author Sam Coatham carried out the research while studying for his masters in palaeobiology at the University of Bristol's School of Earth Sciences.\n\nHe said: \"We have found that Titanichthys was very likely to have been a suspension-feeder, showing that its lower jaw was considerably less mechanically robust than those of other placoderm species that fed on large or hard-shelled prey.\n\n\"Consequently, those feeding strategies (common amongst its relatives) would probably have not been available for Titanichthys.\"\n\nThe fossils of Titanichthys used in the study were found in the Moroccan part of the Sahara Desert by co-author Christian Klug, a researcher at the University of Zurich. He added: \"When you do field work in the Anti-Atlas, massive skull bones of placoderms can be found quite frequently.\"\n\nThe team tested the resilience of the jaws by virtually applying forces to the jaws, using a technique called Finite Element Analysis (FEA) to assess how likely each jaw was to break or bend.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThis revealed that the lower jaw of Titanichthys was much less resistant to stress and was more likely to break than those of the other placoderm species, such as the famous Dunkleosteus. Therefore, the jaw of Titanichthys probably would not have been able to withstand the higher stresses associated with their strategies of feeding on large prey, which thus exert more mechanical stress on the jaws.\n\nThis pattern was consistent in both sharks and whales, with the suspension-feeder proving less resistant to stress than the other species within the same lineage. Further analyses comparing the distribution of stress across the jaws showed similar patterns in Titanichthys and the basking shark, reinforcing this comparison.\n\nIt has been established that there were almost certainly giant suspension-feeding vertebrates living 380 million years ago, at least 150 million years before the suspension-feeding Pachycormidae (previously the earliest definitive example) and about 350 million years before the first baleen whales.\n\nThe research team believes that there are other extinct species that would have filled a similar ecological role, including other placoderms (armoured fish) and at least one species of plesiosaur.\n\nSam Coatham added: \"Our methods could be extended to identify other such species in the fossil record and investigate whether there were common factors driving the evolution and extinction of these species.\n\n\"We suggest a link between oceanic productivity and the evolution of Titanichthys, but this should be investigated in detail in the future.

In the most comprehensive study of its kind, 30 researchers from 11 countries studied 15 skin samples from whales feeding around the sub-Antarctic island of South Georgia and compared them to 149 samples collected from around Argentina and Brazil and South Africa where the whales breed and give birth to their calves. New samples were collected from South Georgia during an expedition led by the British Antarctic Survey in 2018 and were combined with samples held by a network of collaborators across the globe.\n\nUsing a new genetic tool, the team discovered that most of the animals visiting South Georgia were calved around South America and not South Africa. This had previously been suspected, but not confirmed.\n\nLead author Dr Emma Carroll, from University of Auckland says: \"Genetic methods are important in linking whale breeding grounds, areas that are closely monitored for population recovery, with feeding areas that are being and will be impacted by climate change. It is only by understanding these links that we can understand how whale populations will fare in a changing world.\"\n\nCollaborating with Chilean colleagues, the team also analysed the first ever DNA sample from the Critically Endangered Chile-Peru southern right whale population.

Space, security, light -- or a combination of these? Like humans, animals make choices about where to live that have important implications for their livelihoods. But unlike humans, animals do not easily reveal the basis of their choice.\n\nNow, researchers from the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior in Konstanz and the University of Konstanz have created a paradigm that can disentangle the strands of animal decision-making. By using CT scanning, 3D modelling and 3D printing, they have created artificial shelters that vary in precise ways, and used these structures to reveal the underlying preferences of animals.\n\nThe findings are reported in Proceedings of the Royal Society B in a paper by Humboldt post-doctoral fellow, Dr. Aneesh Bose; bachelor students of the University of Konstanz, Johannes Windorfer and Alex Boehm; and Dr Alex Jordan, Principal Investigator in the Max Planck Institute of Animal Behavior and the DFG Cluster of Excellence \"Centre for the Advanced Study of Collective Behaviour\" at the University of Konstanz. The study also included co-authors from the University of Basel.\n\nStudying shelter selection\n\nAneesh Bose, a postdoc in Jordan's lab and co-first author of the study points out that the choices an animal makes, especially when it comes to choosing a home, can have major implications for the choosing animal. \"A shelter can serve many ecological roles, a place to rear babies, hide from predators, perform social behaviour,\" says Bose. \"But just looking at the choices animals make doesn't give us a correct answer of what they want because they are constrained by what's available to them.\"\n\nThe problem with studying shelter selection in the wild is that many traits in nature are linked. A bigger shelter (for example a burrow, den, hole, or shell), could be better for rearing off-spring, while a bigger shelter entrance opens the way for more predators to enter. However, bigger shelters often have bigger entranceways, and many animals are unable to physically alter the structures they encounter and choose amongst in the wild. Therefore, pinpointing the function behind an animal's preferences for shelter structures requires circumventing the constraints of the natural world where traits are often correlated.\n\nadvertisement\n\n3D models of shells\n\nThe researchers devised an experimental framework that enabled methodical appraisal of the possible traits of importance. Selecting a species of shell-dwelling cichlid fish (Neolamprologus multifasciatus) from Lake Tanganyika, Africa, they used high resolution CT scanning on a range of the snail shells that the fish use as shelters. From the scans, 3D models of the structures were created wherein certain features of the shells were manipulated independently of each other. The models were 3D printed to create accurate shell replicas and then offered to fish in choice experiments.\n\nFish showed preferences for exaggerated shells that bore dimensions that do not exist, or rarely exist, in nature. Fish preferred shells that were fully intact and either enlarged, lengthened, or had widened apertures. Notably, fish were able to distinguish chirality -- the direction of coiling -- in the shells provided, always favouring shells with the same chirality as those that exist in their natural habitat. The important finding was that, for fish, not every home structural feature is equal. In fact, they preferred shell intactness more than shell length, which was itself preferred more heavily than entrance size. These are facets of the fish's decision-making process that could not be ascertained without such a controlled, manipulative experiment.\n\nUnderstanding animal behaviour\n\n\"The innovation of our study is that we have been able to 3D print a biological structure with precisely controlled dimensions, rather than using samples of real shells, which are limited in how they can be manipulated,\" says Windorfer, a bachelor student and co-lead author on the study. \"And that way we escape the confines of the natural world.\"\n\nJordan, senior author on the study says: \"Our ultimate goal is to understand why animals choose the things they do, so first we have be certain we know what they choose. For example, I choose my beer based on taste, and I don't really care about the bottle it comes in. But someone watching me might notice that all my favourite beers come in green bottles, and conclude I prefer green bottles.\"\n\n\"If we are to avoid making the same mistake in animal behaviour, we need to figure out a different way. Our study shows how you can experimentally dissociate linked traits and gives us a very powerful experimental framework to explore the ultimate basis of animal decision-making.\"\n\nBackground information", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519190206.htm", "published": "2020-05-20T00:02:06", "title": "Walking or cycling to work associated with reduced risk of early death and illness", "text": "People who walk, cycle and travel by train to work are at reduced risk of early death or illness compared with those who commute by car.\n\nThese are the findings of a study of over 300,000 commuters in England and Wales, by researchers from Imperial College London and the University of Cambridge.\n\nThe researchers say the findings suggest increased walking and cycling post-lockdown may reduce deaths from heart disease and cancer.\n\nThe study, published in The Lancet Planetary Health, used Census data to track the same people for up to 25 years, between 1991-2016.\n\nIt found that, compared with those who drove, those who cycled to work had a 20 per cent reduced rate of early death, 24 per cent reduced rate of death from cardiovascular disease (which includes heart attack and stroke) during the study period, a 16 per cent reduced rate of death from cancer, and an 11 per cent reduced rate of a cancer diagnosis.\n\nWalking to work was associated with a 7 per cent reduced rate in cancer diagnosis, compared to driving. The team explain that associations between walking and other outcomes, such as rates of death from cancer and heart disease, were less certain. One potential reason for this is people who walk to work are, on average, in less affluent occupations than people who drive to work, and more likely to have underlying health conditions which could not be fully accounted for.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe paper also revealed that compared with those who drove to work, rail commuters had a 10 per cent reduced rate of early death, a 20 per cent reduced rate of death from cardiovascular disease, and a 12 per cent reduced rate of cancer diagnosis. This is likely due to them walking or cycling to transit points, although rail commuters also tend to be more affluent and less likely to have other underlying conditions, say the team.\n\nDr Richard Patterson from the MRC Epidemiology Unit at the University of Cambridge who led the research said: \"As large numbers of people begin to return to work as the COVID-19 lockdown eases, it is a good time for everyone to rethink their transport choices. With severe and prolonged limits in public transport capacity likely, switching to private car use would be disastrous for our health and the environment. Encouraging more people to walk and cycle will help limit the longer-term consequences of the pandemic.\"\n\nThe study also assessed whether the benefits of each mode of travel differed between occupational groups and found that potential health benefits were similar across these groups.\n\nThe team used data from the UK Office for National Statistics Longitudinal Study of England and Wales, a dataset that links data from several sources including the Census of England and Wales, and registrations of death and cancer diagnoses.\n\nThe data revealed overall 66 per cent of people drove to work, 19 per cent used public transport, 12 per cent walked, and 3 per cent cycled. Men were more likely than women to drive or cycle to work, but were less likely to use public transport or walk.\n\nDr Anthony Laverty, senior author from the School of Public Health at Imperial College London explained: \"It's great to see that the government is providing additional investment to encourage more walking and cycling during the post-lockdown period. While not everyone is able to walk or cycle to work, the government can support people to ensure that beneficial shifts in travel behaviour are sustained in the longer term. Additional benefits include better air quality which has improved during lockdown and reduced carbon emissions which is crucial to address the climate emergency.\"\n\nThe team add that the benefits of cycling and walking are well-documented, but use of Census data in this new study allowed large numbers of people to be followed up for a longer time. They explain that these analyses were unable to account for differences in participants' dietary intakes, smoking, other physical activity or underlying health conditions.

Their work was recently published in Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS).\n\nThis groundbreaking research was achieved by combining RNA sequence analysis of patient liver samples with transgenic mouse studies.\n\nThe team identified two promising potential molecular targets for ALD drug development -- cGAS and Cx32.

That process also fuels a strong secondary inflammatory response that affects nearby cells and can eventually lead to liver failure.\n\nBut scientists have been puzzling over how alcohol activates IRF3 and which pathways amplify the inflammatory signals that make the disease spread throughout the liver. As a result of that process, ALD attacks the liver at a certain point regardless of whether the patient is still drinking alcohol.\n\n\"Until now, now we had only few clues about why alcohol-related liver disease progresses the way it does, but this research fills in key pieces of the puzzle,\" says Patel.\n\nIn their studies, the team analyzed liver cells from patients, with a wide range in degree of disease severity, using RNA-sequencing. Their analysis showed that the level of cGAS expression was related to the degree of disease.\n\nIn a study of alcohol-fed mice, they found those animals also had higher expression of the cGAS-IrF3 pathway in liver cells.

When that happens in the human brain, the pileup of misfolded proteins can lead to neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's, Parkinson's and ALS.\n\nProteins do not misbehave and misfold out of the blue. There is a delicate ecosystem of biochemical interactions and environments that usually let them twist, unfold, refold and do their jobs as they're meant to.\n\nHowever, as researchers from Michigan Technological University explore in an article published in ACS Chemical Neuroscience, even a small change may cause long-term consequences.\n\nFor amyloid beta peptides -- considered a major hallmark of Alzheimer's disease -- a common chemical modification at a particular location on the molecule has a butterfly effect that leads to protein misfolding, aggregation and cellular toxicity.\n\nAshutosh Tiwari, associate professor of chemistry at Michigan Tech, explains that misfolded amyloid beta proteins tend to pile up and form aggregates, which can form stringy fibrils or balled-up amorphous shapes.\n\nTo understand what causes the different shapes and to assess their toxicity, Tiwari's team looked at acetylation.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAcetylation is one of the most common chemical modifications proteins undergo, but one of the least researched in terms of how it affects amyloid beta toxicity. On amyloid beta proteins, acetylation can occur at two sites: lysine 16 and lysine 28.\n\nThe team found that acetylation at lysine 16 led to the disordered aggregates that formed sticky but flexible amorphous structures and showed high levels of toxicity. They also found the aggregates showed higher free radical formation.\n\n\"No one has done a systematic study to show if you acetylate amyloid beta it changes how the aggregate looks, then it changes its biophysical properties and hence toxicity,\" Tiwari said. \"What we're saying is that the shape, stickiness and flexibility of the aggregated protein structure can play a vital role in the cellular toxicity and may also affect the mechanism of toxicity.\"\n\nIn Alzheimer's, these aggregates accumulate in the part of the brain that affects memory. It's a disease that the Alzheimer's Organization reports is the sixth leading cause of death in the US and will cost the nation about $305 billion in 2020. Tiwari says what we truly need to understand about the disease is that there is no single cause, no single trigger, and probably no silver bullet because of the chemistry involved.\n\n\"This is how a subtle change on a single position can affect a whole protein's aggregation,\" Tiwari said, adding that the effect of acetylation on tau, another protein aggregation, has been far more studied than amyloid beta. Also, many researchers still think a misfolded protein has to look a certain way to become problematic, and that other misfolded forms are less of an issue.\n\nTiwari agrees some of the proteins' changes are subtle, and compares discerning the differences and their effects to snow tires. Snow tires have deeper treads and a more flexible material to handle winter roads, but it's hard to point out those features at highway speeds. Like different kinds of tires, protein shapes can appear indistinguishable at a distance.\n\n\"This is not something that can be viewed from afar -- it's a touch-and-feel property,\" Tiwari said. \"We have to interrogate these properties. We have to look at these structures more deeply from both morphology and biophysical perspectives.\"\n\nWhen we do, we may better understand the complexity of the misfolded proteins and amyloid beta toxicity that can cause neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519165851.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T21:58:51", "title": "But it's a dry heat: Climate change and the aridification of North America", "text": "Discussions of drought often center on the lack of precipitation.

Declining flows in the region's two most important rivers, the Colorado and the Rio Grande, have been attributed in part to increasing temperatures caused by human activities, most notably the burning of fossil fuels.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMultiple processes tied to warming are likely implicated in the observed aridification of the West, according to Overpeck and Udall. For starters, warmer air can hold more water vapor, and this thirsty air draws moisture from water bodies and land surfaces through evaporation and evapotranspiration -- further drying soils, stressing plants and reducing streamflow.\n\nBut the atmosphere's increased capacity to hold water vapor also boosts the potential for precipitation; rain and snow amounts are, in fact, rising in many regions of the United States outside the Southwest. However, the frequency and intensity of dry spells and droughts are expected to increase across much of the continent in coming decades, even if average annual precipitation levels rise, according to Overpeck and Udall.\n\n\"Perhaps most troubling is the growing co-occurrence of hot and dry summer conditions, and the likely expansion, absent climate change action, of these hot-dry extremes all the way to the East Coast of North America, north deep into Canada, and south into Mexico,\" they write.\n\n\"Other parts of North America likely won't see the widespread aridification and decadal to multi-decadal droughts of the West, but will nonetheless continue to see more frequent and severe arid events -- extreme dry spells, flash droughts and interannual droughts will become part of the new normal,\" according to Overpeck and Udall.\n\n\"Unfortunately, climate change and this aridification are likely irreversible on human time scales, so the sooner emissions of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere are halted, the sooner the aridification of North America will stop getting worse.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519165849.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T21:58:49", "title": "NASA's Curiosity rover finds clues to chilly ancient Mars buried in rocks", "text": "By studying the chemical elements on Mars today -- including carbon and oxygen -- scientists can work backwards to piece together the history of a planet that once had the conditions necessary to support life.\n\nWeaving this story, element by element, from roughly 140 million miles (225 million kilometers) away is a painstaking process. But scientists aren't the type to be easily deterred. Orbiters and rovers at Mars have confirmed that the planet once had liquid water, thanks to clues that include dry riverbeds, ancient shorelines, and salty surface chemistry. Using NASA's Curiosity Rover, scientists have found evidence for long-lived lakes. They've also dug up organic compounds, or life's chemical building blocks. The combination of liquid water and organic compounds compels scientists to keep searching Mars for signs of past -- or present -- life.\n\nDespite the tantalizing evidence found so far, scientists' understanding of Martian history is still unfolding, with several major questions open for debate. For one, was the ancient Martian atmosphere thick enough to keep the planet warm, and thus wet, for the amount of time necessary to sprout and nurture life? And the organic compounds: are they signs of life -- or of chemistry that happens when Martian rocks interact with water and sunlight?\n\nIn a recent Nature Astronomy report on a multi-year experiment conducted in the chemistry lab inside Curiosity's belly, called Sample Analysis at Mars (SAM), a team of scientists offers some insights to help answer these questions. The team found that certain minerals in rocks at Gale Crater may have formed in an ice-covered lake. These minerals may have formed during a cold stage sandwiched between warmer periods, or after Mars lost most of its atmosphere and began to turn permanently cold.\n\nGale is a crater the size of Connecticut and Rhode Island combined. It was selected as Curiosity's 2012 landing site because it had signs of past water, including clay minerals that might help trap and preserve ancient organic molecules. Indeed, while exploring the base of a mountain in the center of the crater, called Mount Sharp, Curiosity found a layer of sediments 1,000 feet (304 meters) thick that was deposited as mud in ancient lakes. To form that much sediment an incredible amount of water would have flowed down into those lakes for millions to tens of millions of warm and humid years, some scientists say. But some geological features in the crater also hint at a past that included cold, icy conditions.\n\n\"At some point, Mars' surface environment must have experienced a transition from being warm and humid to being cold and dry, as it is now, but exactly when and how that occurred is still a mystery,\" says Heather Franz, a NASA geochemist based at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland.\n\nadvertisement\n\nFranz, who led the SAM study, notes that factors such as changes in Mars' obliquity and the amount of volcanic activity could have caused the Martian climate to alternate between warm and cold over time. This idea is supported by chemical and mineralogical changes in Martian rocks showing that some layers formed in colder environments and others formed in warmer ones.\n\nIn any case, says Franz, the array of data collected by Curiosity so far suggests that the team is seeing evidence for Martian climate change recorded in rocks.\n\nCarbon and oxygen star in the Martian climate story\n\nFranz's team found evidence for a cold ancient environment after the SAM lab extracted the gases carbon dioxide, or CO 2 , and oxygen from 13 dust and rock samples. Curiosity collected these samples over the course of five Earth years (Earth years vs. Mars years).\n\nCO 2 is a molecule of one carbon atom bonded with two oxygen atoms, with carbon serving as a key witness in the case of the mysterious Martian climate. In fact, this simple yet versatile element is as critical as water in the search for life elsewhere. On Earth, carbon flows continuously through the air, water, and surface in a well-understood cycle that hinges on life. For example, plants absorb carbon from the atmosphere in the form of CO 2 . In return, they produce oxygen, which humans and most other life forms use for respiration in a process that ends with the release of carbon back into the air, again via CO 2 , or into the Earth's crust as life forms die and are buried.\n\nadvertisement\n\nScientists are finding there's also a carbon cycle on Mars and they're working to understand it. With little water or abundant surface life on the Red Planet for at least the past 3 billion years, the carbon cycle is much different than Earth's.\n\n\"Nevertheless, the carbon cycling is still happening and is still important because it's not only helping reveal information about Mars' ancient climate,\" says Paul Mahaffy, principal investigator on SAM and director of the Solar System Exploration Division at NASA Goddard. \"It's also showing us that Mars is a dynamic planet that's circulating elements that are the buildings blocks of life as we know it.\"\n\nThe gases build a case for a chilly period\n\nAfter Curiosity fed rock and dust samples into SAM, the lab heated each one to nearly 1,650 degrees Fahrenheit (900 degrees Celsius) to liberate the gases inside. By looking at the oven temperatures that released the CO 2 and oxygen, scientists could tell what kind of minerals the gases were coming from. This type of information helps them understand how carbon is cycling on Mars.\n\nVarious studies have suggested that Mars' ancient atmosphere, containing mostly CO 2 , may have been thicker than Earth's is today. Most of it has been lost to space, but some may be stored in rocks at the planet's surface, particularly in the form of carbonates, which are minerals made of carbon and oxygen. On Earth, carbonates are produced when CO 2 from the air is absorbed in the oceans and other bodies of water and then mineralized into rocks. Scientists think the same process happened on Mars and that it could help explain what happened to some of the Martian atmosphere.\n\nYet, missions to Mars haven't found enough carbonates in the surface to support a thick atmosphere.\n\nNonetheless, the few carbonates that SAM did detect revealed something interesting about the Martian climate through the isotopes of carbon and oxygen stored in them. Isotopes are versions of each element that have different masses. Because different chemical processes, from rock formation to biological activity, use these isotopes in different proportions, the ratios of heavy to light isotopes in a rock provide scientists with clues to how the rock formed.\n\nIn some of the carbonates SAM found, scientists noticed that the oxygen isotopes were lighter than those in the Martian atmosphere. This suggests that the carbonates did not form long ago simply from atmospheric CO 2 absorbed into a lake. If they had, the oxygen isotopes in the rocks would have been slightly heavier than the ones in the air.\n\nWhile it's possible that the carbonates formed very early in Mars' history, when the atmospheric composition was a bit different than it is today, Franz and her colleagues suggest that the carbonates more likely formed in a freezing lake. In this scenario, the ice could have sucked up heavy oxygen isotopes and left the lightest ones to form carbonates later. Other Curiosity scientists have also presented evidence suggesting that ice-covered lakes could have existed in Gale Crater.\n\nSo where is all the carbon?\n\nThe low abundance of carbonates on Mars is puzzling, scientists say. If there aren't many of these minerals at Gale Crater, perhaps the early atmosphere was thinner than predicted. Or maybe something else is storing the missing atmospheric carbon.\n\nBased on their analysis, Franz and her colleagues suggest that some carbon could be sequestered in other minerals, such as oxalates, which store carbon and oxygen in a different structure than carbonates. Their hypothesis is based on the temperatures at which CO 2 was released from some samples inside SAM -- too low for carbonates, but just right for oxalates -- and on the different carbon and oxygen isotope ratios than the scientists saw in the carbonates.\n\nA model of a carbonate molecule next to an oxalate molecule\n\nOxalates are the most common type of organic mineral produced by plants on Earth. But oxalates also can be produced without biology. One way is through the interaction of atmospheric CO 2 with surface minerals, water, and sunlight, in a process known as abiotic photosynthesis. This type of chemistry is hard to find on Earth because there's abundant life here, but Franz's team hopes to create abiotic photosynthesis in the lab to figure out if it actually could be responsible for the carbon chemistry they're seeing in Gale Crater.\n\nOn Earth, abiotic photosynthesis may have paved the way for photosynthesis among some of the first microscopic life forms, which is why finding it on other planets interests astrobiologists.\n\nEven if it turns out that abiotic photosynthesis locked some carbon from the atmosphere into rocks at Gale Crater, Franz and her colleagues would like to study soil and dust from different parts of Mars to understand if their results from Gale Crater reflect a global picture. They may one day get a chance to do so.

Anderson, co-winner of the 1977 Nobel Prize in Physics who conducted theoretical studies of electron movements within disordered materials such as glass that lack a regular structure.)\n\nWang's recent studies have been made possible by a tool called quantum terahertz spectroscopy that can visualize and steer electrons. It uses terahertz laser flashes as a control knob to accelerate supercurrents and access new and potentially useful quantum states of matter. The National Science Foundation has supported development of the instrument as well as the current study of forbidden light.\n\nThe scientists say access to this and other quantum phenomena could help drive major innovations:\n\n\"Just like today's gigahertz transistors and 5G wireless routers replaced megahertz vacuum tubes or thermionic valves over half a century ago, scientists are searching for a leap forward in design principles and novel devices in order to achieve quantum computing and communication capabilities,\" said Perakis, with Alabama at Birmingham. \"Finding ways to control, access and manipulate the special characteristics of the quantum world and connect them to real-world problems is a major scientific push these days.

Second harmonic generation is a fundamental symmetry probe. This will be useful in the development of future quantum computing strategies and electronics with high speeds and low energy consumption.\"\n\nBefore they can get there, though, researchers need to do more exploring of the quantum world.

She quickly realized that the animal's skeletal structure matched not only some ichthyosaurs she was studying in a fossil museum on the English Channel coast, but also some elsewhere in the United Kingdom.\n\nJacobs and paleontologist Nikolay G. Zverkov of the Russian Academy of Sciences -- who \"fished\" for the ichthyosaur -- merged their research, studying their collective photos and other materials and ultimately determining that the Russian and English ichthyosaurs were of the same genus and far more common and widespread than scientists believed.\n\nTheir study is published in the Zoological Journal of the Linnean Society.\n\n\"Ichthyosaurs swam the seas of our planet for about 76 million years,\" Jacobs said. \"But this 5-foot ichthyosaur from some 150 million years ago was the least known and believed to be among the rarest ichthyosaurs.

What we showed is that it's not the exception, it's the rule,\" said co-lead author and environmental sociologist Simone Pulver, of UC Santa Barbara.\n\nThe study by Pulver and Mary Collins of State University New York, Syracuse, is the first to establish disproportionality in the production of toxic pollution both across a wide range of industries and over an extended period of time.\n\nThe researchers examined U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) data, spanning the years 1998 to 2012, on toxic releases from more than 25,000 facilities in 322 manufacturing industries.\n\nThe results are striking.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The more you compare like facilities, the more you see a handful of facilities are accounting for the majority of the toxic pollution emitted in one year from that industry,\" said Pulver, an associate professor of environmental studies. \"It's a consistent pattern across a wide range of industries. It's an egregious pattern because it's really extreme, and it's an incredibly stable pattern over time.\"\n\nSaid lead author Collins, \"Not all polluters are the same, even those who seem like they should be, because they operate in the same industry, produce similar goods, et cetera. Instead, a small group generate much more harm than the rest. This finding is not entirely new, but with Simone and our two graduate students (Dustin Hill and Ben Manski), we show that this is widely true across industries and time.\"\n\nThe research has significant implications for the regulation of toxic pollution and suggests that major reductions to pollution could be achieved by focusing on a relatively small number of facilities doing the most polluting.\n\nAs Collins explained, \"there are a handful of facilities that alone generate more than 50 percent of their entire industry's emissions.\" Of the more than 25,000 facilities analyzed, 1,116 can be characterized as egregious polluters, defined as single facilities that generated 50% or more of the total annual hazard within an industry.\n\n\"But it's complicated,\" Pulver noted. Making it so, among other complexities, is that it's not always the same facilities each year doing the egregious polluting. Of the group of super polluting facilities, the researchers noted, only 31 facilities are \"consistently egregious polluters within their industries throughout the study period.\"\n\nIn their study, Collins and Pulver looked at more than 300 industries that reported toxic emissions, had more than five facilities reporting emissions each year and had data about their employees, overall providing a solid characterization of the U.S. manufacturing sector.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe researchers were careful to compare things as similar as possible, such as facilities making the same product and with access to the same technology, and to control for facility size.\n\nFinding that \"the generation of environmental harm is not distributed equally across units but rather concentrated within a small group of egregious actors,\" their results challenge the presumption of proportionality between economic activity and environmental harm.\n\n\"Even with all the controls -- the same business done in the same way -- you see this real inequality,\" Pulver said. \"A lot of facilities are not producing much toxic pollution at all to make their product, while a small handful are producing a whole lot of toxic pollution to do the exact same thing.\"\n\n\"You expect inequality when you look at the economy as a whole -- there are more resource intensive businesses, things are not evenly distributed in nature, and so on,\" she continued. \"But that's why I find this pattern so surprising. We expected to see some of it but not for it to be this extensive.\"\n\nSome interesting details: The highest level of disproportionality uncovered by the researchers was in the \"All Other Basic Inorganic Chemical Manufacturing\" category; the lowest was in industrial mold manufacturing. The biggest increase in inequality, over the course of the study, occurred in bitumous coal underground mining.\n\nTaken altogether, the findings have both scholarly and policy implications for the nature of pollution generation, for the role of targeting in environmental regulatory decision-making and for efforts by environmental advocates, according to the authors.\n\n\"There are some facilities where there are real opportunities for learning and improvements to bring them in line with other facilities in their industries,\" Pulver said. \"There is a standard that's possible in terms of damage to environment, and that standard is demonstrated by a vast majority of facilities. Here is an opportunity to get that handful of facilities up to that standard.\"\n\nAlthough this paper is the first to empirically document this disproportionality across a wide range of industries and across time, the notion that this pattern may exist was posited in 2005 by another UC Santa Barbara environmental sociologist, Bill Freudenburg, Collins' dissertation advisors and Pulver's mentors.\n\n\"His was the first paper that put this idea on the map,\" Pulver said. \"So there is a long, great history of this research here at UC Santa Barbara.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519153506.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T20:35:06", "title": "Ribs evolved for movement first, then co-opted for breathing: First study on role of ribs in locomotion reveal same mechanics as in aspiration breathing in lizards", "text": "When early tetrapods transitioned from water to land the way they breathed air underwent an evolutionary revolution.

But what caused the shift?\n\nA new study published on May 12 in Scientific Reports posits a new hypothesis -- the intermediate step was driven by locomotion.\n\nWhen lizards walk, they bend side-to-side in a sprawling gait. The ribs and vertebrae are crucial to this movement, but it was unclear how until now. Researchers captured the 3-D motion of lizard ribs and vertebrae using XROMM, a combination of CT scans and X-ray videos. They recorded three savannah monitor lizards and three Argentine black and white tegus walking slowly on a treadmill. The resulting images revealed that while the spine is bending, every rib in both species rotated substantially around its vertebral joint, twisting forward on one side of the body and backward on the other side alternatively with each stride. The mechanics follow nearly the same pattern as when the reptiles inhale and exhale.\n\n\"It's really exciting because we didn't previously have plausible hypotheses for how rib-breathing evolved,\" said first author Robert Cieri, a postdoc at the University of the Sunshine Coast and who conducted the research while at the University of Utah, where he is still affiliated. \"We're proposing that these rib movements first started to facilitate locomotion, then were co-opted for breathing.\"\n\nThe work also included John Capano and Elizabeth Brainerd at Brown University, and undergraduate Samuel Hatch at the U.\n\nWhy did the lizard cross the road? To catch its breath.\n\nReptiles, birds and mammals, all considered amniotes, use costal aspiration where the ribs and vertebrae control breathing by expanding and contracting. The motion is facilitated by the ribs rotating around the vertebrocostal joints -- where the ribs and vertebrae meet. It's possible that an early amniote ancestor first used these rib movements to enhance its lateral undulation, the side-to-side trunk motion that helps propel lizards forward. During locomotion, each limb has two phases: First is propulsion, which is when the foot is pushing against the ground. Second is swing, which is when the foot is in the air. The new research found that during the arm's propulsion phase, the ribs on the same side of the body rotate towards the head, and while it's in the swing phase, they rotate towards the tail. This mimics what the scientists previously found the ribs doing inhalation and exhalation -- but this time simultaneously on both sides.\n\nEarly tetrapods used sprawling, undulatory locomotion, but likely still had a head-driven breathing system. The authors propose that rib movements and increased costal joint mobility evolved during locomotion to increase stride length, hold the thorax steady, or as the passive result of the ribs moving to prevent being bunched together as the animals bended. At some point, early amniotes evolved the ability to express these rib movements on both sides simultaneously, which allowed for the expansion and contraction of the trunk that support inhalation and exhalation.\n\n\"Aspiration breathing was one of the key innovations that allowed amniotes to diversify on land. We were surprised and thrilled to find clues to how it evolved from a study on locomotion,\" co-author Brainerd said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519144456.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:44:56", "title": "Electrons break rotational symmetry in exotic low-temp superconductor", "text": "Scientists have discovered that the transport of electronic charge in a metallic superconductor containing strontium, ruthenium, and oxygen breaks the rotational symmetry of the underlying crystal lattice. The strontium ruthenate crystal has fourfold rotational symmetry like a square, meaning that it looks identical when turned by 90 degrees (four times to equal a complete 360-degree rotation). However, the electrical resistivity has twofold (180-degree) rotational symmetry like a rectangle.\n\nThis \"electronic nematicity\" -- the discovery of which is reported in a paper published on May 4 in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences -- may promote the material's \"unconventional\" superconductivity. For unconventional superconductors, standard theories of metallic conduction are inadequate to explain how upon cooling they can conduct electricity without resistance (i.e., losing energy to heat). If scientists can come up with an appropriate theory, they may be able to design superconductors that don't require expensive cooling to achieve their near-perfect energy efficiency.\n\n\"We imagine a metal as a solid framework of atoms, through which electrons flow like a gas or liquid,\" said corresponding author Ivan Bozovic, a senior scientist and the leader of the Oxide Molecular Beam Epitaxy Group in the Condensed Matter Physics and Materials Science (CMPMS) Division at the U.S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Brookhaven National Laboratory and an adjunct professor in the Department of Chemistry at Yale. \"Gases and liquids are isotropic, meaning their properties are uniform in all directions. The same is true for electron gases or liquids in ordinary metals like copper or aluminum. But in the last decade, we have learned that this isotropy doesn't seem to hold in some more exotic metals.\"\n\nScientists have previously observed symmetry-breaking electronic nematicity in other unconventional superconductors. In 2017, Bozovic and his team detected the phenomenon in a metallic compound containing lanthanum, strontium, copper, and oxygen (LSCO), which becomes superconducting at relatively higher (but still ultracold) temperatures compared to low-temperature counterparts like strontium ruthenate. The LSCO crystal lattice also has square symmetry, with two equal periodicities, or arrangements of atoms, in the vertical and horizontal directions. But the electrons do not obey this symmetry; the electrical resistivity is higher in one direction unaligned with the crystal axes.\n\n\"We see this kind of behavior in liquid crystals, which polarize light in TVs and other displays,\" said Bozovic. \"Liquid crystals flow like liquids but orient in a preferred direction like solids because the molecules have an elongated rod-like shape. This shape constrains rotation by the molecules when packed close together. Liquids are typically symmetric with respect to any rotation, but liquid crystals break such rotational symmetry, with their properties different in the parallel and perpendicular directions. This is what we saw in LSCO -- the electrons behave like an electronic liquid crystal.\"\n\nWith this surprising discovery, the scientists wondered whether electronic nematicity existed in other unconventional superconductors. To begin addressing this question, they decided to focus on strontium ruthenate, which has the same crystal structure as LSCO and strongly interacting electrons.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAt the Kavli Institute at Cornell for Nanoscale Science, Darrell Schlom, Kyle Shen, and their collaborators grew single-crystal thin films of strontium ruthenate one atomic layer at a time on square substrates and rectangular ones, which elongated the films in one direction. These films have to be extremely uniform in thickness and composition -- having on the order of one impurity per trillion atoms -- to become superconducting.\n\nTo verify that the crystal periodicity of the films was the same as that of the underlying substrates, the Brookhaven Lab scientists performed high-resolution x-ray diffraction experiments.\n\n\"X-ray diffraction allows us to precisely measure the lattice periodicity of both the films and the substrates in different directions,\" said coauthor and CMPMS Division X-ray Scattering Group Leader Ian Robinson, who made the measurements. \"In order to determine whether the lattice distortion plays a role in nematicity, we first needed to know if there is any distortion and how much.\"\n\nBozovic's group then patterned the millimeter-sized films into a \"sunbeam\" configuration with 36 lines arranged radially in 10-degree increments. They passed electrical current through these lines -- each of which contained three pairs of voltage contacts -- and measured the voltages vertically along the lines (longitudinal direction) and horizontally across them (transverse direction). These measurements were collected over a range of temperatures, generating thousands of data files per thin film.\n\nCompared to the longitudinal voltage, the transverse voltage is 100 times more sensitive to nematicity. If the current flows with no preferred direction, the transverse voltage should be zero at every angle. That wasn't the case, indicating that strontium ruthenate is electronically nematic -- 10 times more so than LSCO. Even more surprising was that the films grown on both square and rectangular substrates had the same magnitude of nematicity -- the relative difference in resistivity between two directions -- despite the lattice distortion caused by the rectangular substrate. Stretching the lattice only affected the nematicity orientation, with the direction of highest conductivity running along the shorter side of the rectangle. Nematicity is already present in both films at room temperature and significantly increases as the films are cooled down to the superconducting state.\n\n\"Our observations point to a purely electronic origin of nematicity,\" said Bozovic. \"Here, interactions between electrons bumping into each other appear to have a much stronger contribution to electrical resistivity than electrons interacting with the crystal lattice, as they do in conventional metals.\"\n\nGoing forward, the team will continue to test their hypothesis that electronic nematicity exists in all nonconventional superconductors.\n\n\"The synergy between the two CMPMS Division groups at Brookhaven was critical to this research,\" said Bozovic. \"We will apply our complementary expertise, techniques, and equipment in future studies looking for signatures of electronic nematicity in other materials with strongly interacting electrons.\"\n\nThis work was funded by the DOE Office of Science, the Gordon and Betty Moore Foundation, and the National Science Foundation.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519144454.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:44:54", "title": "Observing the freely behaving brain in action", "text": "Scientists working at caesar have developed a small head-mounted microscope that allows access to the inner workings of the brain. The new system enables measurement of activity from neuronal populations located in the deep cortical layer with single-cell resolution, in an animal that is freely behaving.\n\nUnderstanding how animals use their brain circuitry to generate behavior in response to their environment is one of the central goals of neuroscience. While it is possible to study animal behavior by observing how an animal solves problems, to gain an understanding of the brain's role in generating the behavior the brain circuit activity must be measured at the same time.\n\nIn vivo imaging is, of course, nothing new in biology: it dates back to the very beginnings of microscopy. To look inside the brain, special microscopes can be used that can see through the tissue enabling the observation of neuronal circuits at work. Using a microscope to image neural activity has the advantage of being relatively non-invasive. Mounted outside the brain, the microscope simply sends light into the brain, in turn receiving the light emitted out of the brain. While conventional microscopes are too heavy to enable functional imaging from freely behaving animals, over the last years significant effort has gone into developing head-mounted miniaturized microscopes.\n\nIn 2009, Jason Kerr's group, in collaboration with the group of Winfried Denk at the Max Planck Institute of Neurobiology (Martinsried), established a miniaturized head-mounted multiphoton microscope. It enabled recording of activity from neuronal populations located in the upper few layers in visual cortex of awake, freely moving rats. While this 'two-photon fiberscope' was a breakthrough in measuring brain activity from freely behaving animals, most of the cortical layers remained out of reach. To image the deeper layers of the cortex on a cellular level, a new approach was needed.\n\nIn collaboration with Philip Russell's group at the Max Planck Institute for the Science of Light, Kerr's group has now developed a small head-mounted multiphoton microscope, capable of imaging all cortical layers in a freely moving rat. Light is delivered through a custom designed and manufactured glass fiber, utilizing the 'three-photon effect' to image neuronal activity located in deep cortical layers. Compared to two-photon or one-photon fluorescence microscopy, three-photon is ideal for imaging deeper in scattering tissue, and enables clearer images of single cells deep in the tissue. The new microscope allows for continuous imaging of neuron populations, even when the animal runs or performs complex behavioral tasks, over extended periods of time.\n\nThe researchers expect the fiberscope to be widely applicable to behavioral research, as previous microscopes were limited in their imaging depth and unsuitable for use over extended periods of time, restricting the types of behaviors that could be observed. With this new approach, researchers are now able to understand the complex network dynamics that underlie neural computation which, in turn, forms the basis of perception and behavior.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519144452.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:44:52", "title": "Cooperation can be contagious particularly when people see the benefit for others", "text": "Seeing someone do something good for someone else motivates witnesses to perform their own helpful acts, an insight that could help drive cooperative behavior in communities navigating through the health crisis.\n\nIn a new study, psychology researchers at The University of Texas at Austin confirmed that people can be heavily influenced by others, especially when it comes to taking on prosocial behavior -- actions designed to benefit society as a whole. Understanding this is important now, when large-scale cooperation and adoption of protective behaviors -- wearing face masks and avoiding gatherings -- have important implications for the well-being of entire communities, the researchers said.\n\n\"Just like the deadly virus, cooperative behavior can also be transmitted across people,\" said Haesung (Annie) Jung, who led the study while earning a Ph.D. at UT Austin. \"These findings remind the public that their behavior can impact what others around do; and the more individuals cooperate to stop the spread of the disease, the more likely others nearby will do the same.\"\n\nReviewing the evidence from decades of studies, the researchers found that exposing people to \"prosocial models\" -- watching someone perform an act of kindness -- elicited some subsequent helpful acts. This response was partly driven by \"goal contagion,\" researchers said, whereby witnessing prosocial actions lead people to adopt the underlying goal associated with the observed behavior, such as caring for others' well-being.\n\n\"We found that people can readily improvise new forms of prosocial actions. They engaged in behaviors that were different from what they witnessed and extended help to different targets in need than those helped by the prosocial model,\" said Jung, who is now a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.\n\nThe magnitude of this type of influence varied across societies, with Asian countries most likely to be influenced by modeling, followed by European countries, then North American.\n\nThey also found that people were more motivated to help after witnessing other people benefit from the prosocial model than when they benefitted from the prosocial act. This shows that the effect triggered by adopting others' prosocial goals outweighed other potential motives triggered by self-benefit, such as doing it because they felt grateful.\n\nThe researchers suggested that adopting this type of framework could go a long way in influencing new prosocial behaviors amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"Many people may choose to avoid social distancing practices because they don't think they're likely to contract the virus or experience serious symptoms.

Demographic data for race/ethnicity, socioeconomic status, first-generation college student, and gender were collected. In addition to greater self-confidence, the findings reveal that students who take field courses are more likely to graduate from college, have higher GPAs at graduation, and are more likely to stay in the ecology and evolutionary biology major. Even a modest, two-unit field course produces benefits for students: at UCSC, Biology 82: Introduction to Field Research meets once a week with two overnight weekend field trips.\n\n\"Field courses offer some potentially high-impact services that aren't available in traditional lecture courses,\" said postdoctoral researcher and first author Roxanne Beltran. \"Students in field courses work as a team and collaborate rather than compete for the best grade. They get to sit around a campfire and feel like part of a community. And they are interacting with faculty who aren't standing behind a lectern, which can be intimidating.\"\n\nAs participants build confidence in field courses, the experience creates \"a self-fulfilling prophecy of success,\" she said. \"It's a feedback loop. Students see that they can be successful, which builds their confidence, which leads to further success.\"\n\nBeltran, who is completing a two-year fellowship funded by the National Science Foundation and the UC President's Postdoctoral Fellowship Program, says field courses are one of the best investment colleges and universities can make in \"saving dreams\" of aspiring scientists.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Diversity in STEM fields is critical,\" said Beltran. \"Scientists can help solve global challenges like disease outbreaks and climate change. But we can't do that without the diversity of ideas that comes from diverse experiences. Our success is tied unequivocally to the diversity of the scientists doing the work.\"\n\nSaving dreams and closing demographic gaps\n\nFor aspiring biology majors, the first two years of college courses are dominated by what some call the \"math-science death march\": a series of required courses in math, chemistry, physics, and biology that are a far cry from the vision that propels most undergraduates.\n\n\"Students who want to do biology in college have a vision of studying trees, or birds, or soils, or marine invertebrates in the intertidal zone,\" said senior author Erika Zavaleta, a professor of ecology and evolutionary biology at UCSC. \"They have a vision of discovery, of being outside, of doing data collection.\"\n\nField courses give students hands-on experience doing science in collaboration with their peers: identifying species, designing and conducting experiments, analyzing data, and doing oral presentations of results. \"Field courses have a big positive impact on students' sense of their scientific capacity,\" said Zavaleta. \"It's true for all students, but it's bigger for underrepresented groups than any other.\"\n\nIn the study, which focused on the self-efficacy benefits of field courses, underrepresented students ranked their own sense of ability lower before they participated in the field course, but they emerged from the course with their sense of self-efficacy on par or ahead of their non-underrepresented peers, she noted.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The course closed a demographic gap,\" said Zavaleta. \"That's so exciting.\"\n\nField courses may be more expensive than large lecture courses, which Zavaleta said are \"very efficient.\" \"But you get what you pay for,\" she said. \"The impact on students is greater. We need to rethink how much we invest in these experiences.\"\n\n\"If students have an early opportunity that validates what being a scientist is, that can carry them and keep them going until they get upper-division opportunities to do an internship, or a research project, or a senior thesis,\" said Zavaleta. \"Let's give these students the opportunity to do what they came here to do before they get to year three of their college experience.\"\n\nRetaining diversity in STEM\n\nUndergraduates from diverse demographic backgrounds arrive at college equally interested in studying biology, but students from groups that are underrepresented in STEM fields are significantly less likely to earn a biology degree, either because they switch majors or leave campus entirely, said Zavaleta. That phenomenon, which takes place at colleges and universities across the country, has put the focus on retaining STEM students.\n\n\"They're coming to us across the board wanting to do biology, and it's on us to keep them and help them succeed,\" said Zavaleta, noting that most students leave the Ecology and Evolutionary Biology major during their first year or two.\n\nBoosting self-efficacy is one part of a retention strategy, but efforts must also address building a sense of belonging and a sense of community for underrepresented students, noted Zavaleta, a veteran field-course instructor. \"Field courses are such an important tool because they tackle both,\" she said. \"There's nothing like making a meal together on a camping trip, or identifying a grass, or sloshing in a stream, or sitting around a campfire to build a sense of community.\"\n\nBeltran, a UCSC alumna, recalled struggling to find her place in 400-student lecture courses before she enrolled in a quarter-long field course with Zavaleta. \"I'm studying these students, because I was one of them,\" said Beltran. \"I was questioning whether I deserved to be in college, and whether I could have a career in science.\" The field course rekindled the desire she'd had in high school, and in July, she will join the UCSC faculty as an assistant professor of ecology and evolutionary biology (EEB).\n\n\"The emphasis was really different when I was an undergraduate student,\" she said. \"We've learned a lot since then about the importance of teaching in nontraditional ways.\"\n\nEncouraging all students to feel welcome\n\nIn the study, the researchers found that underrepresented students are less likely to enroll in field courses. That problem, however, is not insurmountable.\n\n\"We've spent five years flipping that,\" said Zavaleta, a dedicated advocate of STEM diversity who received a $1 million grant in 2017 from the Howard Hughes Medical Institute to fund a five-year effort to support students in ecology and conservation biology all the way through to graduation. Her program provides increased access to research-based field courses and internships, as well as mentoring and a supportive community, with the goal of launching a diverse new generation of conservation leaders.\n\n\"We think of field courses as gated and maybe elitist, because they can be expensive, or we think they're only for students who already have camping equipment and experience,\" said Zavaleta. But those barriers can be overcome, she said. When Biology 82 was introduced, instructors Don Croll and Gage Dayton made a concerted effort to get the word out to all students through UCSC's ten colleges, student groups and organizations, and academic advisers. Scholarships remove cost barriers, and the relatively small weekend time commitment helps make the course available to students who work, she noted.\n\n\"Over time, the word gets out, and now we have students across campus participating -- not just white students, not just wealthy students, not just biology students, and most haven't camped before,\" said Zavaleta, noting that Biology 82 is offered six times per year but still can't meet student demand. \"If you tackle the relatively easy barriers, field courses become an engine for inclusion and equity.\"\n\nZavaleta is excited by the results of the study \"because they show us that it's true.\"\n\n\"Why can't every student in the major have a field experience?\" she asked. \"Why can't every student in the division? Every student on campus? This is how UCSC started: It was all about inquiry in peer groups. We know how to do this, and we are doing it. We just need to do it for everybody.\"\n\nAdditional coauthors on the study include Don Croll, professor of ecology and evolutionary biology; Gage Dayton, administrative director of the UCSC Natural Reserve System; Erin Marnocha, program coordinator with the UC Natural Reserve System; and Alexandra Race, a graduate student in education at UCSC.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519144442.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:44:42", "title": "Aggressive carbon taxation could help US meet targets in Paris agreement", "text": "Nearly all the countries of the world ratified the Paris Agreement in 2016.

To do this, global greenhouse gas emissions would have to decrease roughly 25% below 2010 levels by 2030 and reach almost zero by 2070. As one of the largest emitters of greenhouse gases, the United States -- which intends to withdraw from the Paris Agreement -- will play a central role in whether these targets are met.\n\nIn this context, a new study looked at U.S. tax policy as it relates to carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), from 2015 through 2030. The study found only limited short-term opportunities for decarbonization (reducing greenhouse gas emissions) outside the electricity sector. The result is substantial CO 2 tax revenue. The findings shed light on future tax policy decisions.\n\nThe study, conducted by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU), appears in Environmental Research Communications.\n\n\"Our findings point to clear opportunities to replace revenue from distortionary taxes (like the income tax) with revenue from carbon taxes, which enhance the efficiency of the U.S. economy.\" says Nicholas Muller, Associate Professor of Economics, Engineering, and Public Policy at CMU's Tepper School of Business, who coauthored the study.\n\nThe researchers used an energy-optimization model to simulate energy use by sector, fuel type and technology, system costs, and pollution emissions under two carbon tax policies. Their analysis included CO 2 emissions as well as emissions of local air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, nitrogen oxides, and particulate matter.\n\nThe study found that opportunities for significant reductions of CO 2 in the short-term were limited to the electric-generation sector. As such, the other sectors subject to carbon taxation continued emitting. This will produce substantial carbon tax revenue. In total, revenues amounted to between 8% and 34% of all federal income tax revenue. Because carbon taxes provide strong incentives for innovation in low-carbon technologies, the authors project that enduring carbon taxes will enhance abatement in other sectors which will reduce future revenue.\n\nDeep uncertainties in the climate system and the future effects of climate change on human civilization mean that the correct carbon tax rate is not known. Acknowledging this uncertainty, the authors explored the consequences of erroneous CO 2 taxes. They found that it would be four times more costly to the economy to under tax CO 2 than to over tax it, which they argue makes the case for invoking the precautionary principle (erring on the side of more aggressive CO 2 policy rather than lax policy) on the grounds of efficiency.\n\n\"The reductions in CO 2 emissions that we project would put the United States on track to meet the nationally determined contributions established under the Paris Agreement,\" says Michael Buchdahl Roth, doctoral student in the Department of Engineering and Public Policy at CMU. \"But our results also suggest a need for cost-effective low carbon technology innovation that would allow decarbonization beyond the electricity generation sector.

This may be due in part to a decline in mitochondria, the tiny powerhouses inside of our cells, which provide energy and regulate metabolism. In fact, mitochondria decline with age not only in humans, but in many species. Why they do so is not well understood. Scientists at the Max Planck Institute for Biology of Ageing in Cologne set out to understand how mitochondrial function is diminished with age and to find factors that prevent this process. They found that communication between mitochondria and other parts of the cell plays a key role.\n\nFor their studies, the scientists used the simple roundworm, Caenorhabditis elegans, an important model system for ageing research. Over half the genes of this animal are similar to those found in humans, and their mitochondria also decline with age. From their research, the scientists found a nuclear protein called NFYB-1 that switches on and off genes affecting mitochondrial activity, and which itself goes down during ageing. In mutant worms lacking this protein, mitochondria don't work as well and worms don't live as long.\n\nUnexpectedly, the scientists discovered that NFYB-1 steers the activity of mitochondria through another part of the cell called the lysosome, a place where basic molecules are broken down and recycled as nutrients. \"We think the lysosome talks with the mitochondria through special fats called cardiolipins and ceramides, which are essential to mitochondrial activity,\" says Max Planck Director, Adam Antebi, whose laboratory spearheaded the study. Remarkably, simply feeding the NFYB-1 mutant worms cardiolipin restored mitochondrial function and worm health in these strains.\n\nBecause cardiolipins and ceramides are also essential for human mitochondria, this may mean human health and ageing can be improved by understanding on how such molecules facilitate communication between different parts of the cell.

How environmental protection and poverty reduction can be reconciled", "text": "Palm oil is often associated with tropical deforestation above all else. However, this is only one side of the story, as agricultural scientists from the University of G\u00f6ttingen and the IPB University Bogor (Indonesia) show in a new study. The rapid expansion of oil palm has also contributed considerably to economic growth and poverty reduction in local communities, particularly in Asia. The study was published in the Annual Review of Resource Economics.\n\nFor the study, the researchers evaluated results from over 30 years of research on the environmental, economic and social consequences of oil palm cultivation in Africa, Asia and Latin America. They combined the results from the international literature with their own data from Indonesia, which they have been collecting since 2012 as part of an interdisciplinary German-Indonesian Collaborative Research Centre (CRC 990). Indonesia is the largest palm oil producer and exporter in the world. A large proportion of the palm oil produced in Indonesia is exported to Europe and the USA, where it is used by the food, fuel and cosmetics industries.\n\nThe research data show that the expansion of oil palm in some regions of the world -- especially Indonesia and Malaysia -- contributes significantly to tropical deforestation and the loss of biodiversity. Clearing forestland also leads to substantial carbon emissions and other environmental problems. \"However, banning palm oil production and trade would not be a sustainable solution,\" says Professor Matin Qaim, agricultural economist at the University of G\u00f6ttingen and first author of the study. \"The reason is that oil palm produces three times more oil per hectare than soybean, rapeseed, or sunflower. This means that if palm oil was replaced with alternative vegetable oils, much more land would be needed for cultivation, with additional loss of forests and other natural habitats.\"\n\nBanning palm oil would also have negative economic and social consequences in the producing countries. \"It is often assumed that oil palm is only grown on large industrial plantations,\" says Qaim. \"In reality, however, around half of the world's palm oil is produced by smallholder farmers. Our data show that oil palm cultivation increases profits and incomes in the small farm sector, in addition to raising wages and creating additional employment for rural labourers. Although there are incidents of conflicts over land, overall the oil palm boom has significantly reduced rural poverty in Indonesia and other producing countries.\"\n\n\"The goal should be to make palm oil production more environmentally and climate-friendly,\" says Professor Ingo Grass, agricultural ecologist at the University of Hohenheim and co-author of the study. \"High yields on the already-cultivated land are important, in order to reduce additional deforestation. Mosaic landscapes, where oil palm is combined with patches of forest and other crops in agroforestry systems, could also help to protect biodiversity and ecosystem functions,\" he adds.\n\nThe authors conclude that developing and implementing more sustainable production systems are challenges which require both innovative research and policymaking. Clearly and fairly defined land rights and improved access for smallholder farmers to training, credit and modern technologies would be important steps forward.

Connected and automated vehicles that communicate to coordinate optimal traffic patterns could enable this pleasant driving scenario sooner than you think.\n\nAt the University of Delaware, a research group of students is developing algorithms for connected and automated vehicles that reduce energy consumption and travel delays. The Information and Decision Science Lab is led by Andreas Malikopoulos, Terri Connor Kelly and John Kelly Career Development Associate Professor.\n\nConnected and automated vehicles use technology such as sensors, cameras and advanced control algorithms to adjust their operation to changing conditions with little or no input from drivers.\n\nFor doctoral student A M Ishtiaque Mahbub, the project has offered unprecedented opportunities. He is the first author of two new technical papers published by SAE -- formerly known as the Society of Automotive Engineers -- describing how UD engineers optimized vehicle dynamics and powertrain operation using connectivity and automation as well as how they developed and tested a control framework that reduced travel time and energy use in a connected and automated vehicle.\n\nThe team is optimizing an Audi A3 e-tron, a plug-in hybrid electric vehicle. First, the team members developed control architectures to reduce stop-and-go driving and travel time while ensuring that energy efficiency. Next, the team tested the algorithms using driving simulators in UD's Spencer Laboratory.\n\nThen, in October 2019, they put their work to the test in the University of Michigan's MCity, a testing ground for cutting-edge vehicles. The software developed at UD went into the Audi A3 e-tron.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOn test day, Mahbub stepped into the test car with two other engineers from Bosch. Each was equipped with a laptop to take data as they drove along a track that included a roundabout, merging zone, intersection and other challenges. The connected and automated vehicle is designed to take over and navigate these situations for you.\n\n\"This alleviates stress, and by eliminating stop-and-go driving behavior where you're constantly braking and accelerating, braking and accelerating, or even yielding, it also has a smooth margin in those cases, which also as a byproduct increases the fuel efficiency,\" said Mahbub.\n\nVirtual reality was used to simulate challenges for the car to navigate around, such as other cars and pedestrians.\n\nWith months of preparation behind him, Mahbub was excited for the test, but nervous, too. \"There is a certain level of uncertainty that plays on your mind, that, OK: The theory and control algorithms worked in simulation, but how about in the real world?\" he said. \"How might the real-world uncertainties and unknown variables affect the system?\"\n\nThe test was a success, with a 30 percent increase in energy efficiency, more than the simulation even predicted.\n\nThe real-world scenario helped Mahbub put his analysis in context, gain an even greater understanding of the vehicle's control architecture, and collect data that could be used to realize and quantify even greater gains in energy efficiency.\n\n\"At one point in the field test I was feeling a bit nauseous because the centrifugal force was a little too much,\" he said. \"I'm thinking right now going forward if we plan to visit MCity, I will definitely put that in my algorithm so that the passengers will have a more comfortable drive.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519140416.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:04:16", "title": "Rapid screening method targets fatty acids in yeast; Key to sustainable bioproducts", "text": "Scientists engineering valuable microbes for renewable fuels and bioproducts have developed a fast, efficient way to identify the most promising varieties.\n\nResearchers at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign developed a novel mass spectrometry-based screening technique to rapidly profile medium-chain fatty acids produced in yeast -- part of a larger group of free fatty acids that are key components in essential nutrients, soaps, industrial chemicals, and fuels. They also identified seven new genetically engineered mutants of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae that produce higher levels of those fatty acids.\n\nThe study is detailed in a paper published in the journal Biotechnology and Bioengineering. The research was performed at the Center for Advanced Bioenergy and Bioproducts Innovation (CABBI), a U.S. Department of Energy-funded Bioenergy Research Center, by two U of I professors: Huimin Zhao, Professor of Chemical and Biomolecular Engineering (ChBE), and Jonathan Sweedler, Professor of Chemistry and Director of the School of Chemical Sciences. The lead author is Pu Xue, a ChBE doctoral student with Zhao's lab at CABBI.\n\nZhao's group genetically engineers tiny yeast cells to increase production of fatty acids, crucial components of biodiesel, fatty alcohols, waxes and olefins -- the building blocks for detergents, adhesives, and plastics. CABBI's goal is to develop robust yeasts that can convert renewable plant biomass to fuels and chemicals, as an environmentally friendly and sustainable alternative to petroleum-based chemical manufacturing processes.\n\nScientists can create a large library of engineered yeast strains, or mutants, producing various MCFAs very quickly, Xue said. But their ability to control the exact composition of MCFAs produced in these microbial cell factories is limited, with no \"high-throughput\" way to quickly analyze large numbers of samples.\n\nTo overcome this limitation, Xue and other researchers worked with Sweedler's group to develop a high-throughput screening tool, a chemical characterization approach based on MALDI-ToF MS (matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry). Mass spectrometry is an information-rich way to analyze complex samples by measuring their mass-to-charge ratio of ions. A laser is shot at a colony of yeast on a slide; the instrument measures the molecular masses of the lipids in the yeast, and thus is able to identify them.\n\nadvertisement\n\nMost existing processes for detecting or analyzing free fatty acids rely on more complex gas or liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry, considered the gold standard methods. But those methods have limitations when dealing with a large pool of variations, and preparing samples is time-consuming and labor-intensive.\n\nThe overall approach using the MALDI-ToF MS system is faster and has been used successfully with proteins and peptides. The ToF mass analyzer is fast, relatively low cost and has a large detection window, well-suited for screening complex biological targets.\n\nBut medium-chain fatty acids are highly volatile and lightweight, making them harder to detect and quantify with this approach. Moreover, the thick cell wall of yeast creates another challenge for researchers to decompose cellular compositions efficiently.\n\nSo the CABBI researchers optimized the sample preparation steps with various solvents and matrices. And instead of trying to directly detect the MCFAs, they used a proxy: membrane lipids in yeast cells. They hypothesized that increased levels of membrane lipids with shorter acyl chain phosphatidylcholines (PCs), a class of phospholipids, would correlate with a greater capacity to produce MCFAs, which are shorter in length than the abundant fatty acids commonly found in S. cerevisiae.\n\nTo validate that hypothesis, U of I scientists compared the MALDI-ToF MS profile of the naturally occurring yeast with two genetically engineered strains previously found to produce higher levels of MCFAs. The data showed that these two mutants had more of the shorter acyl chain PCs than the naturally occurring yeast. Those preliminary findings were then confirmed by the more exact liquid chromatography and fragment mass spectrometry processes.\n\nadvertisement\n\nWith their established screening method in hand, CABBI team members set out to find more mutant strains with higher production of MCFAs. They found two prominent peaks on the mass spectrum that were correlated with the phospholipids, an indication of fatty acids. Those were then used as a sign of MCFA production.\n\nAs Sweedler points out, \"the mass spectrometry measurement is fast -- analyzing up to 2,000 yeast colonies per hour (approximately one sample every two seconds) compared to 30 minutes per sample under traditional methods.\" The processing time is also significantly shortened: two to three minutes vs. three to four hours per sample. Overall, the MALDI-ToF MS screening tool allows scientists to quickly identify strains that warrant more detailed analysis.\n\n\"Our method allows us to screen tons of mutants in a short time. We can identify the good candidates for further study,\" Xue said.\n\nIn the future, the method can be modified and used for high-throughput screening of other types of products, such as longer-chain fatty acids or fatty alcohols, saving time and labor.\n\nThe researchers hope to build on their work at CABBI's iBioFAB -- the Illinois Biological Foundry for Advanced Biomanufacturing. Its robotic system can speed up sample preparation and provide faster, more accurate results, helping scale up the project to test many more mutant strains, Xue said. With about 6,000 genes in S. cerevisiae, millions of potential synergistic effects and features could be discovered.\n\nBeyond science, these C6 to C12 fatty acids are important in human health, providing critical nutrients and useful products, such as Omega-3 fatty acids.\n\n\"In the future if we can directly generate biofuels and bioproducts such as fatty acids from microbial cells like yeast in large scale, that means we don't need to use petrol,\" Xue said. \"We can save the environment and save a lot of money as well.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519140412.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:04:12", "title": "Galactic cosmic rays now available for study on Earth", "text": "To better understand and mitigate the health risks faced by astronauts from exposure to space radiation, we ideally need to be able to test the effects of Galactic Cosmic Rays (GCRs) here on Earth under laboratory conditions. An article publishing on May 19, 2020 in the open access journal PLOS Biology from Lisa Simonsen and colleagues at the NASA Langley Research Center, USA, describes how NASA has developed a ground-based GCR Simulator at the NASA Space Radiation Laboratory (NSRL), located at Brookhaven National Laboratory.\n\nGalactic cosmic rays comprise a mixture of highly energetic protons, helium ions, and higher charge and energy ions ranging from lithium to iron, and they are extremely difficult to shield against. These ions interact with spacecraft materials and human tissues to create a complex mixed field of primary and secondary particles.\n\nThe biological effects from these heavy ions and mixtures of ions are poorly understood. Using recently developed fast beam switching and controls systems technology, NSRL demonstrated the ability to rapidly and repeatedly switch between multiple ion-energy beam combinations within a short period of time, while accurately controlling the extremely small daily doses delivered by the heavier ions.\n\nThe authors describe how the simulator was developed, with a view to balancing the definition of mission-relevant radiation environments, facility limitations and beam selection, required hardware and software upgrades, as well as animal care and handling constraints.\n\nIn June of 2018, thirty-three unique ion-energy beam combinations were delivered in rapid sequential order (under 75 minutes), cumulatively mimicking the GCR environment experienced by shielded astronauts on a deep space mission. The following October, acute and highly fractionated GCR simulation doses were delivered to three animal model systems over four weeks to investigate mixed-field quality and dose-rate effects on the risks of radiogenic cancers, cardiovascular disease, and adverse effects on the central nervous system.\n\nOver the past 30 years, most research on understanding space radiation-induced health risks has been performed using acute exposures of mono-energetic single-ion beams. Now a mixed field of ions can be studied collectively in the same animal cohort, thereby drastically reducing the number of animals, husbandry, and research costs. This achievement marks a significant step forward and enables a new era of radiobiology research to accelerate our understanding and mitigation of health risks faced by astronauts during long duration exploration missions or interplanetary travel to Mars.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519140407.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:04:07", "title": "Lab engineers 3D-functional bone tissues", "text": "Dr. Akhilesh K. Gaharwar, associate professor, has developed a highly printable bioink as a platform to generate anatomical-scale functional tissues. This study was recently published in the American Chemical Society's Applied Materials and Interfaces.\n\nBioprinting is an emerging additive manufacturing approach that takes biomaterials such as hydrogels and combines them with cells and growth factors, which are then printed to create tissue-like structures that imitate natural tissues.\n\nOne application of this technology could be designing patient-specific bone grafts, an area that is gaining interest from researchers and clinicians. Managing bone defects and injuries through traditional treatments tends to be slow and expensive. Gaharwar said that developing replacement bone tissues could create exciting new treatments for patients suffering from arthritis, bone fractures, dental infections and craniofacial defects.\n\nBioprinting requires cell-laden biomaterials that can flow through a nozzle like a liquid, but solidify almost as soon as they're deposited. These bioinks need to act as both cell carriers and structural components, requiring them to be highly printable while providing a robust and cell?friendly microenvironment. However, current bioinks lack sufficient biocompatibility, printability, structural stability and tissue?specific functions needed to translate this technology to preclinical and clinal applications.\n\nTo address this issue, Gaharwar's research group is leading efforts in developing advanced bioinks known as Nanoengineered Ionic-Covalent Entanglement (NICE) bioinks. NICE bioinks are a combination of two reinforcement techniques (nonreinforcement and ionic-covalent network), which together provide more effective reinforcement that results in much stronger structures.\n\nOnce bioprinting is complete, the cell-laden NICE networks are crosslinked to form stronger scaffolds. This technique has allowed the lab to produce full-scale, cell-friendly reconstructions of human body parts, including ears, blood vessels, cartilage and even bone segments.\n\nSoon after the bioprinting, the enclosed cells start depositing new proteins rich in a cartilage-like extracellular matrix that subsequently calcifies to form a mineralized bone over a three-month period. Almost 5 percent of these printed scaffolds consisted of calcium, which is similar to cancellous bone, the network of spongy tissue typically found in vertebral bones.\n\nTo understand how these bioprinted structures induce stem cell differentiation, a next-generation genomics technique called whole transcriptome sequencing (RNA-seq) was utilized. RNA-seq takes a snapshot of all genetic communication inside the cell at given moment. The team worked with Dr. Irtisha Singh from Texas A&M Health Science Center, who served as a co-investigator.\n\n\"The next milestone in 3D bioprinting is the maturation of bioprinted constructs toward the generation of functional tissues,\" Gaharwar said. \"Our study demonstrates that NICE bioink developed in our lab can be used to engineer 3D-functional bone tissues.\"\n\nIn the future, Gaharwar's team plans to demonstrate in vivo functionality of the 3D-bioprinted bone tissue.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519140405.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:04:05", "title": "Combined production of fish and vegetables can be profitable", "text": "When it comes to future food production, the combined farming of fish and vegetables through aquaponics is currently a hotly debated topic. But how realistic is the idea? Publicly available data and analysis on the economic feasibility of professional aquaponics are at present very limited. Researchers from the Leibniz-Institute of Freshwater Ecology and Inland Fisheries (IGB) have just published an extensive profitability analysis of a facility that already produces fish and vegetables on a large scale. The result: aquaponics may have both environmental and cost benefits -- if produced according to good agricultural practice and under suitable conditions.\n\nThe subject of analysis was the aquaponic system of the \"Mueritzfischer,\" located in Waren (Mueritz). This 540 square metre facility produces fish and vegetables in a combined recirculating system. The aquaponic system was built within \"INAPRO,\" an EU-funded project led by IGB.\n\nThe researchers carried out extensive analysis based on real one-year production data. Although the aquaponic system was not profitable at the research stage, the very extensive and valuable set of data it produced enabled the researchers to develop two scenarios for production practice. One scenario showed that the aquaponics approach is profitable if facilities are sufficiently large. On the basis of this scenario, the scientists developed a model case with defined economic key indicators, enabling them to calculate the figures for different sized facilities.\n\n\"It is a good thing that there is a social, political and economic interest in aquaponics as a future technology. The aim of our study is to offer a research-based contribution to this debate, pointing out the opportunities and the challenges involved. This is one of the reasons why we decided to publish our findings cost-free, in open access format,\" explained Professor Werner Kloas, leader of the project.\n\nAccording to the IGB researchers, the main obstacles for commercial aquaponics are the high investment costs and, especially in Germany, the high operating costs such as for fish feed, labour and energy. They also state that undertakings must have the necessary expertise in both aquaculture and horticulture. Furthermore, the margin reportedly depends to a considerable extent on the market environment and the production risks, which are very difficult to forecast in some cases.\n\nUrban farming: aquaponics in the city\n\nThe lead author of the study, Goesta Baganz, sees great potential in the system, despite the risks. Citing the example of urban spaces, he stated: \"The already profitable model case would cover an overall space of about 2,000 square metres. This would mean that professional aquaponics would also be possible in urban and peri-urban areas, where space is scarce and often relatively expensive. If, therefore, urban aquaponics can make a profit on such a scale, there is even greater opportunity for local food production, which is becoming increasingly important throughout the world as urbanisation progresses.\"\n\n\"Considering current problems like climate change, population growth, urbanisation as well as overexploitation and pollution of natural resources, global food production is the largest pressure caused by humans on Earth, threatening ecosystems and the stability of societies. Consequently, one of the key societal goals is to achieve eco-friendly, efficient food production,\" explained Werner Kloas, putting aquaponics research into the global context.\n\nHow IGB aquaponics -- known also as \"Tomatofish\" -- works:\n\nA wide range of aquaponics approaches exist, many of which originated from amateur settings. The approach developed by IGB researchers is based on two recirculating systems in which fish and plants are produced in separate units. Smart software and sensors continuously take measurements and interconnect the two cycles, whenever needed, to make optimum use of synergies, whilst still creating the best growth conditions for both units.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200519140401.htm", "published": "2020-05-19T19:04:01", "title": "Emerging viral diseases causing serious issues in west Africa: Viruses causing illnesses, including adverse birth outcomes and death", "text": "In a new study, researchers from the Colorado School of Public Health at the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus call attention to the emergence of mosquito-borne viral outbreaks in West Africa, such as dengue (DENV), chikungunya (CHIKV) and Zika (ZIKV) viruses.\n\nThe findings are published in the current issue of Acta Tropica.\n\n\"Emerging viruses are at the forefront of everyone's attention due to the COVID-19 pandemic.

Despite numerous indications, there has not yet been any clear evidence to support which brain areas process these abilities. A study has now succeeded in identifying the crucial region -- with the help of a unique patient and the not-so-rare dys-executive syndrome.\n\nFor our social life and our profession we must be able to deal with our environment and other people. Executive functions, meaning the basic intellectual abilities that control human thought and action, help us to do this. These include selective attention, otherwise known as the ability to concentrate on one stimulus and suppress others, or the working memory, with which we can retain and manipulate information. These functions also enable us to plan actions and to divide them into individual steps.\n\nHowever, some people do not succeed, finding it difficult to focus, plan their actions in a goal-oriented manner, and they have poor control over their impulses and emotions. They suffer from a condition called dysexecutive syndrome, which is often caused by craniocerebral trauma or a stroke.\n\nOne of those affected is a 56-year-old patient from Leipzig. She had suffered several strokes that hit a strategically very important region of the brain: The so-called inferior frontal junction area (IFJ) in the frontal lobe of the cerebral cortex in both hemispheres. The injury meant she was no longer able to pass basic psychological tests. These include, for example, the planning task zoo visit, in which a person is required to plan a tour of a zoo in accordance with various guidelines, or the Stroop test, which measures how well someone can suppress disturbing, unimportant stimuli in order to concentrate on an actual task.\n\nThe special feature of the examined patient: The lesion was limited to the IFJ alone, in both hemispheres of the brain equally. Normally, a stroke injures larger areas of the brain or is not restricted to such a defined area. In addition, it rarely affects the homologous areas in both hemispheres of the brain at the same time. As difficult as the situation is for the patient, it offers a unique opportunity for science to investigate the role of this region for executive functions.\n\n\"From functional MRI examinations on healthy persons, it was already known that the IFJ is increasingly activated when selective attention, working memory and the other executive functions are required. However, the final proof that these executive abilities are located there has not yet been provided,\" explains Matthias Schroeter, first author of the underlying study and head of the research group \"Cognitive Neuropsychiatry\" at MPI CBS. However, causal evidence of such functional-anatomical relationships can only be obtained when the areas are actually switched off -- and thus the abilities actually located there fail. \"We were able to provide this proof with the help of this patient.\"\n\nAnd not only that; in addition to the classic approach -- assigning individual functions to a specific brain region on the basis of brain damage and the corresponding impairments -- the researchers also took the opposite approach: the \"big data\" approach via databases. These portals contain information from tens of thousands of participants from many psychological tests and the brain areas activated in the process. With their help, the researchers were able to predict the patient's impairments solely on the basis of the brain damage determined by brain scans. Experts refer to this as symptom reading, a method which could be used in the future to adapt a therapy to individual patients and their brain damage without having to test it in detail.\n\n\"If patients suffer from a loss of executive functions after an accident or stroke, for example, they are usually less able to regenerate the other affected abilities because they find it difficult to plan for them,\" said Schroeter. \"In future, when the lesion images and databases provide us with more detailed information on which regions, and hence abilities, have failed, we will be able to adapt the therapy even more specifically.", "author": []}]}, "economist_business": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/business-finance/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/business", "articles": []}, "economist_science_and_tech": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/science-technology/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/science", "articles": []}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/coronavirus-deaths/", "published": "2020-05-20T11:00:27", "title": "The Uncounted Dead", "text": "The first time Bob Duffy entered the world of epidemiology, he was an amateur scientist.

She was studying the ecology and evolution of infectious diseases, using tiny lake crustaceans as a model organism.\n\nTogether, Meghan and Bob would go out in a truck, towing a little, flat-bottomed rowboat. They were studying how epidemics begin and spread under a variety of conditions. They\u2019d unhitch at one lake, and then another, working their way across the countryside as they collected and counted diseased crustaceans and the fish that preyed on them. \u201cOver the course of a few months, you can go through a whole epidemic,\u201d Meghan Duffy told me. Her father was her paid research assistant, and one of his jobs was to catch the fish.

He never got tested \u2014 he didn\u2019t want to enter a hospital and be separated from Fran, his wife of 48 years.\n\nInstead, because he didn\u2019t die at a hospital and because this was at the beginning of the pandemic, when guidelines were rapidly changing and testing was hard to come by, Bob Duffy became one of the people who fell through the statistical cracks. As of this writing, 22,843 New Yorkers have officially died from COVID-19. Bob Duffy is not counted among them.\n\nMore than a month later, the question of who counts as a COVID-19 fatality has become political. In Florida, the Medical Examiners Commission accused state officials of suppressing their state death count. Pennsylvania\u2019s death tally bounced up and down, enough to prompt the state senate to discuss giving coroners a bigger role in investigating COVID-19 deaths. And President Trump has questioned the official national death count of 90,340 as of May 19, reportedly wondering whether it was exaggerated.\n\nThe experts who are involved in counting novel coronavirus deaths at all levels \u2014 from local hospitals to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention \u2014 disagree with the president. If anything, they say, these deaths are undercounted. And with a death like Bob Duffy\u2019s, you can begin to see why.\n\nBob was a person, beloved by his family and his community. Ever since he died, Bob has also become a number \u2014 data entered into a spreadsheet, just like the tiny shellfish he and his daughter once pulled from cold Michigan lakes. His death might never end up being attributed to SARS-CoV-2, but his death matters to the way we understand it.\n\nThere was never a cough. Instead, the first sign of illness Fran Duffy remembers was when she and Bob tried to go for a walk and he couldn\u2019t make it to the end of the block. \u201cWe got three houses down, and he said, \u2018I can\u2019t walk today. I\u2019m too tired.\u2019 I thought maybe he\u2019s getting a bug. Maybe he\u2019s just tired. So we came back. That was Wednesday,\u201d she said.\n\nHe died four days later.\n\nIt was a very fast decline. But in other ways, Bob\u2019s final illness was just part of a long string of sicknesses. Over the two decades since his retirement, he had had a stroke. He also had had cancer in his mouth, colon and liver. There was scarring \u2014 fibrosis \u2014 that had damaged his lungs and forced him onto supplemental oxygen. The radiation treatments that had cured his cancers years ago had also left him with nerve damage in his legs and a slowly eroding jawbone. Bob was not the picture of health. We are, after all, talking about a guy who worked for the NYFD during a time when firefighters did not routinely wear the ventilators and masks they had been issued. It was a macho thing, Fran said. You couldn\u2019t be the one guy who put on the mask if nobody else did.\n\nSo when Bob got sick in late March this year, whatever it was was not the only thing he was sick with. He was also so sick of being sick that he wasn\u2019t interested in going to the hospital. Even as his temperature soared to 103 degrees, Bob chose to do a video chat with his family doctor, Ihor Magun, rather than leave the house. Fran remembers the doctor suggesting they treat Bob as if he was positive for COVID-19, in terms of isolation from friends and family. He could have gotten a test \u2014 but the nearest testing center at Jones Beach was 30 minutes away, and then there were the long lines besides. Fran thought about driving him out there, but he was already sick enough that that option seemed worse for him than not knowing what it was that he had contracted.\n\nAll those small decisions, made in the moment because of what was best for Bob, ended up determining how his death was recorded.\n\nThe way deaths are counted, like so much else in the U.S., differs among (and even within) states. There\u2019s a lot of variation in this process, even on a good day \u2014 a fact that stretches all the way back to the beginning of mortality records in this country. While the census began counting living people nationwide in 1790, recording deaths was left up to state and local governments. The first state to fully document its deaths was Massachusetts, in 1842. It wasn\u2019t until 1933 that all states were turning in death counts to federal authorities.\n\nEven today, now that the death certificate itself is fairly standardized, who first records your death and decides what you died of varies by where you live and where you die. And that variation is only likely to increase when people begin dying of a new disease that we still don\u2019t understand. In Milwaukee County, Wisconsin, for example, medical examiners \u2014 medical doctors who investigate deaths and perform autopsies \u2014 must provide official certification for every COVID-19 or COVID-19-related death in the county, said Dr. Sally Aiken, president of the National Association of Medical Examiners. But that\u2019s not true everywhere. In New York State, medical examiners get involved only in cases that seem strange or suspicious, like when an otherwise healthy young person dies with no prior warning, said Richard Sullivan, president of the New York State Funeral Directors Association. Otherwise, the decision is left up to health care workers.\n\nBob\u2019s death certificate was filled out by his family doctor and did not mention COVID-19. The county medical examiner called Fran but asked only about Bob\u2019s preexisting conditions. He had had enough of them that there was no reason to suspect foul play, and that was all the medical examiner needed to know.\n\nIf Bob had died in a nearby hospital, such as one of the ones in Nassau County owned by Northwell Health, he would have been tested for COVID-19, either before or after his death. Whether he\u2019d been there for five minutes or a month, hospital staff would have been in charge of filling out the part of his electronic death record that pertains to cause of death, a representative from Northwell told me. This process can look deceptively simple \u2014 just write a cause of death on the line \u2014 but there\u2019s more to it than you\u2019d think.\n\nThe New York electronic death records form provides three lines for cause of death, which are supposed to be filled out in a way that tells a story. The idea is that nobody ever really dies of just one thing, Aiken told me. Even if you die in a traffic accident, the death record might read something like \u201cBlunt force trauma \u2026 as a consequence of a car crash.\u201d This is the information that helps people further up the data chain classify a death accurately. Leaving any part of the story out means a gap in the data later.\n\nNot everyone fills out these records completely, though. And early on during the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a lot of confusion happening, said Shawna Webster, executive director of the National Association for Public Health Statistics and Information Systems, which represents vital registrars nationwide. \u201cIt might just say \u2018coronavirus,\u2019 which I\u2019m sure you know is not as descriptive as it needs to be,\u201d she said. There are, after all, multiple ways COVID-19 might kill a person. On the other end of the spectrum are people who fill out the forms completely wrong. \u201cPlease do not put \u2018COVID-19 test negative,'\u201d Webster said. \u201cDo not do that. There were several.\u201d\n\nIn the days after his first symptoms, Bob\u2019s condition worsened. He\u2019d become so tired he couldn\u2019t leave the house \u2014 then so tired that walking anywhere by himself was impossible. He had a massively high fever. But even Saturday, the night before he died, he was still talking, Fran said, and so she asked him what he wanted for dinner. She expected something light. Bob said, \u201cCorned beef hash.\u201d\n\n\u201cI said, \u2018Bob, corned beef hash?'\u201d But he was sure. So Fran put it together for him, the man she loved. She had to move him to a wheelchair and bring him to the kitchen to eat. He could no longer walk without falling. \u201cI bring him to the kitchen and I\u2019m just turning to the sink to wash my hands and I hear plop,\u201d she said. He had fallen asleep at the table. \u201cHis head went right down in the plate. And I just said, \u2018Bob. What about the corned beef hash!\u2019 So it just \u2026 he thought about it and he wanted it, but he just couldn\u2019t get it, you know?\u201d\n\nDoctors say this kind of oxygen depletion and exhaustion \u2014 coupled with an ability to still communicate \u2014 is a common feature of COVID-19. Even after he collapsed at the table, Bob was lucid enough to talk to the priest who gave him his last rites later that night. He died the next day.\n\nOver the next few weeks, it would become clear that Bob had been in contact with a number of potential sources of COVID-19 \u2014 or maybe he\u2019d been a source that passed it to them. It\u2019s impossible to know. His son-in-law was later diagnosed with the disease, and his wife \u2014 one of Bob\u2019s three daughters \u2014 tested positive for COVID-19 antibodies. One day Fran would open the newspaper to find that the woman who had cut her and Bob\u2019s hair for three decades \u2014 and who had come to their house just before Bob got sick \u2014 had died of COVID-19.\n\nBut Bob\u2019s death certificate makes no mention of the novel coronavirus. Bob\u2019s doctor did not return requests for an interview, so we don\u2019t know why he made the choices he did when completing the certificate. But Bob\u2019s immediate cause of death is listed as \u201ccardiopulmonary arrest\u201d \u2014 his heart stopped \u2014 as a consequence of \u201cchronic obstructive lung disease,\u201d as a consequence of \u201cfibrosis.\u201d\n\nBob is a prime example of why doctors and other experts think that COVID-19 deaths are probably being undercounted \u2014 not overcounted, as some COVID-19 skeptics have alleged. In fact, if Bob had died today, there\u2019s a decent chance that he\u2019d have been labeled a \u201cprobable\u201d COVID death, based on current CDC guidelines, which, among other things, advise doctors to include \u201cprobable COVID-19\u201d on death certificates when a patient has had symptoms of the disease and been in contact with people who tested positive. Originally, only people who themselves had tested positive for the virus were being counted. Like Bob, a lot of people were probably left out. But even as the guidelines were revised and the national death count \u2014 which includes probable as well as confirmed cases \u2014 shot upward, experts said that undercounting was still more likely than overcounting.\n\nSome of this reasoning is based on logic. We know that we had a widespread shortage of tests when people were already dying of COVID-19, so it makes sense that these two problems would overlap at times.\n\nOther reasoning is based on data. In a lot of states the number of pneumonia deaths in March was higher than what you\u2019d expect for that time of year, or for the level of influenza active during that time \u2014 an important detail, given that pneumonia can often be a complication of that disease as well. These increases were particularly noticeable in New Jersey, Georgia, Illinois, Washington and New York, according to research led by Dan Weinberger, a professor of epidemiology at Yale School of Medicine. But pneumonia isn\u2019t the only way COVID-19 kills. All deaths in the state of New York went up in March, and these excess deaths \u2014 deaths above the usual rate for that place and time of year \u2014 outstrip diagnosed COVID-19 cases statewide by nearly three times. Data collected by The New York Times suggests that the high number of \u201cexcess\u201d deaths in New York continued through April.\n\nYet another reason why experts say we\u2019re not overcounting COVID-19 deaths is that we\u2019re now counting them in much the same way as we have always counted deaths from infectious disease. The methodology is longstanding and is used for all sorts of diseases \u2014 and there\u2019s never been cause to think that the methodology made us overcount the deaths from those other diseases.\n\nIn the bureaucracy of death everything happens fast, fast, fast, and then, after a while, things just grind on.\n\nIf you look at the CDC\u2019s annual report of flu deaths, for example, you\u2019ll see that it\u2019s \u201cestimated,\u201d modeled on official flu deaths reported, deaths from flu-like causes reported, and what we know about flu epidemiology. The calculation is done this way precisely because public health officials know that a straight count of formally diagnosed flu deaths would be an undercount of actual flu deaths.\n\nWhile flu tests aren\u2019t in short supply and essentially anyone who wants to be tested for the flu can be, not everyone who catches it gets tested. Plenty of people get sick with the flu and never go to a doctor, said Alberto Marino, a research officer at the London School of Economics who has studied disease case and death counts for both LSE and the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development. If they die \u2014 especially if they are also old or have some underlying condition \u2014 the role the flu played in their deaths can easily go unnoticed and unrecorded. We don\u2019t record \u201cprobable\u201d flu deaths (again, the tests aren\u2019t rationed), but we do record deaths due to \u201cflu-like illnesses\u201d \u2014 and plenty of people who die from the flu don\u2019t have that listed as the cause on their death certificates.\n\nLikewise, when a doctor lists COVID-19 as a condition that led to someone\u2019s death \u2014 even if it was just the last in a series of illnesses \u2014 they\u2019re not doing anything different from what\u2019s been done with the flu for years, Aiken told me.\n\nBasically, if you think COVID-19 deaths are being inflated, then you shouldn\u2019t trust annual flu death counts, either. Or a whole host of other death counts. The only reason to really think that COVID-19 death counts are less trustworthy at this point is that the flu is politically neutral while the new coronavirus is not.\n\nIf there\u2019s any major difference between the way we count flu deaths and the way we count COVID-19 deaths, it\u2019s that nobody is trying to publish flu deaths daily, in real time. And that\u2019s where death counting for COVID-19 gets complicated.\n\nWhen Bob Duffy died, his community responded immediately. Fran found her mailbox filled with cards; flowers and baked goods piled up on the porch. At one point, there were so many tulips, hydrangeas and pansies that the Amazon delivery guy started to make comments, so Fran decided to plant the flowers around the yard. \u201cThere\u2019s not one card that doesn\u2019t have a separate letter in it,\u201d she said. And many were from people she didn\u2019t even know.\n\nBesides being a firefighter and Ph.D. assistant, Bob spent many years working with the local Catholic parish\u2019s social ministry. Essentially, he was a volunteer social worker. He made sure people who were hungry found meals. He helped strangers pay their utility bills, and he coordinated a Long Island-wide food bank. \u201cMost people volunteer one day a week. Bob officially volunteered five days a week,\u201d Fran told me. \u201cHe ended up with the keys to the parish. He was up there seven days a week, and he couldn\u2019t be stopped.\u201d\n\nSo when he did stop, people cared. And they cared for his widow.\n\nDeath happens suddenly, abruptly. At first, family, friends and, sometimes, if we\u2019re lucky, strangers burst into action like Roman candles, sending out showers of casseroles and condolences like sparks. For a short period of time, there is a lot to do, decisions to be made, love to be accepted. But then there is quiet. And then there is the rest of your life. The absence that death leaves behind lasts far longer than the initial flurry of condolences.\n\nThe bureaucracy of death has a similar dynamic \u2014 first, everything happens fast, fast, fast, and then, after a while, things just grind on.\n\nIn New York, in the heady first day or two after a person dies, the doctor or hospital enters the cause of death on an electronic death record, the funeral home fills out demographic data on the same form, and the state registrar of vital statistics logs the data. But from there things slow down considerably.\n\nUsually, that\u2019s fine \u2014 death statistics aren\u2019t so volatile that we need them to be updated as quickly as, say, election returns or live sports scores. But the pandemic has changed our relationship with these stats. Now they\u2019re how we know whether we\u2019re stopping the spread of COVID-19, and just how big that spread is. The problem is that the system isn\u2019t designed to do that work.\n\nNormally, if a death is uncomplicated and requires no investigation or autopsy or debate, death records are transferred to the National Center for Health Statistics, an arm of the CDC that organizes and analyzes the data of life and death in this country. It\u2019s here that a death is categorized and tabulated. And this process is happening now, with COVID-19 deaths as well.\n\nIt takes time to investigate some of the deaths and get them to NCHS \u2014 the frequency of investigations varies widely, but state-level emergency operations teams work with medical personnel and state epidemiology surveillance to review COVID-19 deaths and possible COVID-19 deaths, Webster said. So the records can be in the state databases for a while before they\u2019re solid enough that they go to NCHS. Then, someone at the NCHS is reading each of these death records to make sure that, say, a car crash victim who happened to have a COVID-19 diagnosis is logged in a database differently from a COVID-19-positive patient who died on a ventilator. The result of all this is that, even though public counts include confirmed COVID-19 deaths and probable ones, the deaths aren\u2019t just being recorded willy-nilly. And it will be possible, in the future, to go back and look at the records and see which cases were confirmed by testing and which weren\u2019t.\n\nBut these are slow stats. And they\u2019re slowed down even further by the confusion caused by a novel virus pandemic. Currently, the count of COVID-19 deaths produced this way is at least two weeks behind, said Robert Anderson, chief of the mortality statistics branch of the NCHS. The counts in some states, including New York, might be lagging even more. This system is the gold standard, Webster said, but it\u2019s designed to produce accurate statistics \u2014 not monitor a pandemic in real time.\n\nDeath is hard \u2014 hard to count, hard to experience.\n\nAnd so the CDC also has fast stats on COVID-19 deaths. Besides going to the NCHS, the data from the New York State vital records office is also gathered directly from that agency\u2019s database and into one maintained by USAFacts, a nonpartisan nonprofit organization charged with collecting daily death reports from the state and county registrars that first record them. The CDC\u2019s COVID Data Tracker comes directly from the USAFacts count.\n\nThat means there are two distinct death counts being published by the CDC \u2014 one slow, one fast. (That\u2019s in addition to counts being kept by Johns Hopkins University, The New York Times, and other entities.) As of May 19, the CDC\u2019s slow count was 67,008, and its fast count was 90,340. You\u2019ll find both counts in various sections of the CDC\u2019s website, and when you look at those pages, it\u2019s not always clear what these separate counts do and don\u2019t represent. It\u2019s easy to get confused and assume that the death count you\u2019ve just seen in the newspaper has suddenly been cut in half. On May 2, conservative firebrand Dinesh D\u2019Souza falsely claimed exactly that, linking his followers to the CDC\u2019s slow count.\n\nThe smaller, slow count is more accurate, but it doesn\u2019t reflect how many people have died as of today. It\u2019s weeks behind. The fast count does a better job of portraying the real-time situation, but the exact number will shift as state and local counts fluctuate. Some of that change is due to confusion between state and local entities. New York City, for example, has its own vital records office \u2014 almost as though it\u2019s an independent state \u2014 and the fast-count numbers it produces for itself don\u2019t usually match the fast-count numbers produced for it by the State of New York, said Tanveer Ali, a data visualization analyst for USAFacts.\n\nAnd while Bob Duffy will not be counted in either the slow or the fast counts happening now, he will likely end up included in the data \u2014 if only by algorithmic proxy. Eventually, experts said, the CDC will come back and do an estimated burden of death counts for COVID-19, just as it does for the flu every year.\n\nAll of this is why we won\u2019t know the exact number of people who died of COVID-19 for years, Aiken said. Again, that\u2019s nothing new. Final estimates for the number of people who died in the 2009 H1N1 pandemic weren\u2019t published until 2011. Getting the slow count right, sorting through differences between disparate and nonstandardized state reporting systems, correcting errors and categorizing probable cases, finding ways to understand how many Bob Duffys we\u2019re missing \u2014 it all takes time. This is, experts emphasized again and again, something nobody has ever done before. But the precedent that does exist suggests we shouldn\u2019t expect to get a \u201cright\u201d answer soon. \u201cIf you look at opioid mortality, they\u2019re two and a half years behind on compiling that,\u201d Aiken said.\n\nDeath is hard \u2014 hard to count, hard to experience. The personal and the statistical both reside in a space where the question of \u201cwhat happened\u201d can be answered as an absolute \u2014 as certain as we can ever be about a thing \u2014 while simultaneously remaining painfully inexact and mysterious.\n\nWe will almost certainly never know exactly how many Americans died of COVID-19. But any count we get by leaving out deaths probably related to the virus \u2014 and, ultimately, leaving out Bob and a lot of people like him \u2014 will be less accurate than a count that includes them.\n\n\u201cWe like to have answers. We like to have a yes, a no, a definite answer,\u201d Fran said. Bob had been dead for about a month when Fran spoke to me from her kitchen. Just that day, someone she didn\u2019t know had sympathetically left a loaf of banana bread in her mailbox. He was still so close. He was so far away. \u201cBut we certainly don\u2019t always get what we like,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s really the truth, you know?\u201d\n\nAdditional reporting by Kaleigh Rogers.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-is-president-trump-taking-hydroxychloroquine/", "published": "2020-05-19T20:02:52", "title": "Why Is President Trump Taking Hydroxychloroquine?", "text": "cwick (Chadwick Matlin, deputy editor): Clare, Kaleigh and Maggie, thanks for joining me to talk about the president\u2019s medicine cabinet. Yesterday, President Trump revealed that he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine, an anti-malarial medication, to help prevent him from contracting COVID-19. Trump\u2019s comments were the culmination of his interest in the drug, which he has hyped for months as a way to help fight the pandemic. Let\u2019s talk about what the science says about hydroxychloroquine, what Trump has said about it, and what it says about Trump that he\u2019s taking it.\n\nTrump says he\u2019s taking hydroxychloroquine\n\nSo, let\u2019s start with the science, which is about the only thing that can ground us in this frenzied moment. Can hydroxychloroquine prevent someone from getting COVID-19?\n\nclare.malone (Clare Malone, senior political writer): (Readers can, on their own time, imagine what else is in the president\u2019s gold-plated medicine cabinet.)\n\nmaggie (Maggie Koerth, senior science writer): What we\u2019re basically looking at here is a massive lack of evidence for anything, Chad.\n\nkaleigh (Kaleigh Rogers, science and politics reporter): The results from the few studies that have been done are mixed, at best. Some have found hydroxychloroquine reduced the duration of COVID-19, others have found no difference between using the drug and not, and at least one found there was actually a worse outcome for patients who were on hydroxychloroquine versus those who were not.\n\nmaggie: There are ongoing studies of better quality happening \u2014 I\u2019m particularly interested in one that\u2019s looking at COVID-19 incidence and outcomes in lupus patients who were already taking hydroxychloroquine for their chronic illness \u2014 but we just don\u2019t have evidence to say it does anything.\n\nkaleigh: We do know from past trials of hydroxychloroquine that it can cause abnormal heart rhythms, so the president\u2019s claim that there\u2019s no harm in trying it is not based on evidence. This isn\u2019t like taking vitamin C.\n\ncwick: And are these all studies that test for whether hydroxychloroquine prevents COVID-19? Or are they testing whether it improves treatment of the disease?\n\nkaleigh: Most trials I\u2019ve seen are to treat COVID-19, not to prevent it. (Though there is at least one trial currently testing it out for preventive use.)\n\ncwick: So Trump\u2019s decision to take it preventively complicates things further. We\u2019re in the dearth-iest corner of the dearth of evidence.\n\nmaggie: You have the science side of things, which is mostly proceeding as it ought to, and you have the political side, which is full of hype and boom-or-bust demand.\n\ncwick: With that said, Clare, why is Trump doing this? Or maybe the better question: Why is Trump telling us he\u2019s doing it?\n\nclare.malone: On a personal level, Trump is likely taking it because of the recent infections of White House staff and because, well, as we all know, he\u2019s a germaphobe!\n\nBut I think it\u2019s a piece of his public response to the outbreak. He attempted, in a quite pitched way at first, to convince the public that things were not as bad as they were made out to be. He promised a non-entity of a disease at first and compared it to the flu. The idea of taking this drug plays into all that, in a more tamped-down way, because he\u2019s offering the public a sort of \u201ccure\u201d or hope. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a slip of the tongue, but it is a key part of his own thinking about the virus and a key part of how he wants to talk about it in public.\n\ncwick: That\u2019s interesting, Clare. One of the defining characteristics of this disease has been its uncertainty. That\u2019s in part because we haven\u2019t known how to treat those who are sick (let alone make the rest of us immune). Trump seems to be saying: If a medication is good enough to make the president feel safer, it\u2019s good enough to make you feel safer.\n\nmaggie: I\u2019m interested, Clare, in whether we\u2019ve seen presidents get so specific in their hope-peddling before. It seems normal for a president to say, \u201cOh there\u2019s all this research being done and we will have options, let\u2019s fund them.\u201d But it feels to me like Trump has uniquely used the bully pulpit to tout specific products \u2014 hydroxychloroquine, that Abbott Laboratories test \u2014 when there was more than one option out there. And it\u2019s come back to bite him multiple times. Because when science is moving fast, most of the \u201cgood ideas\u201d are going to fail at first. Pinning hope on specific brands and products seems like a real risk he\u2019s taken on.\n\nclare.malone: Right, Chad. The president has gotten A TON of flak for his refusal to wear a mask, but that\u2019s also part of his messaging! It\u2019s certainly odd that he\u2019s taking this drug and not wearing a mask, but he\u2019s a big believer in the sort of traditional displays of \u201cmasculine\u201d strength that American politicians have thought the public likes to see. His no-mask thing is the pandemic equivalent of presidential candidates not wearing winter coats while campaigning in Iowa in January.\n\ncwick: This isn\u2019t about promoting promising research, or the latest trial results. He is, in effect, becoming part of the trial himself.\n\nkaleigh: Except it\u2019s not controlled, randomized or blind, so his \u201ctrial\u201d is scientifically meaningless. I drink coffee every day and haven\u2019t gotten COVID-19 yet \u2014 maybe that\u2019s a prophylactic, too! This is the logic of anecdotal evidence.\n\nmaggie: So this reminds me of the study I saw about how men were significantly less likely than women to take non-pharmaceutical preventive measures in a health crisis, like wearing masks, but were more likely than women to take pharmaceutical measures.\n\nkaleigh: His announcement that he\u2019s taking it certainly felt defiant, like he\u2019s doubling down in spite of the evidence. He also spent some time yesterday criticizing a Veterans Affairs study, which found that patients on hydroxychloroquine actually had a higher risk of death.\n\ncwick: Kaleigh, your point about the VA study is super interesting. We\u2019ve seen how the president can dismiss news and findings that run counter to the narrative he wants to promote, and part of his political struggle during this crisis has been knowing when to embrace the science and when to reject it out of hand. By putting his chips in on one drug, the drug itself becomes a cause to rally behind, and news that disputes its power becomes easier for Trump to critique. Essentially, hydroxychloroquine has become part of the White House policy agenda.\n\nclare.malone: Also, if you\u2019ve eschewed a lot of the science in your initial stages of your response, you might as well bet big on a miracle cure, right? Maybe you\u2019ll be right and people will credit with you being early to the party. Americans do love pharmaceutical solutions to their problems.\n\nShoutout here to former Sen. Bob Dole, the OG American politician-pharmaceuticals spokesman.\n\nkaleigh: It is strange that he got so fixated on this one possible treatment, though. The antiviral drug Remdesivir, by contrast, actually has some promising early results. Why is Trump so interested in hydroxychloroquine? He has scoffed at questions about whether he, say, owns stock in a company that produces the drug, but he also hasn\u2019t provided a lot of explanation about why he\u2019s so fascinated with it.\n\ncwick: Some would have you believe that it might be an issue of cronyism. Here\u2019s the New York Times from April: \u201cSome associates of Mr. Trump\u2019s have financial interests in the issue. Sanofi\u2019s largest shareholders include Fisher Asset Management, the investment company run by Ken Fisher, a major donor to Republicans, including Mr. Trump. A spokesman for Mr. Fisher declined to comment.\u201d\n\nclare.malone: It\u2019s a good question. I\u2019m a bit skeptical of the stock interests answer, since what Trump seems to own is quite negligible. But to Chad\u2019s point, Trump\u2019s personal phone line is always known to be open to friends outside the White House! In the initial stages of the crisis, there\u2019s a sense that he was hesitant to trigger portions of the Defense Production Act because of feedback from the Chamber of Commerce and private industry.\n\nmaggie: And meanwhile, his political advocacy has pushed for millions to be spent on it \u2026 supplies acquired by the VA and the Strategic National Stockpile.\n\nkaleigh: One thing is clear: When Trump touts a treatment, interest goes up. Not only do Google searches soar, but at least one online prescription service reported a nearly six-fold increase in demand for hydroxychloroquine prescriptions after Trump first mentioned the drug.\n\nmaggie: We know there were people from the anti-vaccine movement promoting the so-called \u201dmiracle mineral solution\u201d to him \u2014 a pseudoscience \u201ctreatment\u201d that basically amounts to industrial bleach \u2014 before he spent that one press conference talking about treating yourself with disinfectant.\n\nclare.malone: And we know Trump is susceptible to anti-vaxxers from earlier in his time in public life.\n\nmaggie: I can see why the open phone line thing would work in real estate \u2014 hot backdoor tips from buddies. But that doesn\u2019t really work in science.\n\nclare.malone: But isn\u2019t it more politics masquerading as science? Which might be the whole problem.\n\ncwick: Right, it seems like we\u2019re all arriving at the same terminus: The president has long demonstrated a contrarian approach to science, so his taking hydroxychloroquine despite iffy science is as much about the political as it is about the personal.\n\nkaleigh: What is the political motivation to fixate on one drug and also continue to tout it against all current evidence?\n\nclare.malone: Momentum. You\u2019ve already been saying it: Why stop saying it?! You\u2019ll just look more fallible.\n\ncwick: Politicians don\u2019t like to be wrong.\n\nmaggie: This politician in particular really doesn\u2019t like to be wrong \u2014 maybe even more so than others.\n\nclare.malone: It\u2019s the spin zone, y\u2019all! Hop on in. It\u2019s dark, but that\u2019s what it is.\n\nkaleigh: Right, changing your mind based on new and better information is bad in politics, for some reason.\n\nclare.malone: Flip flopping.\n\ncwick: It\u2019s considered bad in broader society, too!\n\nclare.malone: Is it??

Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.", "text": "Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.\n\nWelcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nSo far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it\u2019s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.\n\nAccording to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, \u201cWe are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,\u201d which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.\n\nThe polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month\u2019s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week\u2019s YouGov/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality \u2014 including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats \u2014 believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.\n\nConcerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.\n\nAnd the share of Americans who say they\u2019re concerned about the virus\u2019s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same \u2014 hovering at around 87 percent \u2014 for the past six weeks.\n\nThe share of Americans who approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he\u2019s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.\n\nAttitudes toward Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however \u2014 according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials\u2019 work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.\n\nHowever, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places \u2014 despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they\u2019re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn\u2019t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nAccording to a Morning Consult/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).\n\n71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later). A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was \u201csomething from nature\u201d or \u201ccreated by people, on purpose,\u201d with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.\n\nHalf of Americans said they would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn\u2019t use such a system, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they\u2019d be likely to use it.\n\nAn SSRS/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.\n\nAccording to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.\n\nGeneric ballot\n\nIn our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).\n\nCheck out all the polls we\u2019ve been collecting ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nCORRECTION (May 15, 2020, 10:01 a.m.): A previous version of this article reversed President Trump\u2019s job approval numbers: 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 52.0 percent disapprove, not the other way around.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does The U.S. Have A Coronavirus Recovery Plan?", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/infectious-disease-experts-think-washington-states-slow-reopening-will-mean-fewer-cases/", "published": "2020-05-14T11:00:20", "title": "Infectious-Disease Experts Think Washington State\u2019s Slow Reopening Will Mean Fewer Cases", "text": "On Wednesday, the total number of COVID-19 cases stood at 1,382,304, with deaths at 78,343. The U.S. is continuing its phased reopening, but states are rolling back restrictions at different rates \u2014 and their residents are out and about to widely varying degrees.\n\nTo investigate the consequences of different approaches, we return to a survey of infectious disease experts organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. For many questions, respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nIn this week\u2019s survey, conducted May 11 and 12, most experts predicted that the total number of positive cases in the U.S. would be more than 1.45 million on May 17. The experts also estimated some measures of the disease in Pennsylvania and Washington, two states with different reopening plans.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported on May 17?\n\nIn recent weeks, the researchers have been given distinct ranges of total confirmed COVID-19 cases and asked to assign a probability to each bin. Last week, the experts nailed their forecast: The expert consensus was that on May 10 there would be between 1.3 million and 1.45 million confirmed positive cases reported by The COVID Tracking Project. The actual number reported on May 10 was 1,322,807.\n\nThis week\u2019s expert consensus puts the most probable range at somewhere between 1.45 and 1.55 million total confirmed cases on May 17. But the expert consensus also assigned a 10 percent probability to a more pessimistic scenario \u2014 one in which there are more than 1.6 million cases.\n\nHow many deaths in Pennsylvania on June 13?\n\nWith the president attempting to pressure Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf into reopening his state more quickly, there is increasing tension between the governor\u2019s three-phase plan and some counties\u2019 desires to open up faster. There have been 58,698 total cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, and the current death toll stands at 3,943. The experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths in the state on June 13. The consensus projection was 7,239 dead, with an 80 percent chance that the actual number will fall between 5,249 and 10,472.\n\nOne expert even believes that the death count could plausibly reach 30,000 in the Keystone State, though that view is not shared by the rest of the panel.\n\nHow many new daily cases in Washington?\n\nEven as it extended its stay-at-home orders through the end of the month, Washington state has begun a four-phase reopening plan that Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s administration is calling \u201cSafe Start.\u201d The state plans to remain in each phase for a minimum of three weeks. The first phase of Safe Start allows for some recreation and construction activity, along with auto sales and commercial pet walking. At the time of the survey, five counties with fewer than 75,000 residents and no new reported cases in the past three weeks were allowed to begin Phase 2, which allows the resumption of activity in restaurants, house cleaning services and hair and nail salons, among other businesses.\n\nThe experts were asked to forecast the average new cases per day in Washington for the first week of June. Their consensus estimate of 332 is in line with case counts near the peak of the outbreak in late March and early April, with an 80 percent chance that the actual daily average will fall between 158 and 644 cases.\n\nExperts were also asked to estimate the average daily case count in the first week of June if all Washington counties were allowed to enter Phase 2 on May 16. They forecast an average of 554 new daily cases under such a plan \u2014 an increase of 67 percent over their estimate of cases under the current plan.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this prediction is that 554 average new daily cases is more than the 441 new cases on March 23, which is thus far the highest number of new cases reported in a single day. Since the experts were asked to predict the average number of new daily cases over the course of a week, they appear quite pessimistic about the effects of an early rollout of Washington\u2019s Phase 2 plan.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/without-a-vaccine-herd-immunity-wont-save-us/", "published": "2020-05-13T10:58:39", "title": "Without A Vaccine, Herd Immunity Won\u2019t Save Us", "text": "Daniel Arlein has already had COVID-19. In March, the 36-year-old small business owner and DJ, who lives in Brooklyn, tested positive for the viral infection and suffered through two weeks of flu-like symptoms.\n\nArlein has since recovered, and while he\u2019s still being careful \u2014 avoiding leaving the house, washing his hands more often and wearing a face mask \u2014 he can\u2019t help feeling a bit relieved to have already had the infection.\n\n\u201cThe only way it\u2019s helping me is psychologically, to be able to go out in the world and still be careful but not be freaked out that I\u2019m going to get sick,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no idea if I will get sick again. I feel like I won\u2019t, but I have no idea if I can get it again.\u201d\n\nMost people understand immunity to mean that once a person has been exposed to a disease, they can\u2019t get it again. It\u2019s an easy concept to grasp, and some people have hoped that widespread immunity could be the way out of this pandemic: If enough of the population becomes immune to the disease, the spread would be stopped, since the virus would run out of new, susceptible targets. The \u201cherd\u201d of immune people would protect everyone.\n\nBut getting to herd immunity without a vaccine isn\u2019t as simple as the idea itself. A number of variables can affect when herd immunity is reached \u2014 and what it costs to get there \u2014 and they vary depending on the disease. How infectious is the disease? How deadly is it? And how long do people stay immune once they\u2019ve gotten it? Adjusting any of these variables can drastically change the outcome of this equation. You can probably sense where this is heading \u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve built a very simplified version of how those variables interact. (You\u2019ll see just how simple in the methodology beneath the simulator.) To be clear, this is not about COVID-19 itself \u2014 instead, our calculator shows how a theoretical disease we\u2019re calling Fictionitis would play out in a population that has never encountered it before and does nothing to try to stop it.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that each variable plays a role in setting a herd immunity threshold and reaching it.\n\nThe more people a person with Fictionitis infects on average, the higher the herd immunity threshold rises, but the faster spread also means that the threshold is reached more quickly. That, of course, can lead to a huge portion of the population getting ill at once, which would overwhelm hospitals. Unless the death rate is extremely low, that would be a devastating mix. A disease that doesn\u2019t spread as readily will stick around for longer, but it helps maintain a flatter curve.\n\nIf you shortened the immunity duration, you may have also seen that the blue bar showing how much of the population is susceptible rose again even after the herd immunity threshold had been crossed. That\u2019s because if immunity fades while the disease is still active, people who were previously immune once again become at risk for infection. Herd immunity only truly works while the recovered population has immunity to the disease.\n\nFor COVID-19, of course, we can\u2019t change these variables, and we still haven\u2019t nailed down their exact values, anyway. What we do know so far paints a stark picture: This disease is too deadly, too contagious and too new to depend on post-infection immunity (as opposed to immunity via vaccination) as a solution. Naturally acquired herd immunity is not the answer.\n\nWhat is herd immunity?\n\nIf everyone in a population is immune to the infection, it can\u2019t spread. But we can prevent a disease\u2019s spread even without everyone being immune. If enough people are immune, the infection is unlikely to spread to big swaths of vulnerable people because those who are immune, the \u201cherd,\u201d protect them. The more people who are immune, the more likely it is that infectious people will only come into contact with people who cannot be infected, ending the spread. This creates a societal barrier between the infectious and the vulnerable.\n\nThe moment when herd immunity kicks in depends on how contagious the pathogen is, which is measured by what experts call the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced \u201cR naught\u201d). The R0 is simply the average number of people an infectious person will spread the disease to in a population where no one is immune, so an R0 of 3 would mean an infected person spreads the disease to, on average, three other people while they\u2019re contagious.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThe higher the R0, the higher the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to stop its spread. This is known as the herd immunity threshold, and the formula for finding it is actually pretty straightforward: 1 \u2013 1/R0. For a really contagious disease like measles, which has an R0 between 12 and 18, 93 to 95 percent of the population needs to be immune to stop the spread (this is why the U.S. has had recent measles outbreaks when vaccination rates dropped even slightly).\n\n\u201cThe higher the proportion in a population that is infected, the fewer places there are for that virus to go, the fewer people are susceptible to being transmitted,\u201d said Greta Bauer, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Western University in Ontario, Canada. \u201cThat makes sense, right? If one person, on average, infects two other people but half the population is immune, they\u2019re only going to be able to infect one other person.\u201d\n\nFor COVID-19, we\u2019re still not certain what the R0 is, so we don\u2019t yet know what the herd immunity threshold is. For now, it\u2019s estimated to be anywhere from 70 to 90 percent. But here\u2019s the problem: To reach even the lower end of that range naturally in the U.S. \u2014 imagine giving up on any interventions and just letting the disease run its course \u2014 230 million Americans would eventually become infected and, depending on the fatality rate (more on that later), millions could die.\n\nAnd reaching herd immunity as the outbreak is raging is a completely different scenario than, for example, doing so after a vaccine has been created. With a vaccine, you can immunize people before they\u2019ve encountered the virus, so by the time the virus gets to a vaccinated population, it has nowhere to spread. But in an active outbreak, even once the herd immunity threshold is reached, the infection keeps going. It takes time for the spread of the disease to crest because, for a while at least, many contagious people will each still infect a small number of vulnerable people, which means even more people will get sick and die. It\u2019s a phenomenon known as \u201covershoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disease sort of stops increasing at the point when you reach herd immunity, but there\u2019s still lots and lots of people infected. It only slowly goes down, and on its way down, [it] infects another third of the population,\u201d said Richard Neher, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \u201cIf you drive a car and suddenly you switch off the engine, it doesn\u2019t stop instantly.\u201d\n\nSo think of crossing the herd immunity threshold as determining the fate of the disease (it\u2019s now bound to die out) rather than its status (it\u2019s dead).\n\nSince the new coronavirus is highly contagious (meaning a large percentage of the population would have to get it to slow its spread), the human toll of reaching herd immunity without a vaccine would be staggering. And that\u2019s assuming that once a person gets sick, they stay immune for a long time. But at this point, we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\n\nHow long are we immune once we\u2019ve had it?\n\nTo reach that herd immunity threshold we either need a vaccine, or we need a lot of people like Arlein who have had the virus and are now immune. Except we don\u2019t actually know if Arlein, or anyone else, is really immune.\n\nTypically, when we encounter a new pathogen, our immune system mounts a defense that includes producing antibodies to fight off the infection. Afterward, some of those antibodies and immune cells hang around, allowing our body to \u201cremember\u201d the offending microbe and more easily fend it off in the future.\n\nMore men than women are dying from COVID-19. Is it biology or behavior? l FiveThirtyEight\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of anything that you or I have been infected with in our lives, our immune system has developed immunity to and remembers,\u201d said Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. \u201cThere are definitely exceptions, but that\u2019s the norm.\u201d\n\nThose exceptions are why experts, including the World Health Organization, can\u2019t presume that having had COVID-19 means you can\u2019t get it again, even though antibodies have been detected in recovered patients.\n\n\u201cThe presence of antibodies, everybody thinks that means immunity, but I study HIV and there\u2019s a huge antibody response to HIV, and it\u2019s never able to neutralize that virus,\u201d Bauer said.\n\nResearchers have begun trying to find out how much protection COVID-19 antibodies give people who\u2019ve recovered from the disease. There\u2019s a chance that the immune response from COVID-19 is enough to prevent someone from getting sick again, but not necessarily from getting infected, which means they could still be contagious to others, according to Crotty.\n\nIt\u2019s likely COVID-19 confers at least some immunity, though. For one, there are no confirmed cases of someone getting COVID-19 twice. Early reports from South Korea drew a lot of attention after patients tested positive for the virus again weeks after having recovered, but researchers later said that dead virus fragments from the original infection likely triggered the positive tests, rather than a second infection. One early study from China \u2014 which has not yet been peer reviewed, so take it with an extra grain of salt \u2014 also measured neutralizing antibodies in 94 percent of patients.\n\nPrevious research done on similar coronaviruses, like the ones that cause SARS and MERS, also offers some promising signs. In a mouse study testing a SARS vaccine, for example, researchers stimulated an immune response that staved off a dose of the virus.\n\nBut why would we fail to become immune to a disease? There are a few things that could be happening. Our bodies could stop short of completely killing off the virus in the first place, allowing it to lie dormant and reemerge later (that\u2019s the case with HIV). The virus could evolve enough that our old antibodies won\u2019t work anymore, whether we got them from natural exposure or a vaccine (this is what the seasonal flu does, and it\u2019s part of why we need a new vaccine every year). Or the immune response we produce could just fade too quickly, making us susceptible to reinfection almost immediately.\n\nWith the new coronavirus, there\u2019s not much evidence that either of the first two scenarios is in play, but the third possibility \u2014 that our immunity fades quickly \u2014 remains an open question, and one we won\u2019t be able to answer until more time has passed. Coronaviruses also cause common colds, after all, and humans seem perpetually susceptible to those. In one oft-cited study, for example, people were given a dose of a cold-causing coronavirus, got sick and recovered, then were given another dose a year later. Most of the patients got reinfected, showing how quickly their immunity waned. (And most of them didn\u2019t get sick, which opens up a whole new barrel of fun: If COVID-19 works the same way, some people who had the disease and recovered could wind up picking up \u2014 and spreading \u2014 the novel coronavirus again despite not being symptomatic.)\n\n\u201cOne reason is because your immune system just doesn\u2019t remember all things equally, and to some extent that memory is tied to how severe the initial infection was,\u201d Crotty said.\n\nThat said, for SARS and MERS, both of which were also caused by coronaviruses, immune memory cells were detected in patients several years after infection, though because those outbreaks have ended, we don\u2019t know if those immune cells would protect against reinfection.\n\nThe only way to know if COVID-19 immunity lasts for, say, 10 years is to wait until a decade has passed and see if anyone who was infected once ever got reinfected. (We\u2019re just full of good news, aren\u2019t we?)\n\nWho\u2019s had it?\n\nEven if it turns out that infected people become immune for some period of time, we still aren\u2019t close to herd immunity solving our COVID-19 problem for us. So few people have had the disease that we\u2019re nowhere near herd immunity yet, and the fatality rate is so high that closing that gap would be devastating.\n\nEventually, reliable serological tests, which detect antibodies, can be administered to large samples of the population. That will give us a better sense of how many people actually had the infection, and thus the disease\u2019s true fatality rate. There was some hope that these serological surveys would reveal the disease was much more widespread \u2014 and therefore way less deadly \u2014 than we thought. If, for example, you have 50 deaths in a community and 1,000 recorded cases, the fatality rate is 5 percent (50 out of 1,000). But if a serological survey of that community later revealed that there were actually 3,000 cases, that fatality rate drops to 1.7 percent.\n\nUnfortunately, early serological surveys suggest the fatality rate isn\u2019t low enough to offer us much comfort.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been 81,507 deaths as of May 12. For a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, the same as the seasonal flu, we\u2019d have to find out that 81.5 million Americans, or nearly a quarter of the U.S. population, had already had COVID-19. But based on early serological surveys, the World Health Organization says it\u2019s likely that only about 2 to 3 percent of the population has been exposed so far.\n\nSome serological surveys have reported wildly different estimates of how many people may be immune. A recent survey in California, for example, found that something like 2 to 4 percent of the population had antibodies, while studies in Germany and Massachusetts found antibodies in 15 to 30 percent of those tested.\n\nOne reason for these huge variations could be that rates are genuinely higher in hotspots. Indeed, in New York, the hardest-hit city on the planet, as much as 21 percent of the population may have already been exposed, according to preliminary results from a serological survey. But if even in New York, less than a quarter of the population has antibodies, it\u2019s pretty unlikely that levels are nearly that high in the rest of the country. And New York has also seen a huge number of deaths: at least more than 19,563 as of May 12. Even if this early estimate is correct and 21 percent of New York\u2019s 8.4 million residents have already been infected, that comes out to 1.8 million people, which still puts the current fatality rate at 1.1 percent, or more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cLooking at what percentage of the population might actually have been infected, the numbers of the cases are much higher and the case fatality rate looks like it might be around half a percent,\u201d said Jeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a trivial number, it\u2019s minuscule.\u2019 But, when you think about, say, the population of the United States, 0.5 percent is a tremendous number, and these are people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe other potential explanation for why those serology survey results are all over the map is there may be problems with the way they were conducted. None of the papers mentioned above have been published in peer-reviewed journals yet, and many experts have raised concerns about false positives and how people were recruited for studies, suggesting even these low levels might be overestimating the true prevalence of the disease.\n\nSo let\u2019s go back to that 70 percent herd immunity threshold. If the fatality rate is around 0.5 percent and 70 percent of Americans have to get sick before their immunity starts protecting others, that means more than 1.1 million people would die. In New York, even having 21 percent of the population exposed, if that serological survey is accurate, has overrun hospitals and led to the death of one in every 400 New Yorkers, while the vast majority of the population remains susceptible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the cost of getting to 20 percent,\u201d said Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral epidemiology researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \u201cIt really illustrates the price you\u2019re going to pay if you want to get up to the 60 percent or 70 percent that you\u2019ll need for herd immunity, and I hope it really illustrates why that just isn\u2019t a feasible plan.\u201d", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Julia Wolfe", "Laura Bronner"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/more-men-than-women-are-dying-from-covid-19-is-it-biology-or-behavior/", "published": "2020-05-11T21:51:51", "title": "More Men Than Women Are Dying From COVID-19.

Blue states, such as Washington and New York, were initially hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis, and stay-at-home orders went into effect as early as March 19 (California was first out of the gate). A number of red states have refrained from implementing such public-safety orders, and many Republican-leaning states, particularly in the South, didn\u2019t issue orders for weeks afterward \u2014 as late as April 3 in Florida and Georgia. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis waffled over closing the state but eventually did so under pressure from state lawmakers.\n\nBut, at least on the front end of this crisis, Americans weren\u2019t deciding what to do based on politics. Americans living in red states appear to have taken the crisis plenty seriously; data shows that residents there were staying home well before their governors issued stay-at-home orders.\n\nCuebiq, a private data company, assessed the movement of people via GPS-enabled mobile devices across the U.S. If you look at movement data in a cross-section of states President Trump won in the southeast in 2016 \u2014 Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Kentucky \u2014 23 percent of people were staying home on average during the first week of March. That proportion jumped to 47 percent a month later across these six states.\n\nIf defying social distancing orders were really a political statement, you\u2019d think that the southeast would be a hotbed for dissent. Yet people in the six states we examined changed their behavior around mid-March, before the states\u2019 official stay-at-home orders. In fact, about 90 percent of the total change between early March and mid-April had occurred in the week before the stay-at-home orders were passed in each state.\n\nThat\u2019s more or less in line with the country at large, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nAlmost uniformly across these states, people started staying home beginning on March 14. The percentage of people staying home rose rapidly over the following nine days and tended to plateau by March 23.\n\nThe Cuebiq data suggests that behavioral changes were largely driven by people making a voluntary choice to stay home rather than being forced to do so by a state-sanctioned stay-at-home order. One need only look at the behavior of residents in North Carolina and their neighbors in South Carolina: While North Carolina issued a stay-at-home order eight days before South Carolina, a stabilized number of people in both states started staying at home about a week before North Carolina\u2019s order.\n\nWhy did people begin to stay at home so early? In mid-March, the seriousness of the virus had begun to permeate the national and international conversation. On March 9, the Dow dropped to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier that same day, Italy announced a nationwide lockdown. On March 11, the NBA announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely, a sign to many Americans that the pandemic would indeed change all facets of life, and on March 12, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Some of the earliest official actions in the U.S. occurred around that time in the state of Washington, when Gov. Jay Inslee announced on March 11 a ban in three counties on gatherings of more than 250 people and public schools in Seattle also announced they would close. Many other U.S. cities closed schools, restaurants and bars in rapid succession around March 16.\n\nThis sort of mass behavioral change in such a short time is significant. It took over 50 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in prevention efforts to lower the percentage of people who smoke in the U.S. from 42 percent in 1965 to 13 percent in 2018. Americans reacted to the threat of COVID-19 in a relative blink of an eye.\n\nThe question that now looms, of course, is whether Americans\u2019 individual behavioral changes will last as the pandemic wears on and the summer sun beckons. We\u2019ll be watching movement data to get a sense of how quickly we will return to normal \u2014 or at least how quickly we establish a new normal.\n\nWhy does COVID-19 make some people sicker than others? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Clare Malone", "Kyle Bourassa"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-not-too-late-for-contact-tracing/", "published": "2020-05-08T15:30:41", "title": "Why It\u2019s Not Too Late For Contact Tracing", "text": "As the U.S. starts to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say we\u2019ll need to track everyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient to stop new chains of infection.

The total count of positive cases now stands at more than 1.2 million, according to numbers from The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nIn our effort to make sense of the range of possible outcomes for the outbreak, we\u2019ve continued to follow the results of a weekly survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the United States. In this week\u2019s survey, conducted May 4 and 5, experts predict that the total number of positive cases in the U.S. will be more than 1.3 million and less than 1.45 million on May 10. The experts also forecast a total of 255,500 deaths attributed to the coronavirus by the end of 2020.\n\nThe survey is organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 10?\n\nLast week, the consensus from the experts was that there would be between 1 million and 1.15 million confirmed U.S. cases by May 3. The reported number of 1,152,006 fell just outside that range, according to The COVID Tracking Project. This week, the researchers were asked to predict the number of confirmed cases by May 10. The expert consensus put the most probable range between 1.3 million and 1.45 million cases. (Like last week, the researchers were given five distinct ranges of total confirmed cases and asked to assign a probability to each bin.)\n\nHow many U.S. jurisdictions will report more new cases in September than in June?\n\nIn a new question, the experts were asked to forecast out to September and predict how many states and territories (plus the District of Columbia) would report more new COVID-19 cases in that month than they did in June. Questions like this require two separate predictions, with one largely conditional on the other. This increases the difficulty and uncertainty of the forecasts.\n\nAccordingly, the distribution of answers given by the experts is more uniform across the range of possible outcomes. But in the mass of uncertainty, there is perhaps some good news: As summer stretches into fall, experts assigned the highest probability to fewer than four states reporting more new coronavirus cases than they had in June.\n\nWhat will happen in Texas?\n\nOn May 1, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott allowed his stay-at-home order to expire. In the most recent seven-day period for which the state is reporting data \u2014 April 30 through May 6 \u2014 the average daily new case count is 1,053. The panel of experts were asked to forecast the average number of new daily cases in Texas during the week ending on June 13.\n\nThe experts predict that the new seven-day daily average in Texas is most likely to rise to between 1,350 and 1,800, affirming the widely held belief that social distancing measures have been effective at containing the spread of the disease. Experts placed a slightly smaller probability on the chances of Texas seeing between 900 and 1,350 new daily cases, on average.\n\nMeanwhile, most experts believe that the average new daily case count would have fallen under the stricter stay-at-home guidelines that Texas previously had in place. The experts forecast a 31 percent probability that the average number of new cases would have been between 675 and 900 had the stay-at-home order not been allowed to expire.\n\nHow many deaths will there be by year\u2019s end?\n\nFinally, the experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 by the end of 2020. The consensus estimate is that 255,500 die, with a 90 percent chance of the death total falling between 118,750 and 1,211,500 \u2014 a large range.\n\nThe low end of the expert\u2019s range may be optimistic, however. The FiveThirtyEight model roundup shows that most models project 100,000 or more deaths by the end of May. Modeling the virus continues to be incredibly challenging, so it\u2019s difficult to know which set of expectations to weight more heavily. But with uncertainty still high and spring in the air, perhaps some optimism in this moment is warranted \u2014 or at least forgivable.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-scientists-think-the-novel-coronavirus-developed-naturally-not-in-a-chinese-lab/", "published": "2020-05-04T19:58:42", "title": "Why Scientists Think The Novel Coronavirus Developed Naturally \u2014 Not In A Chinese Lab", "text": "You could be forgiven for wondering how a disease as fast-moving and deadly as COVID-19 could just appear naturally, out of nowhere, seemingly overnight. President Trump expressed doubt, saying that \u201ca lot of people\u201d were looking at the possibility that a Chinese lab was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier that week, Fox News ran a story in which unnamed sources suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory \u2014 the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses with a number of international collaborators. The New York Times reported that spy agencies are being pressured to find evidence blaming the lab, and at the end of April, the National Institutes of Health withdrew funding from a research consortium that had collaborated with the lab. As recently as this weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, despite saying there was no reason to disbelieve the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the virus was neither manmade nor genetically modified, claimed there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d connecting the virus to the WIV.\n\nBut the truth is almost certainly not that salacious. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, said this dynamic is familiar. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an outbreak, people say, oh, there\u2019s a lab close by.\u201d He should know: In 2014, during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, conspiracy theorists alleged his team\u2019s lab in Sierra Leone, not far from the origin of the outbreak, was a George Soros-funded bioweapons site.\n\nAccording to a growing body of research, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is almost certainly a naturally occurring virus that initially circulated in bats then spilled into humans. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some from trying to find a more sinister origin. \u201cIt seems like such an extreme event that people are looking for an extraordinary explanation for it,\u201d said Stephen Goldstein, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah who studies coronaviruses. No single piece of evidence has yet confirmed the virus\u2019 origin. But according to scientists, the evidence that does exist paints a consistent picture of a wild virus, not one that sprang from a lab.\n\nWhy do scientists think it wasn\u2019t genetically engineered?\n\nTo genetically engineer a new virus, scientists can combine pieces of viruses they\u2019ve seen before. In the case of a genetically engineered coronavirus that was designed to infect humans, the bulk of its genetic material \u2014 its \u201cbackbone\u201d \u2014 would come from SARS or a close relative, while the tools it used to infect cells would be grafted on. But the backbone doesn\u2019t look like any disease-causing virus, and other key parts of the virus are new to science.\n\nIn SARS-CoV-2\u2019s case, scientists thought they knew how to optimize SARS to infect human hosts. Coronaviruses enter host cells using protein \u201cspikes\u201d that cover their outer surface. At the tip of each spike is a cluster of amino acids that can bind to a certain receptor on a host cell, like a pick designed to open a particular cellular lock. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike binds to human ACE2 receptors, which coat lung cells.\n\nThe original SARS coronavirus targeted the same receptors, and after the 2002 SARS epidemic, experiments tinkered with its spike to determine the structure of an \u201coptimized\u201d version of the SARS lock pick. Many factors influence the success of a virus, but its binding ability is thought to be important, so \u201cif you were going to make a new virus, and make it even more infectious than SARS,\u201d said Goldstein, you would give it that optimized tip.\n\nBut, Garry said, the tip of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is unlike anything scientists have seen before, sharing only a single key amino acid with SARS. Modeling suggests that it shouldn\u2019t be able to bind to human lungs well, but the new configuration is about as effective as the optimized SARS.\n\nHow SARS-CoV-2 acquired this unusual tip is still a mystery. But blaming it on genetic engineering overstates the abilities of scientists, Garry said. Guessing that these particular amino acids can bind to ACE2 so effectively is nearly impossible\u2014 there are 20 common types of amino acids, and tens of millions of ways to arrange them into a binding tip. It would be like if you looked out over the proverbial infinite monkeys with their infinite typewriters, guessed that a specific macaque would type out King Lear, and then picked the right animal.\n\n\u201cNobody has that kind of insight into how the viruses evolve or cause disease,\u201d said Garry. \u201cYou could randomly try to make changes, but we\u2019re talking about thousands of years of trying pathogens out. I\u2019ve been really lucky to know a lot of talented virologists, and they\u2019re not clever enough to come up with a virus that\u2019s quite this good at spreading.\u201d\n\nWhat if it was in a petri dish and got out?\n\nAnother theory suggests a researcher at the WIV studying a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally infected.\n\nBut the researchers I spoke to threw cold water on that. \u201cI think it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask these questions and examine all sources of the outbreak,\u201d said Gregory Koblentz, a professor at George Mason University who studies biosecurity. \u201cBut based on what we know of the biology of the virus, a natural source of the outbreak is the most likely explanation.\u201d\n\nThe virus\u2019s spike has a hinge-like structure, allowing the spike to change shape as the virus enters the host cell. Like the spike tip, the hinge on SARS-CoV-2 is markedly different from anything seen in its close relatives. New research suggests that the hinge loses its unique characteristics when cultured in a lab, said Garry. The spike also appears to be able to shield itself from antibodies\u2014another hint that it evolved in the presence of host immune systems.\n\nMost importantly, there\u2019s no smoking gun connecting the lab to an ancestor of the virus. There\u2019s \u201cno bat virus that\u2019s close enough to be the progenitor,\u201d said Garry. The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a cousin that diverged decades ago in bats.\n\nAnd while critics suggest that the WIV might have concealed the ancestral virus, 27 scientists who have collaborated with the WIV, including former U.S. officials, rejected the idea in a letter to The Lancet.\n\nKoblentz agrees there\u2019s not much evidence to suggest a cover-up. \u201cIf the Chinese government suspected that the outbreak was the result of a biosafety breach in Wuhan, I would have expected them to come down very hard on that lab, not letting them talk to foreigners,\u201d he said. But in March, a lead researcher at the WIV talked to Scientific American about her search for the ancestral strain.\n\nThe WIV has released sequences of bat coronavirus in the months since the epidemic started, giving other scientists insight into the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. Several of the early virus genome sequences in an open-source international database were submitted by the WIV, which allowed other countries to begin developing diagnostic tools. That willingness to release data, Koblentz said, could be evidence that weights \u201cthe scale towards [the WIV] being transparent and cooperative.\u201d\n\nThen how\u2019d it get here at all?\n\nThere\u2019s a simpler, if less flashy, explanation for the emergence of a new SARS. A study, published in 2018, of four rural villages in Yunnan province located near caves containing bats known to carry coronaviruses found that 2.7 percent of those surveyed had antibodies for close relatives of SARS. Thousands, if not millions, of people are exposed to wild coronaviruses every year. Most of them aren\u2019t dangerous, but \u201cif you roll the dice enough times,\u201d Goldstein said, you\u2019ll see a bad one.\n\nCritics have raised concerns over biosafety protocols at the WIV, but Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said the criticisms are based on evidence taken out of context. The reports of biosafety issues, she said, are \u201clike having the health inspector come to your restaurant. It could just be, \u2018Oh, you need to keep your chemical showers better stocked.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t suggest, however, that there are tremendous problems.\u201d\n\nAnd Garry reiterated that it\u2019s incredibly unlikely SARS-CoV-2 is the result of a \u201cbad\u201d roll of the dice at the WIV. \u201cAll the natural exposures dwarf the possibility that it was some lab guy that was out catching bats and infected himself. That\u2019s one little thing among millions of encounters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to totally rule out a lab accident, Rasmussen said, but she worries that unilateral, politically charged investigations will permanently damage international scientific collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe live in a global world,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cIt would hurt us tremendously if we were to stop collaborating with Chinese scientists.\u201d The next pandemic is unlikely to come from a lab, just as Ebola, SARS, Zika and avian flu did not, she said.

Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

On Tuesday, the number of Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 passed 1 million, and on Wednesday, deaths attributed to the disease \u2014 which are probably underestimated \u2014 rose to more than 60,000.\n\nAs the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths continue to grow, we checked back in with a survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the U.S. to help us understand where we might be headed.\n\nFor the week ending April 25, 13,788 deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In this week\u2019s survey, which was conducted on April 27 and 28, a plurality of experts predicted that weekly death totals would not fall below 5,000 until after June 20. The experts also forecast that between 1 million and 1.15 million total confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be reported on May 3.\n\nFor some questions in the survey \u2014 organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst \u2014 respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 3?\n\nThe experts have been asked this question in the past, and actual case numbers have fallen within their forecasted ranges. This time, they were given a set of five bins of predefined total confirmed cases and were asked to assign a probability to each. For the week ending May 3, the expert consensus is that between 1.1 and 1.15 million total confirmed cases will be reported by The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nAs has been true throughout the crisis, however, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the predicted confirmed case count. The consensus forecast says that the chance (about 18 percent) that confirmed cases will be between 1.05 and 1.1 million is the same as the chance it will be above 1.2 million.\n\nWhen will new reported deaths per week drop below 5,000?\n\nIn the past two weeks, deaths attributed to the coronavirus have hovered above 13,700 (13,708 and 13,788). A drop to 5,000 weekly deaths would represent a decline of 64 percent \u2014 a substantial decrease. But experts are pessimistic that such a drop will happen in the near future. The expert consensus gives a nearly 40 percent chance of the U.S. hitting the 5,000-death weekly plateau by June 6 and a probability of just over 60 percent of it occurring some time after then.\n\nWhat will happen in Georgia?\n\nOn April 23, Georgia partially reopened for business, and stay-at-home restrictions have continued to be lifted across the state. The seven-day moving average for newly confirmed cases in the Peach State stood at just over 700 per day on April 20. Experts were asked to predict the new daily case average for the week ending on May 16 under the current open regime, along with the daily case average had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe consensus forecast of 1,044 new confirmed cases per day in two weeks suggests that Georgia will see a substantial worsening of the virus\u2019s spread as a result of reopening. The daily number of new confirmed cases is forecast to be somewhere between 579 and 2,292, with six experts indicating that an increase to 2,000 or more new cases a day is plausible.\n\nExperts believe that the spread of COVID-19 could have been reduced had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home order. Under this scenario, experts predicted that Georgia would have seen only 487 new cases per day for the week ending on May 16, a reduction of more than 50 percent in new daily cases compared with the estimates in the open regime.\n\nThere was also less uncertainty among experts in their predictions for Georgia\u2019s new daily cases in the world where Georgia did not relax stay-at-home orders. Experts would have expected between 273 and 1,156 new cases per day, representing a spread half as large as the one for the new-case forecast without the stay-at-home orders.\n\nAs Americans slowly prepare to go back to work, the experts\u2019 forecast helps quantify the increased risk Georgia and other states have incurred by beginning to restart their economies in the midst of a still-uncontrolled pandemic.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen.

But experts don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the gap. Is it biological, some quirk of cells and hormones? Is it the result of gendered behaviors that have more to do with sociology than sex chromosomes? Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s going on, because experts say men\u2019s risk level depends on what risks (and which men) you\u2019re talking about.\n\nWhat we know\n\nWhile men account for the majority of COVID-19 cases in some countries but a minority of cases in others, they consistently make up the majority of deaths. Out of 35 countries that have reported their COVID deaths in ways that break out victims by sex, 33 had a male-female death ratio greater than 1, meaning men who were confirmed to have the disease were more likely to die than women who were confirmed to have it, according to data compiled by Global Health 50/50, an independent health equity research organization based at University College London. \u201cSo far, the mortality disadvantage for men is quite large,\u201d said Jennifer Dowd, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford.\n\nMen are more likely than women to die of COVID-19 Share of COVID-19 patients who died, by gender Deaths among confirmed cases Country male female ratio Dominican Republic 6.5% 2.1% 3.0 Thailand 2.5 0.9 2.7 Greece 7.8 3.1 2.5 Romania 7.9 3.5 2.3 The Netherlands 18.1 8.1 2.2 Italy 17.1 9.3 1.8 Belgium 15.3 8.6 1.8 Northern Ireland 10.4 5.6 1.8 Spain 10.2 5.8 1.8 Ecuador 6.9 3.9 1.8 Denmark 6.6 3.6 1.8 Argentina 6.3 3.5 1.8 Philippines 8.2 4.9 1.7 China 4.7 2.8 1.7 Sweden 15.1 9.4 1.6 Mexico 10.9 6.9 1.6 Switzerland 6.1 3.7 1.6 Ukraine 3.2 2.0 1.6 South Korea 2.9 1.8 1.6 Indonesia 9.3 6.4 1.5 Republic of Ireland 5.8 3.7 1.5 Colombia 5.4 3.5 1.5 Peru 3.1 2.1 1.5 South Africa 1.7 1.1 1.5 Australia 1.5 1.0 1.5 Portugal 4.7 3.3 1.4 Germany 4.5 3.2 1.4 Canada 4.5 3.6 1.3 Austria 4.1 3.1 1.3 Norway 2.9 2.3 1.3 Finland 3.3 2.8 1.2 Luxembourg 2.6 2.1 1.2 Iran 5.9 5.4 1.1 India 2.6 3.1 0.9 Pakistan 2.0 2.8 0.7 Numbers in this table come from different dates, depending on the country and how frequently it updates its publicly available data. Most of the data is dated to April 26-29, though a few countries\u2019 numbers are from earlier in April. China\u2019s data is from Feb. 28 and Iran\u2019s is from March 17. Source: Global Health 50/50\n\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t new to medicine. \u201cWomen have stronger adaptive immune responses and die less of infectious disease their entire lives, starting from infant mortality,\u201d Dowd said. In general, women\u2019s bodies kick out bacterial and viral invaders faster than men\u2019s do, and vaccines work better for women than for men.\n\nTo see why, look to hormones and genetics, said Sabra Klein, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. Sex hormones appear to play a role determining how well human bodies can fight off disease. In general, estrogens amp up the immune system, while androgens (like testosterone) and progesterone suppress it. Hormones have to interact with cells to do their jobs, Klein said, so cells have a \u201clock\u201d and hormones have the \u201ckey\u201d to get in. And, turns out, every immune cell in your body has these kinds of lock-and-key receptors.\n\nSex chromosomes also play a role. The X chromosome, for example, has 60 genes associated with immune function. Most biological males are born with one X chromosome, but those immune-boosting genes tend to be expressed more frequently in women, who generally have two X chromosomes, Klein said.\n\nBut if you\u2019re tempted to think those sex differences boil down to \u201cmen are more likely to die from infectious disease,\u201d Klein cautioned that the generalization is not true across the board. Sex differentiation in influenza has been pretty well studied, she told me, and, in that case, women\u2019s more aggressive immune systems don\u2019t give us an advantage. Having too much of an inflammatory immune response to the flu can actually increase your risk of complications \u2014 including acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the lungs\u2019 tiny air sacs, called alveoli, are damaged and fill with fluid. \u201cReproductive-age women do worse, not better,\u201d Klein said.\n\nWhat we know we don\u2019t know\n\nBut while researchers know a decent amount about sex differences in influenza, the novel coronavirus is, yes, novel. Any research on it is a work in progress, proceeding without full data. That starts with basic documentation.\n\nOn April 28, the United States had reported 57,318 deaths from the novel coronavirus, but only 31,586 of those deaths had been reported in ways that allowed Global Health 50/50 to break them down by sex. None of the researchers I spoke with knew why that data isn\u2019t getting reported. But without it, they\u2019re left to a lot of guesswork and speculation. It\u2019s safe to assume that deaths in the U.S. are probably following the patterns seen in many other countries \u2014 but we don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s true.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the variations in how this virus affects people probably isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in their chromosomes or hormones. It\u2019s also about sociological gender \u2014 the attitudes, stereotypes and norms that shape the ways people behave and the choices they make.\n\nFor example, a 2016 meta-analysis showed that women are about 50 percent more likely than men to start using non-pharmaceutical protective behaviors during a pandemic \u2014 things like wearing face masks or avoiding public transit. Men, meanwhile, were about 12 percent more likely than women to sign up for vaccines, take antiviral medication, or use other pharmaceutical interventions. Those differences in behavior aren\u2019t determined by biology, but they could help create variations in how a virus affects men and women.\n\nRosemary Morgan, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies how gender and sex interact with public health, thinks these kinds of effects are happening with COVID-19. But how and to what extent \u2014 that\u2019s unknown. It also probably differs from country to country, thanks to the way gender norms also aren\u2019t consistent everywhere you go.\n\nCase in point: When data on sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths first began to come in from China, it wasn\u2019t clear that the differences in death rates there would mean other counties were going to experience the same thing. That\u2019s because China has particularly gendered smoking habits, Dowd told me. In a 2010 study, 54 percent of Chinese men surveyed were current smokers. In contrast, the same study found that less than 3 percent of Chinese women currently smoked. Although sex differences in COVID-19 death rates have cropped up again in other countries, it\u2019s likely that this gender disparity in smoking plays a role in why 64 percent of China\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have been among men even though men account for right around half of China\u2019s confirmed cases.\n\nGender norms may also influence the niches where women are getting the disease more than men, despite men\u2019s higher death rates. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the characteristics of health care workers who have contracted COVID-19, it found that 73 percent were women. Why are female health care workers getting infected at much higher rates? Part of it likely has to do with their higher odds of exposure.\n\nNurses\u2019 jobs put them in close physical contact with patients who have COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and more than 70 percent of nurses are women. Meanwhile, the personal protective equipment meant to help keep medical workers safe often isn\u2019t designed with women in mind. Gloves can be too large. Masks don\u2019t always fit women\u2019s faces with a tight seal. Gender dynamics could be putting a largely female workforce in harm\u2019s way.\n\nIn the end, regardless of your sex \u2014 or your gender \u2014 the risks you face from COVID-19 are probably somewhat unique to you. But if we want to figure out just what, exactly, those risks are, we\u2019re going to need more data.\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-the-united-states-has-gotten-over-the-coronavirus-hump/", "published": "2020-04-27T16:49:26", "title": "Do You Buy That \u2026 The United States Has Gotten Over The Coronavirus Hump?", "text": "Do You Buy That \u2026 The United States Has Gotten Over The Coronavirus Hump?", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/should-we-sacrifice-our-data-privacy-to-fight-the-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-04-24T18:36:13", "title": "Should We Sacrifice Our Data Privacy To Fight The Coronavirus?", "text": "Should We Sacrifice Our Data Privacy To Fight The Coronavirus?\n\nSenior writer Neil Paine looks into how personal data is being used to fight COVID-19 and explores when such measures become too invasive.\n\nRead more from Neil Paine.", "author": ["Neil Paine", "Tony Chow"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-chart-isnt-going-to-tell-you-when-the-pandemic-peaked/", "published": "2020-04-23T21:19:02", "title": "One Chart Isn\u2019t Going To Tell You When The Pandemic Peaked", "text": "These days it seems like you can\u2019t even scroll through goat videos on Twitter without hitting a COVID-19 chart \u2014 and people trying to use the chart to understand whether the epidemic has \u201cpeaked.\u201d\n\nSome good news: This graph shows diagnosed cases statewide over the last couple of weeks.

That curve sure seems like it\u2019s bending! Or, that new case number seems lower than yesterday\u2019s!\n\nBut it\u2019s not that easy. Each chart you see reflects a host of decisions \u2014 which data to chart, which source to use, how to compare countries or states, how to display the data \u2014 that can drastically change what you see and what you can safely take away from the chart. To truly understand whether a place has reached the peak of its infection curve, you need to be a savvy reader of the charts and the underlying data. And, ideally, you need to look at more than one chart.\n\nSo what should you keep in mind when you\u2019re trying to interpret all these data visualizations?\n\nWhat is the chart showing?\n\nBefore you can know whether the chart is showing you a peak, you need to know what data it\u2019s showing you in the first place. Are you looking at total confirmed cases? Total hospitalizations? Total deaths? Or is the chart showing you day-by-day counts? Each of these numbers provide information \u2014 but each is incomplete. And they\u2019re not interchangeable.\n\nConfirmed cases\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to tell whether someplace has hit a peak using a chart of confirmed cases. Obviously, we\u2019d like to see the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus decline. But anytime you see something tracking the number of cases, remember how hugely dependent it is on the number of tests being done. Anyplace that doesn\u2019t test for the coronavirus is not going to find cases. That\u2019s especially true in the U.S., where the number of tests done is reportedly minuscule relative to how many people report symptoms.\n\n\u201cWhen we see a plateau, it may just be because we\u2019ve maxed out our testing capacity rather than a true flattening of incident cases,\u201d said Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. In other words, a flatter curve might just mean that the number of tests is failing to keep up with the number of infections. And as some states look to resume certain economic activities, they may have an incentive to keep testing levels low so the number of cases doesn\u2019t appear to increase.\n\nSo let\u2019s change our understanding of these kinds of charts off the bat: These aren\u2019t visualizations of the number of cases, they\u2019re visualizations of the number of confirmed cases, a number that, in most countries, drastically underestimates the true number of people who are sick.\n\nEven if testing was sufficient, the tests themselves still need to be accurate. There are reports that some tests might have shockingly high rates of false negatives \u2014 that is, people who have the disease but get a negative test result at least some of the time.\n\nEven if all cases were somehow measured, there would still be a lag between when someone is infected and when they get tested. It takes time to develop symptoms (the incubation period), have those symptoms get bad enough to send someone to the doctor for a test, and for the test to come back. While the lag likely differs by person, the numbers on a chart of confirmed cases are (even in the best case) quite out of date.\n\nThis lag is also one reason why charts showing the daily number of new cases can be somewhat misleading. What looks like a change happening that day might actually be reflecting a change that started a week or two ago. And lots of funky things can happen as data is collected and reported that can artificially depress or inflate a day\u2019s tally.\n\nAll of that could be dealt with \u2014 if all those factors stayed constant. That is, if people were generally getting tested at the same point in the course of their illness \u2026 and how health care professionals administered the tests wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 and the tests themselves weren\u2019t changing \u2026 and the delay in reporting results wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 then the trends in confirmed cases would still be informative about the virus\u2019s spread, even though the number of confirmed cases wouldn\u2019t directly reflect the number of infections. We\u2019re just looking for a change in the trend line on the chart, after all.\n\nBut the problem is that we don\u2019t know if any of that is staying constant. So it\u2019s very difficult to glean a useful signal from a metric as noisy as confirmed case counts.\n\nDeaths\n\nSo counting cases is fraught. What about just counting deaths? Surely that\u2019s less questionable, since every place already tracks how many people die there, so those numbers should be more reliable. This might be true \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to be sure.\n\nTo track coronavirus deaths, you still need to confirm that a person who died had COVID-19 \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear that that\u2019s being done. Some people aren\u2019t being tested before or after they die, and COVID-19 may not appear on someone\u2019s death certificate even if it seemed likely they had the disease. For people who don\u2019t die at a hospital, establishing the cause of death might be even more challenging, especially if coronavirus tests are scarce and being reserved for the living. And some countries have changed how they count deaths outside of hospitals as this pandemic has ground on, making it harder to interpret the trend over time.\n\nHospitals and governments also have an incentive to underreport COVID-19 deaths, since fatalities can make those institutions look bad. For instance, the CIA doesn\u2019t believe the Chinese government\u2019s official infection and death tallies.\n\nHospitalizations\n\nAre hospitalizations the most accurate type of data? New York City, for example, has started releasing the number of people who have been hospitalized. Assuming that this data is collected correctly, we might think that this is the chart that would provide us the most reliable trend. If it peaked, then that would seem to be a good indicator that the infection has as well, even if most people with COVID-19 are never hospitalized.\n\nBut what happens if the criteria for hospitalization change as the outbreak progresses? If hospitals increase the threshold for admission as they run out of beds \u2014 if, for example, any shortness of breath was enough to get someone admitted in the early days of the pandemic, but health care workers start turning away those patients as resources get scarcer \u2014 then a chart that shows a plateau in hospitalizations could be a sign of a system approaching capacity rather than (or in addition to!) a change in the number of infections. (The same is true, for instance, if people are increasingly told to avoid hospitals unless absolutely necessary.)\n\nHow is the data being displayed?\n\nThe kind of chart you\u2019re looking at also matters. Peaks are even harder to see if charts use a logarithmic scale, which many COVID-19 visualizations do. Using a log scale means that the chart\u2019s vertical axis doesn\u2019t increase the way you might expect, with the distance between 0 and 1,000 being the same size as the distance between 10,000 and 11,000. Instead, the number multiplies for each equally sized space on the y-axis \u2014 that is, if one space on the y-axis goes from 100 to 1,000, the next space of the same size will go from 1,000 to 10,000, and the one after that will go from 10,000 and 100,000, but the size of the gap between each set of those numbers stays the same even as the numbers jump up by bigger and bigger margins. This kind of trick has several advantages, including that it lets you compare a location\u2019s curve when it has a relatively low number of cases and when it has a high number of cases. (If you have a linear scale, in contrast, showing the top end of the scale necessarily means that small values will be very hard to see.)\n\nOn the other hand, using a log scale also means that once you get to higher values, small-looking fluctuations in case counts can reflect pretty big differences in raw numbers. This makes it even harder to visually draw inferences about peaks from charts.\n\nOf course, all of these concerns are even more serious when the chart shows data from more than one place, regardless of whether what\u2019s being compared are different countries or different states. These kinds of charts have all the same issues as the ones tracking numbers in a single place, but that set of problems is multiplied by the number of places on the chart.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLet\u2019s say that, according to one of the metrics above, the curve does seem to be bending downward. What does that mean? Well, first, you might want to look at the other metrics too. If all three measures \u2014 confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 are going down, and the total number of tests administered hasn\u2019t dropped, that makes it more likely that there really is good news. And a better metric \u2014 though still one with issues \u2014 is the share of positive tests out of all tests administered, which tries to account for testing in some way (though it doesn\u2019t address whether who is being tested is changing). (Though if the number of cases is still growing, even if it\u2019s at a lower rate, that would continue to increase the strain on an already burdened health care system.)\n\nAnd as Joshua Epstein, the director of the New York University Agent-Based Modeling Lab, said in an online seminar: With any infectious disease, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of transmission after the peak.\u201d Reaching the peak on a chart doesn\u2019t mean you can go outside again \u2014 it means that the outbreak is at its worst. Even if it is getting better, you might still need to be extremely careful for a while.\n\nAnd even if you are fully convinced that things are truly improving \u2014 new cases are going down, hospitals are nowhere near overcrowding, and the sick are getting better \u2014 what do you do when restrictions ease? Germany, which tested very high rates of people early on in the outbreak and had relatively low case numbers and deaths, has come up with a plan for gradual reopening. But if the peak has been successfully averted and relatively few people have had the disease, that might mean that a second, potentially larger peak is in the offing. Even after the infection peaks, the danger may be on the rise.\n\nCORRECTION (April 23, 2020, 5:41 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated how the y-axis on a logarithmic chart would look.

The COVID-19 crisis has already prompted a huge drop in state tax dollars, and seems likely to cost states hundreds of billions of dollars in lost revenue over the upcoming fiscal year. That\u2019s pushed governors to come to the federal government, hat in hand, asking for a federal bailout. But while Democrats in Congress seem eager to oblige \u2014 a new stimulus package that narrowly passed the House on May 15 includes nearly $1 trillion for state, local and tribal governments \u2014 congressional Republicans and President Trump aren\u2019t sold yet.\n\nThere\u2019s a tinge of moral and political outrage to this debate. Trump has repeatedly suggested that blue-state governors mismanaged their finances and don\u2019t deserve a bailout. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, made headlines last month when he suggested that states should simply file for bankruptcy if they run out of money.\n\nBut experts think that doing nothing could be even more costly in the long run than bailing the states out. Without a lifeline from the federal government, states would have no choice but to start slashing budgets and raising taxes.\n\nRecessions are never easy on state finances, since states rely heavily on tax revenue \u2014 whether it\u2019s income tax, sales tax or property tax \u2014 and all of those sources of income tend to fall when people lose their jobs or stop buying luxuries. And because states generally have to balance their budgets \u2014 unlike the federal government, they can\u2019t go into massive debt during a financial downturn and promise to pay it back later \u2014 they have to make up that missing revenue in other ways. In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, many states took a hatchet to higher education funding and reduced their spending on K-12 education, infrastructure, local governments and their own government workforce \u2014 and raised taxes.\n\nAnd states had barely recovered from the last recession when the COVID-19 crisis arrived. The Great Recession technically ended in 2009, but according to an analysis by the Pew Charitable Trusts published last year, the slowness of the recovery meant that state tax revenues didn\u2019t return to their pre-recession levels until 2013, adjusting for inflation \u2014 much longer than in the previous two recessions. Over this period, states lost an estimated $283 billion in tax revenue. \u201cIt was kind of like falling off a cliff and then walking up a ramp,\u201d said Donald Boyd, co-director of the Project on State and Local Government Finance at the University of Albany.\n\nThis meant that even by the time state revenues had recovered, it took longer for dollars to start flowing toward education or infrastructure. States did put more money into their rainy day funds, which they can draw on during emergencies, in case another recession hit. But that prudent instinct left them with even less cash to spend on other things. By 2018, according to Pew, nearly half of the states were still spending less money than they were a decade earlier. State funding for higher education was down 13 percent, and state infrastructure spending as a share of GDP was at its lowest level in more than 50 years.\n\n\u201cThink about what happens if the main breadwinner in a household loses a job,\u201d said Barb Rosewicz, director of the State Fiscal Health project at the Pew Charitable Trusts. \u201cThere are things you stop spending money on \u2014 maybe you don\u2019t put a new roof on your house, maybe you don\u2019t save for your kid\u2019s college education. Even if the head of the household gets a new job and the salary goes back to where it\u2019s been, there are all these deferred investments you want to catch up on. And that\u2019s how states got left after the last recession.\u201d\n\nAnd now, states are facing an even more devastating budget crisis. There is, of course, a huge amount of uncertainty about how long the COVID-19 pandemic will last, and some states are already beginning the process of reopening, which could bring lost tax money back into their coffers. But the long-term outlook still looks bleak. Analysts at the financial services company Moody\u2019s gamed out a few scenarios in April \u2014 including one that was categorized as \u201csevere\u201d but looks more and more like our current reality \u2014 and found that states could see a shortfall of $172 billion over the next 15 months.\n\nThat\u2019s because in addition to a huge decline in tax revenue, states are facing new, unexpected costs. Earlier relief bills did provide money, including $150 billion from the CARES Act, for the states to use to offset spending in response to the coronavirus, as well as some additional money for Medicaid. But there hasn\u2019t been any federal money directed at the state-level economic impact of the coronavirus crisis, and even the money that\u2019s tied to health costs likely isn\u2019t enough to cover the huge influx of people who have lost their jobs and employer-sponsored health care and now qualify for Medicaid. The 36 states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act are facing a particularly large surge of new recipients, since it\u2019s now especially easy for newly unemployed people to get covered.\n\nIt will be very, very difficult for states to pay for all of these expenses without cutting costs or raising taxes, even if they drain their rainy-day funds. According to analysis by Moody\u2019s, only five states have the reserves they\u2019d need to fully float through a severe recession caused by COVID-19. Most states would need to fill gaps of at least 5 percent.\n\nStates are already facing hard choices about how to manage the giant holes in their budgets. California, for instance, is borrowing money from the federal government to ensure that it can continue to make unemployment payments. But other states are already looking to significantly reduce their spending: Earlier this month, state agencies in Georgia were asked for a revised budget proposal for next year with cuts of 14 percent.\n\nThe trouble is that because states never returned to their pre-recession levels of spending, it will be even harder to find places to trim fat. Higher education often gets slashed early in a recession, Rosewicz said, but because it now makes up an even slimmer portion of many states\u2019 budgets, it\u2019s harder to reap significant savings by making cuts \u2014 especially since universities are simultaneously facing potentially large drop-offs in tuition if they can\u2019t reopen in person in the fall. Similarly, state workforces are smaller now, which means states can\u2019t pocket as much money by laying off or furloughing workers. And with public school teachers already protesting stagnant salaries in many states, significant cuts to K-12 education could be politically dicey.\n\nSo tax hikes could also be coming \u2014 which would also make it even harder to recover from the recession even after the economy starts to pick up again. \u201cThe problem is pretty obvious \u2014 raising taxes is going to make consumers less inclined to spend money,\u201d said Raymond Scheppach, a professor of public policy at the University of Virginia. \u201cThat will make it even harder to get the economy going again.\u201d\n\nBut financial assistance from the federal government could still make a big difference, Scheppach and other experts told me. Studies conducted in the aftermath of the Great Recession suggested that the stimulus funds that were sent to states to help cover Medicaid costs or invest in new infrastructure helped increase employment, and general aid to state governments prevented them from slashing programs and raising taxes when those actions could have hurt the economy even more.\n\nOf course, the stimulus funds during the Great Recession didn\u2019t mean there were no tax increases or spending cuts. But this is another situation, Rosewicz said, where an influx of federal cash would be a good investment, if it prevents states from cutting their budgets to the bone. \u201cFederal aid isn\u2019t the full solution \u2014 this is an unprecedented crisis and we don\u2019t even have a good estimate of what the need is, because we don\u2019t know how long it will be going on,\u201d she said. \u201cBut significant state tax increases and spending cuts will pull even more money out of the economy, and that will almost certainly prolong the recession, so in that sense federal aid is a really essential tool right now.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-first-time-homebuyer-needs-rent-to-keep-his-house-but-his-tenants-are-broke/", "published": "2020-05-18T14:00:14", "title": "This First-Time Homebuyer Needs Rent To Keep His House. But His Tenants Are Broke.", "text": "The way Ricardo Concepcion sees it, April 1 should have been one of the happiest days of his life.\n\nAbout six weeks earlier, he and his wife had closed on a multifamily home in New Jersey. It was an \u201cAmerican dream\u201d sort of milestone for the 40-year-old, who had once been homeless but would now own a home for the very first time. The $450,000 price tag was a bit daunting, but Concepcion \u2014 a real estate agent \u2014 planned to rent out the part of the house he wasn\u2019t living in to make his mortgage more affordable. Some tenants already lived on the second floor, though he hoped to rent the second and third floors as a single unit.\n\nBut on the first of April, the day Concepcion tried to move in, he found a problem at the front door of the house he and his wife had just bought: A man and his adult daughter said they lived on the first floor.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s Day 1, my wife and two young daughters are about to come over, and I\u2019m on the phone with the police, who have to come and hash out a squatter\u2019s rights situation.\u201d Concepcion said he broke down during the ordeal and asked his brother to come by to help calm him down. When the dust settled, though, the police essentially told Concepcion to hand over a key to the man and woman. Because of the pandemic, the state suspended evictions and foreclosures back in March.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nConcepcion doesn\u2019t want the man and his daughter on the street \u2014 if anyone is sensitive to that possibility, he says, it\u2019s him. But he\u2019s worried about falling behind on his brand-new mortgage \u2014 one he intended to pay for mostly by leasing out the second and third floors at a market rate. \u201cI actually had someone lined up to rent the place, but then I had to give the unit up to this guy,\u201d he said.\n\nConcepcion\u2019s situation points to a somewhat prickly issue amid the coronavirus outbreak: Landlords are often seen as multimillionaires who can weather financial storms because they own so much property. But the reality is that about half the rental properties in the U.S. belong to landlords who own no more than 10 properties, and many of those 8 million individual landlords rely on the nominal rent they collect.\n\nOver time, Concepcion has developed a good relationship with the man and his daughter. They were initially subletting a master bedroom and walk-in closet from previous renters for $600 a month, but now for the time being, they are living on the entire third floor \u2014 with two bedrooms, two baths and a finished kitchen \u2014 for that amount. Concepcion doesn\u2019t blame them for the situation, and he appreciates that they pay what they can. (Concepcion said the man has done handiwork at the home since he can\u2019t afford the full rent.)\n\n\u201cI share my wireless with him,\u201d Concepcion said. \u201cWe\u2019re at a good place now.\u201d\n\n\u2018I do not buy that COVID deaths are over counted\u2019: Nate Silver\n\nStill, because of Concepcion\u2019s financial reality, he\u2019s almost certain to serve his \u201ctenant\u201d with a 60-day vacate order once New Jersey state courts reopen. Concepcion had already taken that approach with the second-floor tenants, but for a different reason: The home is legally listed as a two-family home, meaning he can be fined if he rents out the second and third floors separately. (The second-floor renters \u2014 who have also seen their employment affected by COVID-19 \u2014 aren\u2019t in a position to afford the full apartment.)\n\nSo, in a nutshell, Concepcion now owns a home with two tenants, both of whom he\u2019s been forced to rent to for less than the going rate, which will put more financial pressure on him and his wife once their three-month period of mortgage forbearance expires. (The monthly mortgage on the home is a little less than $3,500. Concepcion says he would be getting $650 more per month if he had tenants paying market rate.)\n\nConcepcion received a $1,200 stimulus payment but isn\u2019t eligible for unemployment. In different circumstances, he would be a bit better insulated from a shortfall here or there. He got his real estate license late last year, and for extra money, he has driven part-time for Uber and rented a second car out to someone who also drives for the ride-sharing company. But all those sources of income have fallen away: He\u2019s held only one property showing over the past few months, and Uber ridership is down considerably, with fewer people needing transportation and drivers feeling unsafe being exposed to countless passengers in their cars. Because of that dwindling market, the person renting Concepcion\u2019s car can\u2019t fully afford the weekly fee.\n\nRather than reclaim the car, Concepcion simply agreed to lower the man\u2019s payments. \u201cThe better of the two evils is for me to just come out of pocket a few hundred bucks a month instead of paying an entire note on the vehicle and the entire commercial insurance for it,\u201d he said.\n\nThe last month and a half has been a whirlwind for Concepcion. More than anything, he\u2019s stunned by the irony of his situation. For much of his life, he had been forced to move frequently for reasons beyond his control. His parents were incarcerated during parts of his childhood, so he and his brother bounced from place to place. \u201cWhen my mom would get out of jail, we would stay with her,\u201d Concepcion said. \u201cBut we would get evicted every other year. That was kind of the pattern of our life. We were hood famous, because we lived on so many blocks.\u201d\n\nWhile he and his wife thought they were taking full control of their situation by buying a house, they\u2019ve had almost no say in who is living in their new home so far. And, because of the financial strain, they haven\u2019t been able to fully embrace the happiness they thought home ownership would bring them.\n\nStill, Concepcion has faith that things will work out. Though he has repeatedly second-guessed himself on the timing of all this, he thinks about how, if he and his wife had waited to purchase the home, the virus and its impact on the markets would have drained much of the 401(k) money that they used for their down payment.\n\n\u201cHad I not done this when I did, I probably wouldn\u2019t have qualified for the house,\u201d Concepcion said. \u201cI honestly think things are going to be good for us once everything clears up. The pandemic is the only reason we aren\u2019t feeling that life-changing feeling yet.\u201d", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-industries-hit-hardest-by-the-unemployment-crisis/", "published": "2020-05-15T18:35:25", "title": "The Industries Hit Hardest By The Unemployment Crisis", "text": "On Thursday, the U.S. Department of Labor reported that 2.98 million more Americans had filed for unemployment insurance in the previous week, bringing the total for claims since March 8 up to 36.8 million.

So which parts of the economy have seen the most damage? Using data from the most recent jobs report, I dug into changes in total nonfarm employment by sector from February \u2014 the last full month before the coronavirus-triggered economic crisis truly began \u2014 to April, starting at the \u201dsupersector\u201d level, or the most broadly grouped parts of the economy:\n\nWhich major industries are hit hardest by unemployment?

But it\u2019s clear that the leisure and hospitality industry was hurt far more than any other. In February, nearly 17 million Americans worked in that supersector, which comprises the arts, entertainment and recreation sector \u2014 including spectator sports and gambling \u2014 and the accommodations and food services sector. By April, that number had fallen by nearly 50 percent, to just 8.7 million.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality fields suffered heavy job losses Percent change in seasonally adjusted leisure and hospitality employees from February to April 2020, by supersector, sector and subsector Employees (millions) Industry Feb.

As such, leisure and hospitality businesses were always going to struggle under the pandemic\u2019s terrible constraints. Every subsector of this industry has lost at least 25 percent of its employees since February, and most have lost 40 percent or more. Among all the sectors and subsectors tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of April, only one \u2014 scenic and sightseeing transportation, which falls under the umbrella of trade, transportation and utilities \u2014 saw more job losses than amusements, gambling and recreation, which shed 60 percent of its employees in a two-month period.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t hit as hard as leisure and hospitality, the \u201cother services\u201d supersector also saw a 22 percent reduction in positions from February to April.

The struggles of hairstylists and cosmetologists during this crisis are well-documented, as these professions made up more than half the jobs in this supersector in 2019. And although laundry workers have been deemed essential in some states, many have seen business volume drop significantly \u2014 not only because customers have been avoiding unnecessary trips outside but also because homebound teleworkers aren\u2019t dressing as nicely as they otherwise would. As a result, the number of employees working in that slice of the economy has fallen by 54 percent since February.\n\nFor most other supersectors, jobs have dropped by somewhere between 8 and 13 percent since before the coronavirus crisis started, meaning almost every corner of the economy has been touched by the pandemic. The only areas experiencing more modest (though still significant) losses were in government \u2014 with workers at the federal level faring better than their state or local counterparts \u2014 and financial activities:\n\nFinancial and government jobs are weathering the storm Percent change in seasonally adjusted financial activities and government supersector employees from February to April 2020, by supersector, sector and subsector Employees (millions) Industry Feb.

But even among the supersectors weathering things best, certain areas have seen plenty of job losses: The real estate market is teetering on the edge of a rent crisis, as unemployed tenants struggle to make payments, and rental/leasing jobs are down more than 20 percent from a few months ago. Both state and local government education are also down more than the overall government average over the past few months.\n\nBut those areas are still doing better than some others.

But no matter the size of the industry, only a few areas managed to resist a net decline in employees, compared with their pre-coronavirus norms.\n\nWith even more people filing unemployment claims every day that the coronavirus lockdowns continue, these numbers are likely to get even worse. By definition, recessions always exact a terrible toll on the job market. But this one is unusual in just how many people are out of work \u2014 and how wide-ranging the unemployment has already been.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-getting-more-money-from-unemployment-than-they-were-from-their-jobs/", "published": "2020-05-15T11:00:49", "title": "Many Americans Are Getting More Money From Unemployment Than They Were From Their Jobs", "text": "The United States is not known for its generosity to the unemployed. But the coronavirus crisis has transformed our system for compensating jobless workers. As tens of millions of workers suddenly became unemployed, Congress passed an expansive relief package with an unprecedented $600-per-week supplement for jobless workers. The goal was to replace their wages so they could survive the economic lockdown.\n\nAs a result, though, many people may now be eligible for substantially more money while unemployed than they made while they were working. A new analysis by Peter Ganong, Pascal Noel and Joseph Vavra, economists at the University of Chicago, uses government data from 2019 to estimate that 68 percent of unemployed workers who can receive benefits are eligible for payments that are greater than their lost earnings. They also found that the estimated median replacement rate \u2014 the share of a worker\u2019s original weekly salary that is being replaced by unemployment benefits \u2014 is 134 percent, or more than one-third above their original wage. A substantial minority of those workers, particularly in low-wage professions like food service and janitorial work, may end up receiving more than 150 percent of their previous weekly salary.\n\nThe research underscores one of the central \u2014 and most politically explosive \u2014 tensions of our economic crisis: What\u2019s the best way for our battered unemployment insurance system to keep jobless workers afloat during a historic downturn with no end in sight?\n\nThe idea behind a $600 payment was simple: In 2019, the national average unemployment payment was $370 per week and the national average salary for unemployment recipients was $970 per week. The additional $600 per week is meant to make up the difference, providing enough money on a weekly basis to fully replace the average unemployment recipient\u2019s salary. Other analyses of estimated average wages and unemployment benefits have already shown, though, that replacement rates likely vary quite a bit by state.\n\nBut looking at average wages doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, because the country\u2019s significant income inequality means that more workers fall into lower-wage categories. To address that problem, the new analysis simulates benefits for the median \u2014 rather than the mean \u2014 unemployment-eligible worker, drawing on Census Bureau labor supply data.\n\nThis data comes with a few important caveats. One is that because government data lags, the sample of workers the researchers drew on for the analysis does not reflect the much larger pool of people who are unemployed right now. If anything, Ganong told me, that means the researchers\u2019 estimates may understate how many unemployed workers will be eligible to receive more than their original salary during the current crisis, since the effects of the economic shutdown have disproportionately hit lower-income workers. Plus, the fact that workers are eligible for unemployment insurance doesn\u2019t mean they have the benefits yet. Delays in applying for and receiving unemployment payments have been widely reported across the country, and some workers are still struggling to get through their state\u2019s system.\n\nThe analysis illustrates how something that seems like a simple proposition \u2014 replacing jobless workers\u2019 salaries while a public health threat persists \u2014 is not something our unemployment insurance system was built to do quickly or easily. Most of the experts I spoke with agreed that back in March, when the unemployment insurance expansion passed, a flat payment was the most feasible solution. Unemployment benefits are always inconsistent across states, though, since each state sets its own rates. And now, those inequalities are even more pronounced. The median unemployment-eligible worker in Massachusetts is eligible for an estimated 125 percent of her former salary, compared to 166 percent in Mississippi.\n\nThe researchers uncovered other kinds of inequality, too. In some professions, like janitorial work, people who are employed by essential businesses are continuing to show up to their jobs under hazardous conditions. But in doing so, they may be eligible for less money than janitors who have been laid off or furloughed by a nonessential business. In an ideal world, Ganong said, the people who have kept working at hospitals or grocery stores would be receiving some kind of hazard pay. \u201cBut that\u2019s generally not the reality, which means there\u2019s a weakness in the current system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving more money to certain workers to stay home than to other workers who are putting themselves at risk by going to work.\u201d\n\nSeveral economists and unemployment insurance experts reviewed a draft of the analysis at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s request. Many were surprised by the number of workers estimated to be eligible for unemployment benefits that exceeded their original wages. \u201cI think we all knew that some workers were going to be getting more than their original earnings,\u201d said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI would not have guessed that it was quite this many workers, but I certainly think that it\u2019s a completely plausible figure.\u201d\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThe question is whether this will be a problem as the economy starts to reopen. In addition to the inequality inherent in possibly replacing some workers\u2019 wages at a higher rate, it might not make financial sense for workers to search for other jobs or even return to their original jobs if they\u2019re making substantially more money by staying home. Some experts don\u2019t see that as a bad thing \u2014 in fact, to some, providing an extra incentive to stay home during a pandemic might be a feature, not a bug. \u201cMy bigger worry is that workers will feel pressured to go back to an unsafe job,\u201d said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. But it could also make it more difficult for businesses to convince their workers to return \u2014 at least, at the salaries they were being paid before.\n\nA fight is already brewing on Capitol Hill about whether the $600-per-week payment should be continued after it expires at the end of July. House Democrats have argued that it\u2019s working well, and proposed a straightforward renewal of the existing payment as part of a bigger relief package. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for a cap on benefits or a bonus for workers who return to work. Another option, Ganong and his coauthors point out, is for the federal government to provide workers with a percentage of their lost wages that, combined with state unemployment insurance payments, would come close to replacing their original salary.\n\nBut that would require a more complex calculation by state unemployment insurance agencies \u2014 one they might be unwilling or unable to implement. \u201cIn a perfect world, I would prefer to give people a percentage of their income,\u201dsaid Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cBut we might not be set up to do it.\u201d Many state unemployment insurance agencies are still using decades-old computer systems, for example, presenting potential technical challenges if Congress asked them to change the benefits formula. And Daniel Zeitlin, the director of policy at Washington state\u2019s unemployment office, said that while he didn\u2019t think it was impossible, any change would be difficult for a system already under tremendous stress.\n\nAnother route is to simply reduce the fixed bonus payment when the $600-per-week benefit expires, or \u2014 as some Democratic politicians have proposed \u2014 phase out the benefit as social distancing requirements are eased and the unemployment rate starts to go down. Ramping down to a payment as small as $100 or $200 each week would still be generous by historical standards, according to Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, an economist at Harvard University. And it would continue to provide some kind of buffer for workers who have trouble finding jobs.\n\nSimply reducing the payment could end up exaggerating the lopsidedness rather than fixing it, though. According to the University of Chicago team\u2019s analysis, halving the payment to $300 per week would still mean that 42 percent of unemployed workers would be getting more than their original wages \u2014 and some people would be receiving a smaller fraction of their previous salary. A $300 weekly payment would leave one-quarter of unemployed workers with replacement rates below 60 percent. \u201cLots of people who earn more than the average or median wage are still living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Shierholz said. With a lower replacement rate, some of those people might start to struggle to pay for necessities like rent or groceries.\n\nSo if Congress opts to extend the expanded unemployment insurance program past the end of July, politicians will have to decide how much an unevenly distributed benefit really matters, particularly as public health concerns continue to loom. And the fate of the next phase of relief to jobless workers may hinge in part on what state unemployment insurance agencies can actually do. \u201cIt looks like health concerns are going to prevent a fast recovery, so it makes sense to keep a substantial boost to replacement rates,\u201d Chodorow-Reich said. \u201cIn an ideal world, the next round of funds will probably be more tailored to workers\u2019 individual circumstances. The question is whether our totally antiquated systems will be capable of pulling that off.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-part-time-consultant-and-uber-driver-navigated-through-filing-for-unemployment/", "published": "2020-05-11T14:00:08", "title": "This Part-Time Consultant And Uber Driver Navigated Through Filing For Unemployment", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nOver the past two months and change, millions of Americans have found themselves in highly vulnerable employment positions. Among those feeling the most pressure are people with ties to the live entertainment industry, which has been brought to its knees by its inability to generate ticket revenue, and people who rely on in-person interaction.\n\nThen there\u2019s Brandi Davidson, who held multiple jobs and earned a solid income but whose gigs fall right in the center of that unfortunate Venn diagram. She worked in public relations for arts festivals, many of which have been canceled by now, and drove part time for Uber.\n\nThe 46-year-old D.C. resident has stopped her Uber work for now: Bookings have fallen as people stay home, and Davidson doesn\u2019t feel safe driving anyway. And her boyfriend, who also drives for Uber to earn part-time income, has a few underlying health conditions that would put him at greater risk if he were to come down with the highly contagious virus.\n\nOf course, the flipside of that vigilance is that the household of three \u2014 they serve as guardians for their 9-year-old godson \u2014 is generating no income at the moment. \u201cI took most of my cash out of the bank when this thing started,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cPart of it was me being nervous. But that pile of cash is almost gone.\u201d\n\nDavidson first noticed something strange in her routing back in late February or early March. She also works as a driver for HopSkipDrive, an Uber-like transportation service that provides rides for young children. Because she lives in the D.C. area, Davidson often drives the kids of dignitaries \u2014 some of whom were beginning to cancel their pre-scheduled rides. A week and a half into March, \u201cI lost about 50 percent of the rides I\u2019d normally get that week,\u201d she said. That was when she realized that her earlier cancellations may have stemmed from a handful of high-ranking federal workers understanding the extent of the virus sooner \u2014 and pulling their kids out of school accordingly.\n\nEach time Davidson looked at her dwindling pile of cash, she thought about getting back in her car. No, she wouldn\u2019t pick up and drop off people, which she considers too risky. But maybe sign up to deliver food for Uber? Then she considered where she lives \u2014 right near a hospital \u2014 and the fact that she\u2019d likely have to deliver to people who are working on patients who may be infected with the virus.\n\nIt\u2019s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t sort of feeling, she says. Many things have felt that way. Back in March, as the virus spread and it was clear that Davidson would have no money coming in, she took the step of filing for unemployment. She got an almost instant rejection. \u201cI knew that couldn\u2019t be the end of the answer,\u201d said Davidson, who has consistently made from $60,000 to $65,000 a year.\n\nShe then called the unemployment office and waited 6\u00bd hours on hold. As long as the wait was, the advice she ended up getting was helpful. She was told that her rejection was likely related to the unusual filing situations of Davidson and her boyfriend: Their Uber roles are considered non-wage jobs, and their consultant positions are seen as independent contractors. Complicated unemployment filings from people in those positions can\u2019t be greenlighted as easily, and first-time rejections are common. Davidson\u2019s adviser told her that the unemployment office would need more time to implement a better-fitting set of filing options for non-wage employees.\n\n\u201cThe system wasn\u2019t made for people like us,\u201d said Davidson, who files quarterly income statements for her work with Uber, which doesn\u2019t report worker income to the government.\n\nEven in light of the marathon call with the unemployment office, Davidson has kept a level head despite the stressful situation. She\u2019s not unfamiliar with being forced to make a situation more workable, having once negotiated a $700 medical bill down to closer to $100.\n\nHer persistence paid off: Aside from receiving their $1,200 stimulus checks, Davidson and her boyfriend finally qualified for unemployment, which has translated into checks for a little less than $800 a week each. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without unemployment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my salary, and of course I\u2019d need to make more at some point, but I feel completely blessed that it eventually came through.\u201d\n\nDavidson and her family have been able to avoid one key challenge facing many American families: They recently moved into a home her boyfriend inherited from his grandmother, eliminating any concerns about monthly housing payments.\n\nStill, as someone whose livelihood depends heavily on people having to be somewhere \u2014 be it a summer festival, or even just needing a ride-sharing option to make it to that festival \u2014 Davidson looks forward to being able to earn again. But she just doesn\u2019t want the reopening process to happen too soon, which could put people like her boyfriend at risk.\n\nDavidson takes that step seriously, so much so that she told her godson\u2019s mother that, because of the risks involved, they couldn\u2019t continue to shuttle the 9-year-old between their homes anymore \u2014 essentially saying either his mother would have to wait out the pandemic to visit with the child again, or that Davidson and her boyfriend would need to.\n\n\u201cI probably cried for three days after that,\u201d she said, adding that they recently decided to have the boy stay with his mother for the time being. \u201cBut that\u2019s how strongly I feel about it. My thought is, when hospitals say it\u2019s safe to go visit a loved one, then I\u2019ll think it\u2019s safe to go out and have things return to normal again.\u201d\n\nWhy does COVID-19 make some people sicker than others? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-terrible-jobs-report-gets-worse-the-more-you-read-it/", "published": "2020-05-08T15:18:06", "title": "The Terrible Jobs Report Gets Worse The More You Read It", "text": "Remember last month, when the jobs report was bad but not apocalyptic? Those were the days. The most recent jobs report is a stunning picture of how the pandemic has reshaped the country\u2019s labor market. Overall, 20.5 million fewer people were employed last month than in March. And the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 14.7 percent \u2014 by far the worst we\u2019ve seen in more than seven decades of economic data.\n\nBut the speed of the crisis also means that these numbers are already out of date. The jobs report is based on surveys of businesses and households taken during the middle of April, but the economic situation likely worsened as the month went on. And key metrics, like the unemployment rate, aren\u2019t capturing all the people who are actually out of work right now. According to this month\u2019s report, millions of workers were counted as employed even though they were absent from work for an unspecified reason \u2014 and if they had been counted as unemployed on a temporary layoff, the unemployment rate would have been 5 percentage points higher. In other words, as catastrophic as this report might seem, it almost certainly understates the pandemic\u2019s full economic devastation.\n\nTo be clear, that\u2019s not the fault of the researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who put the report together. Our economic data just wasn\u2019t designed for a moment where entire sectors of the economy shut down pretty much overnight, leaving millions of people without jobs. \u201cI think of our economic indicators as being a kind of a finely tuned speedometer that says, \u2018Are we a little over the speed limit or a little under?\u2019\u201d said Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report. \u201cAnd right now it\u2019s like we just pulled the emergency brake on the highway.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the report is useless or wrong. But making sense of the numbers \u2014 and what they mean for our ability to recover from this mess \u2014 is going to take a little more work than usual. Here\u2019s what to bear in mind as you read coverage of the jobs report (or dive into the nitty-gritty yourself) that can help you understand just how bad these numbers are, and what they mean for how the recession could play out.\n\nHeadline numbers may understate the damage\n\nThis month, there are good reasons to dig deeper into the report. There\u2019s always a significant amount of uncertainty in one of the topline numbers \u2014 the 20.5 million jobs that were lost \u2014 but the scale of the damage this month means that this month\u2019s estimate could be off by tens or even hundreds of thousands of jobs. Take the initial revision for payroll losses in March. Last month, the BLS reported that 701,000 jobs were lost. In this month\u2019s report, though, it\u2019s adjusted that to 870,000. And the April job losses are much, much larger, which means this month\u2019s report could be underestimating the magnitude of the damage by a significant amount.\n\nThe one thing we know for sure is that the unemployment rate is historically high. The government has been tracking this number for more than 70 years, and up till now, the peaks were 10.8 percent in 1982 and 10.0 percent in 2009. For context, economic historians estimate that during the Great Depression, the unemployment rate hit a peak of about 25 percent.\n\nThe real number may actually be closer to that Great Depression peak, because by this metric, only people without jobs who have been actively looking for one are considered unemployed. In normal times, that\u2019s already a bit of an issue because it means frustrated job seekers who have given up on finding something aren\u2019t counted. Now, the problem is even bigger because so many workers are being encouraged to stay home to combat the coronavirus. Others might not be job-hunting because they believe there\u2019s no work to be had.\n\n\u201cJob search is going to be tough when it\u2019s a public health risk to be in contact with people and whole sectors of the economy is effectively shut down,\u201d said Nick Bunker, a labor economist at the hiring site Indeed. \u201cSo lots of people who are out of work are probably not going to be included in the unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the possibility that some people may have been counted as employed even though it might be more accurate to say they\u2019re temporarily out of work. The misclassification may have happened because of the way workers are surveyed \u2014 if they say they were absent from work during the entire week that\u2019s referenced in the survey, interviewers follow up and ask why. Usually, the reasons fall into a standard set of buckets \u2014 vacation, childcare responsibilities, illness. But the number of workers who said they were absent from work for \u201cother reasons\u201d skyrocketed once the pandemic started, indicating that some people who had actually been furloughed may have misunderstood the question and answered in a way that indicated they were still employed.\n\nThis was a problem the BLS ran into in March, and again in April. In March, the researchers estimated that about 1.4 million people may have been misclassified as employed when they were actually temporarily out of work due to the pandemic; this month, it\u2019s a whopping 7.5 million people. According to the BLS, the April unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher if these people were included.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of just how many people are out of a job, there\u2019s another metric in the report that might be more useful \u2014 the share of the adult population who are employed. This number is particularly helpful in recessions, because that\u2019s when more people are likely to become discouraged and stop looking for work. This month, 51.3 percent of the adult population has a job, down from 60 percent in March. That\u2019s also a historic drop \u2014 and yet that number may also underestimate the damage because of the people who may have been mistakenly classified as employed.\n\nThe damage is widespread\n\nIt\u2019s important, too, to look not just at how many people are out of work, but which sectors of the economy have been hit hardest and which are continuing to do well. \u201cThere\u2019s a real question about how many industries can weather this moment,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative. In March, the job losses were overwhelmingly concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes bars and restaurants. This month, those industries were hit hardest again: leisure and hospitality lost 7.7 million jobs, a decline of 47 percent.\n\nBut the overall job losses were more spread out than they were last month, signaling that the effects of the shutdown are already rippling into other industries. For instance, there were sharp declines in the health care sector, mainly concentrated in dentists\u2019 and private doctors\u2019 offices, many of which were forced to close or lost a significant amount of business due to the pandemic. Retail, professional and business services \u2014 including temporary help services and services to businesses and dwellings \u2014 and manufacturing also lost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nThere were also some noteworthy disparities in who was more likely to be unemployed. The April unemployment rate was highest for Hispanic workers, at 18.9 percent, but black workers (16.7 percent) were also more likely to be unemployed than Asian (14.5 percent) or white (14.2 percent) workers. Racial disparities in the unemployment rate aren\u2019t that unusual \u2014 black workers, for example, generally have a higher unemployment rate than other groups. But the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers in particular was historically high, underscoring a running theme of this pandemic: workers of color are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the economic havoc.\n\nWomen (15.5 percent) also had a higher unemployment rate than men (13 percent) \u2014 which is atypical, since women usually have a lower unemployment rate than men. And in recessions, men are usually the first to feel the impact. But women are more likely to hold jobs in the industries that have been pummeled since the pandemic began, like health care and child care services, which may explain why they\u2019re experiencing more of the job losses this time around.\n\nGimbel told us she\u2019ll also be looking at the diffusion index, which is a measure that shows how many industries are gaining or losing jobs. That number, she said, can tell us at a glance \u201chow widespread the carnage is.\u201d This month, the diffusion index is 4.8, which is shockingly low, and signals that job losses were extremely widespread across industries. In February, for example, the diffusion index was 53.7.\n\nAnother important tidbit that\u2019s not captured in the employment figures but reflects how widespread the damage has been: the number of people who were working part-time because they couldn\u2019t find full-time work or their hours were reduced doubled in April, landing at 10.9 million.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in trying to figure out how painful the recovery might be, you can learn a lot by looking at the share of people who were temporarily laid off in April, rather than permanently fired. This may be the least catastrophic part of the report. As in March, the vast majority of jobs lost in April were temporary: 18.1 million of the newly unemployed said they had lost their jobs temporarily, while 2.0 million said the loss was permanent. To be clear \u2014 in a more normal moment, 2.0 million lost jobs would be an eye-popping number. But the fact that the job losses are mostly temporary is important because it will be much easier for people who have been furloughed to return to work when businesses start to reopen \u2014 assuming, of course, that those businesses haven\u2019t shuttered in the meantime.\n\nRead the fine print\n\nThe jobs report is based on two surveys: one of businesses, and one of ordinary households. Normally, that\u2019s barely worth remarking on. But this is not an ideal time to be doing surveys of businesses or people. Last month, the call centers where the surveys are conducted were shut down, and in-person follow-up interviews aren\u2019t happening either. That increases the uncertainty around the numbers in ways that BLS researchers explained in a 14-page note that accompanied the jobs report.\n\nTake the response rate. Julie Hatch Maxfield, an associate commissioner at the BLS, told us some variation in the share of participants who respond is normal, particularly because the survey of businesses is sometimes conducted on a more truncated timeline. In April, the response rate for the survey of businesses was actually much higher than it was in March. But the response rate for the survey of households was 70 percent, compared to 73 percent in March. That lower response rate introduces more uncertainty \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to know how that uncertainty influenced the data. For example, Gimbel pointed out it\u2019s possible that unemployed people may actually be overrepresented in the household survey, because they have more time to talk with a government interviewer.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to predict what next month\u2019s jobs report will show, it is likely to offer more detail about how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting Americans economically. A series of questions are being added to next month\u2019s survey of households that will capture how the pandemic has changed our work lives \u2014 for instance, whether people are teleworking, or if the crisis has kept them from searching for work. That might not solve all of the problems with the unemployment rate, but it will make the economic picture a little clearer \u2014 although probably not more uplifting.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 broke the jobless claims chart", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-essential-worker-is-busier-than-ever-without-leaving-her-house/", "published": "2020-05-04T14:00:46", "title": "This Essential Worker Is Busier Than Ever Without Leaving Her House", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nThe nation\u2019s unemployment statistics are staggering, and the stories of the workers who constitute those numbers are humbling, including those who suddenly had job offers rescinded and those who have seen their hours cut as a result of the coronavirus\u2019s spread.\n\nBut another reality of this downturn is that some have seen an increase in work the past two months. Many of them hold the kind of essential jobs that wouldn\u2019t immediately come to mind.\n\nRomie Faienza, a 39-year-old Massachusetts resident, is one such person. Faienza works as a closed captioner and specializes in live voice writing \u2014 she listens to what is said during an event and carefully repeats that wording into a microphone connected to her computer, where her speech is transcribed into written words.\n\nShe has had her hands full since the pandemic emerged in the United States. Along with the daily briefings that President Trump had been doing, governors from states across the country started holding news conferences on the fallout from COVID-19. The process of transcribing what is said at them, given their importance and that more people who are hard of hearing would be at home watching the news, is both a busy and critical task for the time being.\n\nBefore all this, Faienza was working 40-hour weeks but was plotting out how she would use the time off she had accumulated. \u201cI actually spoke with my supervisor and said I intended to work a lot less\u201d this year, Faienza said, adding that she uses spare time to edit magazine pieces and write screenplays.\n\nBut then the pandemic happened, totally altering that plan. Now, she\u2019s working 50-hour weeks to keep up.\n\nThe demand for her work appears to go beyond just the additional hours. Faienza said another captioning company reached out to her recently, in the hopes of convincing her to consider a job with them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m flattered, but I can\u2019t entertain the idea of making a big change right now,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe notion of stability has always been meaningful for Faienza. Her voice has to remain consistently level \u2014 both in terms of volume and intonation \u2014 to ensure her captioning will come across clearly and accurately. And from a financial standpoint, she and her husband had made a point to save pretty aggressively in case something unforeseen came up.\n\nThings seem solid for now for Faienza, who made just less than $50,000 last year and is the family\u2019s breadwinner. With overtime, she\u2019s earning about $200 more per paycheck, and her stimulus money is still on the way as well. Lately, she\u2019s used some of her overtime pay to purchase gift cards at suburban Boston-area restaurants. \u201cI want these places to still be there when all of this is over,\u201d she said.\n\nFaienza\u2019s real challenge has been in areas that others throughout the country can likely relate to: the emotional toll the news can take on those who, like Faienza, have no choice but to immerse themselves in it.\n\nWhile her work itself hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed \u2014 \u201cMy life was already pretty socially distanced, because I work from home in a studio with the door closed,\u201d she said \u2014 it\u2019s challenging for her to put in a few extra hours each day because she has two young sons, 6 and 8 years old. The older child has said he misses being in school \u2014 and not just because he doesn\u2019t get to see his friends and teacher. He told Faienza that he genuinely misses the sense of achievement that accompanies doing a good job on a test or an assignment.\n\nFortunately, the kids are positioned well from a schooling standpoint: Ciro, Faienza\u2019s husband, is serving as their teacher for now. And the transition is likely smoother for him than for other parents, since he already has teaching experience, having previously taught English to people looking to acquire it as a foreign language.\n\nFaienza\u2019s parents, who are about 70 years old, live with the rest of the family, so the concept of leaving the house for an outing of some sort hasn\u2019t been entertained. But the kids seem to have adapted to that part of the deal OK so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty nerdy anyway. Because we\u2019re in Massachusetts, we\u2019ve had snowstorms before, where we\u2019ve been stuck inside for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of playing board games, watching movies, playing video games, listening to each other. There\u2019s always been a lot of that. And we do have a backyard, which isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s enough to go outside to do chalk drawings or toss the ball around.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the strangest element of all this for Faienza was the timing; it felt as if she were seeing the country through a time machine of sorts. She knew pretty early, for instance, that the coronavirus situation in China had gotten serious because an increasing amount of the news conferences she had to caption here in the states were on that subject. That led her, around the first week of March, to urge her parents to avoid taking communion at church and avoid shaking anyone\u2019s hands there. At that same time, she also told a family friend to place an order for CPAP equipment, since the parts figured to become more difficult to get as the virus continued to spread \u2014 and might possibly shut entire industries down.\n\nThat feeling of time travel grew more surreal as Faienza captioned news conferences in New York, where the virus was ravaging the state. Seeing all the steps that officials were taking there as several other states delayed or opted against implementing stay-at-home orders prompted her to worry the nation didn\u2019t grasp the seriousness of the virus, and that its transmission might not slow down in a timely fashion.\n\nFaienza\u2019s hope now is that, soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to go back in time. Then she will be able to make use of those gift cards she bought to patronize the local restaurants as we get back a semblance of what everyday American life was like before the coronavirus erased that notion for millions of people.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen. Is it ready?", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-crises-and-domestic-violence-and-what-that-could-mean-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-04T11:00:10", "title": "What We Know About Crises And Domestic Violence \u2014 And What That Could Mean For COVID-19", "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, in addition to its direct impact on people\u2019s health, has unleashed a perfect storm of conditions that may increase the rate of domestic violence. Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

According to Thursday\u2019s data release from the Department of Labor, 3.8 million more Americans filed for unemployment insurance during the week ending April 25. Although that represents the fourth consecutive week of decline in seasonally adjusted initial claims, the number remains historic. (Remember, no single week prior to March 21 had ever seen even 1 million initial claims since 1967, the earliest year that data is available from the Federal Reserve.) If we add up all of the initial claims filed since the coronavirus recession began, more than 30 million people \u2014 or nearly 19 percent of the total U.S. labor force \u2014 have filed for unemployment claims over the past month and a half.\n\nExperts have all had their eyes trained on initial unemployment claims, both because they tell us about the ongoing scale of the crisis and because they\u2019re one of the rare weekly indicators of the economy at large. Some economists think this weekly trend of massive unemployment numbers includes industries that weren\u2019t hit hard at first but are now beginning to feel the ripple effects of the recession as it spreads through the economy. \u201cJob separations will likely remain high for a while, as softer demand spills over into industries not initially directly affected by shutdowns,\u201d Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst told Reuters. (This is corroborated by sources such as the hiring site Indeed, which has consistently seen 30 to 40 percent fewer jobs posted than the norm since late March.)\n\nOf course, this week\u2019s data still includes many unemployment claims that overwhelmed state agencies were not able to process immediately after they were filed. And there are still many workers struggling week by week in industries directly affected by coronavirus shutdowns, such as in restaurants or other parts of the service sector. Several weeks ago, we pointed to research by St. Louis Fed economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro, who estimated that nearly 50 million jobs were at risk as the country tried to mitigate the virus\u2019s spread. If our current slight downward pattern of initial claims continues each week, we would reach that mark by July.\n\nBut will the numbers continue in that same pattern? One of the hallmarks of this crisis is the high number of furloughs \u2014 people who are out of work now (and therefore able to file initial claims) but who could potentially return to their jobs when the economy restarts. A recent analysis from the California Policy Lab found that 90 percent of that state\u2019s workers who filed for unemployment in early April expected to go back to their previous jobs, a much higher share than the 40 percent who gave that response in February. With many states moving toward reopening at least some businesses by next week, a large number of those who filed claims earlier in the crisis could potentially be returning to work.\n\nThat\u2019s why another important indicator will be what\u2019s called continued claims, or insured unemployment \u2014 the number of people actually receiving unemployment benefits in any given week. (According to the Department of Labor, that number was 17,992,000 for the week ending April 18.) It lags a week behind initial claims, since not all initial claimants are actually eligible to receive payments, but it gives us a faster-moving measure of where the crisis might be headed than the traditional unemployment rate, which is released each month. The decline of continued claims tends to go in lockstep with the end of recessions, and it will be important to watch how that metric changes as the restarting economy begins to go through another phase of incredible upheaval over the next month.\n\n\u2018We have a ways to go until data\u2019 allows states to reopen: Nate Silver", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-americans-who-suffered-when-the-economy-shut-down-are-also-in-more-danger-as-it-reopens/", "published": "2020-04-28T17:33:33", "title": "The Americans Who Suffered When The Economy Shut Down Are Also In More Danger As It Reopens", "text": "It\u2019s been more than six weeks since Daniel last rode his bike to his office, where he works on the business operations team at a beverage company in the Pacific Northwest. At first he was apprehensive about working from home for the indefinite future, but within a few weeks he realized he was feeling more focused and productive than ever before. Even when restrictions are lifted on companies like his, he doesn\u2019t expect to be spending a lot of time at the office. \u201cI\u2019ll go back for certain meetings if things start to reopen, but for the most part I think we\u2019re going to be remote for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel knows not everyone has that luxury. \u201cI just keep saying to myself \u2014 I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, because I\u2019ve basically been able to continue working unaffected,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the COVID-19 crisis continues, the ability to work from home could turn into one of the most important markers of privilege for American workers.\n\nAccording to a survey of 25,000 respondents fielded online April 1\u20135, more than 34 percent of people who were employed four weeks earlier reported that they used to commute to work, but were now working from home. Add that to the nearly 15 percent of respondents who said they were already working from home, and nearly half the country is teleworking.\n\nBut the ability to work remotely isn\u2019t randomly distributed \u2014 it\u2019s concentrated among people who are already more likely to have higher incomes and more stable employment.\n\nIn a recent working paper, economists Simon Mongey, Laura Pilossoph and Alex Weinberg created two metrics to understand which workers will be hit especially hard by the coronavirus crisis, using data from the Labor Department. The first measures the extent to which a given occupation can be performed from home, and the other measures the amount of close proximity to other people that the job requires. Sure enough, the jobs that are likely harder to do from home or are more likely to involve close physical proximity tend to be filled by people who are more economically vulnerable. For instance, jobs that are more difficult to work from home are disproportionately held by lower-income workers.\n\nThis research generally aligns with other recent studies that have found that the COVID-19 crisis has had a bigger economic impact on people with lower incomes and levels of education. That dynamic is now going to force many poorer Americans to choose between their safety and a paycheck as the economy starts to reopen.\n\nOne of those workers who could soon be facing that unpleasant calculus is Erica Harrison, who lost her job setting up displays at a department store in Louisiana last month. She was already struggling to live on $12 per hour, and spent the last few weeks scrambling to get her unemployment insurance payments set up so she could buy groceries and make her car payments. Now she finally has enough money to support herself \u2014 but a few days after her benefits started to arrive, her supervisor called to ask how she\u2019d feel about coming back to her job if the store was able to reopen.\n\nThe idea of returning to work knocked her back on her heels. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying thought because the risk of getting sick is so high,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job to touch everything in the store \u2014 the fixtures, the mannequins, the plexiglass.\u201d She lives with her mother, who recently recovered from heart surgery, so Harrison is especially concerned about spreading the virus to family members. But she had to take her supervisor\u2019s question seriously. She lost her health insurance along with her job, and she\u2019s wary of turning down work in the midst of a recession. And she would probably no longer qualify for unemployment benefits if she was offered her job back and chose not to return. \u201cIn my mind it pretty much comes down to: do you care more about your money or your health?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was a way for me to stay indoors and keep getting my paycheck. But that option is not available to me.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Harrison isn\u2019t simply that it\u2019s impossible to do her job from home. Her job also involves close contact with other people, putting her at higher risk for contracting or spreading the virus if she did come back to work. She isn\u2019t alone. The economists\u2019 research shows that jobs that require close physical proximity are disproportionately occupied by poorer Americans.\n\nAnd the workers who are disproportionately represented in both kinds of jobs are also more economically vulnerable. Many of the jobs where working from home is more difficult are held by workers without a college degree, and those workers are also overrepresented in jobs that require more face-to-face interaction. The same is true of lower-income workers, who make up more than half of workers in jobs where working from home is unlikely to be feasible and of jobs that involve closer proximity to other people.\n\nThis means that workers who were hit hardest by the economic shutdown are also disproportionately likely to suffer as the recovery unfolds. In places where the economy is being reopened more quickly, they\u2019ll have to confront the prospect of returning to dangerous work before the virus is fully contained. In places where economic activity is remaining frozen for longer \u2014 or only only partially resuming \u2014 they may face longer-term unemployment if their employers can\u2019t reopen quickly or fully. Unemployment benefits can be a salve, especially since the federal government temporarily boosted the amounts by $600 per week. But many Americans\u2019 benefits have not been processed. And that extra money is currently scheduled to stop at the end of July. But the economy probably won\u2019t be back to normal by then. \u201cIf the recovery begins by bringing back workers who are in jobs where they don\u2019t have a lot of contact with other people, that will mean people in high physical proximity jobs will be hurting economically for longer,\u201d Mongey said.\n\nOf course, not everyone who has transitioned to teleworking is leading a charmed life. Daniel was almost apologetic about his good fortune \u2014 he\u2019s young, with no kids and a well-paying job, leaving him plenty of time for Zoom catch-ups with friends and road biking. In some ways, his financial situation has actually improved. He and his partner are rarely ordering out for food, and he got a flood of refunds as races he\u2019d signed up to run over the next few months were canceled.\n\nBut other workers, like Kyrie Martin, a high school math teacher in California, told us they can\u2019t wait to get back to their old, analog workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s maddening enough to try to teach AP Statistics remotely without my first-grade daughter coming in and playing hangman with the students on the whiteboard behind me,\u201d Martin said. But she was quick to add how lucky she felt to still be working.\n\nAnd Martin\u2019s job as a public school teacher probably isn\u2019t in danger of disappearing. As Harrison weighed her options, she was alarmed to see reports that big department stores like Neiman Marcus have been among the first economic casualties of the economic crisis. She wonders if her employer might be next, even if it manages to reopen. \u201cIf I\u2019m questioning if it\u2019s safe to come to work for a paycheck, who\u2019s going to want to come in of their own free will to shop?\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not an irrational fear.

To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nAs 40-year-old Adam Bee approached his one-year anniversary as a New York City resident, he felt more and more confident that his decision to move there was a good one.\n\nBee had recently moved to the big city to start work as a sort of consultant, and business was taking off. He had just led a successful work retreat, and his client bookings were reaching new heights both in number and frequency. The uptick allowed the Tennessee native to rent a bigger two-bedroom apartment \u2014 which meant he could see clients from a home office \u2014 and gave him the money to finally purchase a monthly health care plan in March.\n\nBut as the novel coronavirus started to spread early that month, businesses shut down rapidly, perhaps none more rapidly than Bee\u2019s. As a sex coach \u2014 he works with individuals and couples to be more in sync sexually and spiritually \u2014 Bee saw his income dry up all at once, even before stay-at-home orders were issued for New York state.\n\nShould we sacrifice our data privacy to fight the coronavirus?\n\n\u201cIt was my decision to shut things down and cancel the remaining classes I had scheduled,\u201d said Bee, whose coaching sessions were held in person. \u201cIt just felt like the ethical thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut the hit was significant. At the peak of his success, he was bringing in between $8,000 and $12,000 a month, charging clients $3,500 for a set of five sessions. (In a global city like New York, the demand for his \u201csacred-intimacy\u201d services \u2014 and clients\u2019 ability to pay for them \u2014 was a key part of Bee\u2019s calculation to move there.) In his mind, there wasn\u2019t an immediate way to still do his work safely and in person while justifying that kind of cost, especially with other people finding themselves out of work by the millions because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI was in a complete place of fear,\u201d Bee said. \u201cFor the first two weeks of this, I just kind of stared at the wall.\u201d He gave some thought to looking for work in his previous fields \u2014 politics and marketing \u2014 before realizing that those options, too, had likely thinned considerably as a result of the cratering economy. Between the wails of ambulance sirens, he\u2019d break down in tears at times, thinking about just how dire his situation was: \u201cI was going to be homeless in a matter of days.\u201d\n\nIneligible for unemployment, Bee has done what he could do to eliminate spending. The bronze health care plan he\u2019d gotten days earlier for $476 a month with a $5,000 deductible? He scrapped it entirely and followed that up by applying for Medicaid (his application has been approved). The virus has made Bee more or less terrified of walking into a grocery store, so he limits himself to one trip every three weeks now. That has also helped him save money, though his diet these days has gotten pretty mundane, consisting mostly of grains and beans.\n\nThe biggest financial help for Bee was a $10,000 loan from a friend to cover his Upper East Side rent until his lease expires. \u201cThat was pretty fucking special,\u201d he said of his friend\u2019s generosity. Bee plans to hunt for a cheaper living situation once the lease runs out this summer.\n\nThe other bright spot has been the slight rebound in Bee\u2019s business. After those initial despondent weeks, he eventually concluded that it might be possible to do his coaching virtually, as opposed to in-person only. With that in mind, Bee spruced up his website, and by the third week of March, he began holding virtual sessions. That first week alone, he coached more than 100 people. \u201cMy web traffic is more than double what it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that things are back to how they were before. Bee is charging a mere fraction of his old rate \u2014 $750 for five sessions \u2014 so it takes him five times as many virtual bookings to make what he earned for in-person meetings. \u201cI\u2019m having to work more now than I ever have in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nBee is cautiously optimistic that his in-person clients will return once society is closer to normal again, adding to his burgeoning online business. \u201cI\u2019ve got clients in five states and a couple different countries now,\u201d he said.

After spiking to 6.9 million for the week ending on March 28, the number of new seasonally adjusted claims has gone down each successive week, though the numbers are still astronomical. About 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the past five weeks, the same number you would get if you added up the initial-claims numbers from March 14 going back to Nov. 25 \u2026 of 2017.\n\nJust to put all of this further in perspective: If the total U.S. labor force is 163 million strong, at least 16 percent of it has now lost a job since mid-March. (And that\u2019s without even accounting for the previous unemployment rate of around 3.5 percent that existed before the coronavirus really hit the U.S.) COVID-19 is creating an unemployment crisis unlike anything America has seen in a very, very long time.\n\nPerhaps that explains some of why we\u2019re beginning to see backlash against the full stay-at-home orders that have been enacted in 42 states and the District of Columbia as a means of slowing the coronavirus\u2019s spread. A number of states have seen protesters descend on their capitols to decry the lockdowns, and the governors of several states, including Georgia and South Carolina, have announced plans to reopen their economies.\n\nPublic outcry is not exactly unexpected when frustrations mount over lost wages in the middle of a national disaster. But are the protests really about unemployment and economic hardship? In some states, it would make sense \u2014 if you add up the advance unemployment claims filed in Michigan since March 15, they account for 24 percent of the state\u2019s labor force. That\u2019s a massive amount of unemployment, the likes of which would seem to be driving the anger we saw in Lansing last week. However, the relationship isn\u2019t nearly as clear-cut when you look at every state.\n\nOverall, according to news reports, there were 28 states over the past week with gatherings of at least 100 people protesting stay-at-home orders and six with at least 1,000 people, out of a possible 42 states (plus Washington, D.C.) with shelter-in-place orders. When looking at what would predict whether a locked-down state would have a protest of at least 100 people, we broke down each state based on the share of the labor force that has filed advance claims since March 15; the state\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus cases; the number of days since the state enacted the lockdown; and the party affiliation of the governor. Here are the averages in each of those categories, depending on whether the state saw a protest:\n\nProtest states have had less COVID-19 \u2014 and unemployment Economic, public-health and political averages among states (and the District of Columbia) with lockdown orders, by whether the state had an anti-lockdown protest of at least 100 people States with\u2026 Protests No Protest Count 28 15 Advance claims as share of labor force 15.0% 16.3% COVID-19 cases per million 1,933.3 2,685.0 Days since lockdown 26.5 26.9 Share w/ Democratic governors* 57.1% 60.0% *Including the mayor of Washington, D.C. Sources: Department of Labor, The New York Times\n\nNone of the differences above are statistically significant, but they do show a few interesting trends about which states have protests \u2014 and why. On average, states with protests have 28 percent fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than states without protests, which might play into a mindset that places the economic fallout of the crisis ahead of the virus\u2019s health implications. But states with protests have also seen smaller shares of their workforce file advance unemployment claims than their counterparts, which suggests that the protests are not purely economic in nature. (Although 15 percent of the labor force filing for unemployment in a five-week span is certainly not nothing.) Protest states have also been under lockdown for slightly fewer days, on average, than states without protests.\n\nPerhaps most surprising in this breakdown is that a larger share of protest states had Republican governors than the states without protests, given the perception (from states like Michigan and California) that protesters \u2014 often organized by conservative interest groups \u2014 were trying to undermine Democratic governors\u2019 stay-at-home orders. (Then again, maybe this simply speaks to a more right-leaning tendency for the populations of states that saw protests.)\n\nAs the job-loss numbers continue to pile up over the coming weeks, we may see even more people pile out of their houses to argue against the coronavirus stay-at-home orders. But the numbers above show that there\u2019s more than just economics at work behind the protests.\n\nSara Ziegler contributed research.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-is-hard-for-everyone-its-even-harder-for-parents-who-dont-make-much-money/", "published": "2020-04-23T19:59:29", "title": "This Is Hard For Everyone. It\u2019s Even Harder For Parents Who Don\u2019t Make Much Money.", "text": "The COVID-19 crisis has turned parents\u2019 lives upside down. Kids are home from school and daycare, and parents of all economic means are struggling to care for them. But while parents who are still working might be teetering between madness and exhaustion, workers who have suddenly lost jobs and income are facing a different kind of balancing act. That\u2019s particularly the case for low-wage workers. Even when the economy was good, many were already struggling with stress and financial insecurity. Now they\u2019re in an even more precarious position.\n\nA recent survey of low-wage parents gives us an unusually detailed window into the stressful new reality that some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable families are facing. Elizabeth Ananat, an economics professor at Barnard College and Anna Gassman-Pines, a public policy professor at Duke University, started the study last summer. The plan was to periodically survey the same pool of almost 700 parents who work for hourly wages in the service industry in a large U.S. city, recording the everyday pressures and anxieties that shaped low-income families\u2019 lives. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and their project took on new meaning.\n\nBy chance, one of their surveys was conducted between late February and late March, and captured the impact of last month\u2019s economic trainwreck in real time. The first inkling that something profound had changed in the survey participants\u2019 lives came in mid-March. That was right around the time that the city where they lived issued a sweeping lockdown order, closing schools and nonessential businesses. (The researchers are keeping the city anonymous to protect participants\u2019 privacy.) Two things happened almost immediately: According to a series of short daily surveys, respondents\u2019 mental health took a sudden nosedive, and so did the hours they reported having worked that day. \u201cThis is a group that\u2019s already experiencing a lot of stress, so any increase is noteworthy,\u201d Gassman-Pines said. \u201cAnd their stress and anxiety went way, way up after the nonessential businesses closed and their work hours fell.\u201d\n\nIt also exposed how quickly their financial situation could turn from precarious to untenable. In addition to their monthlong survey, Ananat and Gassman-Pines sent out a separate, one-time survey in late March to gauge in more detail how respondents were doing. Less than half of the parents surveyed said that they would get any pay for lost work, including sick leave. And more than one-third reported that their income had fallen by more than half since the crisis began. Almost half of the parents in their sample had already lost their jobs.\n\nThe research gives a rare glimpse into what happened to this group of people during the devastating two-week window in March when millions of low-wage workers abruptly lost their jobs. Most of the surveys you\u2019re used to reading about on FiveThirtyEight are designed to give a broad, comprehensive snapshot of how Americans of all stripes feel about a particular issue. But in pursuit of a result that is actually representative of the country, pollsters and researchers often sacrifice the ability to zero in on the experiences of small, highly specific slices of the population, such as the low-wage parents in Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey. Their findings are, in turn, limited in important ways \u2014 their respondents live in the same city, work in the same types of jobs (like retail, hospitality or house cleaning), and are all parents of young children. But when I talked to parents across the country who lost jobs and income as a result of the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 many of whom were already struggling financially \u2014 their stress and anxiety was palpable, and most were struggling to find any kind of support.\n\nMuch of the impact is falling on mothers like Chelsey Johnson, 27, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with her 10-year-old daughter. (Johnson was not part of the survey.) Right after she lost her job as a server and bartender at a local Creole restaurant, she tried to apply for unemployment insurance and was told she wasn\u2019t eligible because a previous employer hadn\u2019t paid into the program. She found another job, bagging and delivering lunches to local kids, but it pays less and puts her in contact with other people all day.\n\nFor women like Johnson, the COVID-19 crisis is magnifying the inequalities they already grapple with on a daily basis. According to research by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, 74 percent of parents in the country\u2019s 40 lowest-paying jobs are mothers. A survey by Lean In conducted in April found that women \u2014 particularly black women \u2014 were more worried than men about paying for basic necessities. It\u2019s no wonder that the pandemic took a greater immediate emotional toll on mothers of children under the age of 18, who were substantially more likely than fathers to say the coronavirus crisis has had a negative impact on their mental health, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in March.\n\n\u201cI just have to keep praying I don\u2019t get the virus because how else am I going to make money for my baby and me?\u201d Johnson said. Everything, she said, felt like it was falling apart \u2014 even her ability to access government resources, like food stamps, that she had gotten before. At work, while she put together lunches, she was on hold with the food stamp office for hours, trying to figure out why she hadn\u2019t received a key piece of paperwork to finish her application. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty positive person and I already knew how to shuffle my money around to make it all work \u2014 pay a little bit on my rent, my car note, try to catch up when I can,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my income is taking a hit and I\u2019m worried about getting sick. This is a whole new level of stress.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Johnson\u2019s predicament should be unusual \u2014 many states loosened restrictions on unemployment insurance to make it easier for the newly jobless to apply, and governments rushed to make other emergency services, like food pickups for kids, available to people who had suddenly lost their income. But Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey found that most people who needed these benefits weren\u2019t receiving them quickly. By the end of last month, less than half of the survey respondents who had been laid off had applied for unemployment insurance, and a tiny fraction of applicants (8 percent) had received it. And most of the parents also weren\u2019t getting the government resources that were supposed to help them feed and educate the kids who were suddenly home from school. Only about half of the parents surveyed said that their children were receiving school lessons online, and very small shares said they had accessed emergency benefits like emergency child care or grab-and-go meals.\n\nIn the weeks that have passed since the survey closed, more parents in the survey have undoubtedly started to receive other benefits. But their precarious financial position meant that every day of delay made paying bills or buying food even more difficult. In late March, some parents in the survey were already struggling to pay for essentials: About one-fifth of respondents said they would be unable to pay rent in the next month if the crisis continued. And the creaky machinery of government bureaucracy has delayed unemployment insurance payments, snarled food stamp applications and held up relief checks.\n\nEven the prospect of applying for unemployment insurance was difficult for Israel Torres, 35, a father of two who works as a culinary specialist at a university in Los Angeles. When we spoke, the university was planning to furlough its workers in a few days. (They ended up extending the deadline by a month after pressure from the workers and the union.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay calm and not make this situation stressful for the kids, but it\u2019s really hard when I\u2019m thinking all the time about what happens if I stop getting paid, how I\u2019ll cover my bills,\u201d he said. Torres and his family live paycheck to paycheck, he said, and they were already struggling because he lost his second job at a theater that closed down early in the crisis. His children were chafing at the order to stay indoors, asking their dad if they were in prison. It was difficult enough, he said, to try to keep the children entertained and engaged with their schoolwork, and avoid falling into a depression. \u201cI know I can apply for unemployment insurance if I get furloughed but I don\u2019t know how much money I\u2019d get or when it would come in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it would be too late for us.\u201d\n\nThen there are the parents who won\u2019t get any government aid at all \u2014 in particular, people who are living in the country illegally and aren\u2019t eligible for benefits. Ananat and Gassman-Pines didn\u2019t ask about immigration status in their survey, but since some estimates indicate that people living in the country illegally make up a significant chunk of the service industry, they\u2019re among the workers who have been especially hard hit.\n\nAmelia Rojas, who lives with her husband and four children in Connecticut, stopped going to her job as a housekeeper because she was worried about catching the virus and passing it to her children. Her husband doesn\u2019t have the same luxury, though \u2014 after losing his job at a restaurant, their sudden loss of income meant he had to pick up a few hours working at a landscaping firm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my husband will become infected, but we have no other choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t qualify for government help.\u201d\n\nThose twin anxieties \u2014 what would happen if her husband went to work, and what would happen if he didn\u2019t \u2014 were in Rojas\u2019s mind all the time. She described the precautions that she and her husband thought were necessary \u2014 he scrubbed himself down when he returned home from work and avoided contact with the children. \u201cBut the kids look for their dad and every time they see him, they want to be with him,\u201d she said. And even with her husband\u2019s limited income from landscaping, she was still figuring out how to pay their rent and cell phone bills. \u201cI am living with so many concerns, you have no idea.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/how-a-shortage-of-sand-and-other-common-items-could-delay-a-coronavirus-vaccine/", "published": "2020-04-21T23:44:17", "title": "How A Shortage Of Sand (And Other Common Items) Could Delay A Coronavirus Vaccine", "text": "How A Shortage Of Sand (And Other Common Items) Could Delay A Coronavirus Vaccine\n\nAs laboratories across the globe scramble to make a COVID-19 vaccine, manufacturers face shortages of common ingredients and supplies.

Last Tuesday, an International Monetary Fund report said that the world is hurtling toward the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. Economists at big investment banks have warned more or less the same: Goldman Sachs recently predicted that U.S. GDP would shrink by 34 percent in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of the year, and Morgan Stanley forecasts that this year, we could see the steepest drop in annual GDP growth since 1946.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Economists aren\u2019t especially good at predicting recessions. In this instance, with at least 20 million people out of work in the U.S. and pretty much every country suffering from the pandemic, it seems almost certain that we\u2019re in one. But forecasting the path of a recession isn\u2019t an easy task under the best of circumstances. And we are not living through the best of circumstances right now. \u201cThis is not a situation where you can push a button on the computer and out comes a number,\u201d said Jonathan Wright, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s detective work. And it will mostly be wildly wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd we also don\u2019t know how it will be wrong. The forecasters are pretty much in agreement that the next months are going to be full of economic pain \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot less consensus about how quickly the economy will bounce back. Goldman Sachs, for example, is predicting an \u201cunprecedented\u201d recovery in the second half of the year, once businesses start to reopen. The chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, meanwhile, says she\u2019s expecting a much more gradual return to positive economic growth. If anything, a recent study suggests that forecasters tend to be too optimistic about when recession recoveries will begin, which means the return to a normal economy could be slower and bumpier than many economists are currently predicting.\n\nLook at recession predictions for the past year, and you\u2019ll start to understand why some economists raise an eyebrow at some of their colleagues\u2019 efforts to play Cassandra. After a flurry of ominous warnings about an impending recession last summer, most forecasters were predicting a strong year for the U.S. economy. Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told me a story about a presentation he gave at a conference on the global economic outlook back in February. At that moment, the novel coronavirus mostly hadn\u2019t reached U.S. shores, but Daco had been keeping an eye on the virus in China and told the assembled crowd of economists that in a worst-case scenario, U.S. GDP growth could fall as low as 0 percent in 2020. Some people in the audience were not pleased. \u201cIt got back to me that they thought my estimate was way too pessimistic \u2014 there was no way we would be in an environment where the U.S. economy wouldn\u2019t grow because of the virus,\u201d Daco said.\n\n\u2018We shouldn\u2019t criticize early (COVID-19) models for seeming too pessimistic\u2019: Silver\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what two months can do. Now, with much of the global economy on lockdown, that prediction feels outlandishly optimistic. Daco\u2019s latest estimate is that the economy will contract by 4 percent over the course of 2020 \u2014 assuming a healthy rebound in the last few months of the year.\n\nLargely failing to predict the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, even when it was already wreaking havoc on one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, might seem like a huge mistake. But it\u2019s actually very normal for recessions to catch forecasters by surprise. Forecasters didn\u2019t just fail to predict the global financial crisis of 2008 \u2014 the recession had been rolling along for almost a year before it officially got the label. One study published in 2018 looked at more than 150 recessions across the globe and found that only a handful were successfully predicted by economists. Apparently, professional economic forecasters are an unusually sunny folk \u2014 or at least their predictions are. Research has found that economists consistently overestimate economic growth.\n\nAll of these challenges make sense, when you think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if recessions are black swan events and we should never be prepared for them, but it\u2019s true that they are unexpected and hard to predict,\u201d said Prakash Loungani, an economist at the IMF who studies recession predictions. Forecasting models also rely heavily on historical data, and recessions are rare. Since 1970, the U.S. has only seen seven. And the very nature of recessions make them hard to predict based on the past. \u201cNo model that\u2019s used in normal times will forecast a recession because by definition, it\u2019s a break from normal times,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, the director of macroeconomic policy at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth and a former economist with the Federal Reserve. \u201cSo you have to use your judgment and look at indicators, like the unemployment rate, for clues about what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, each recession is unique, starting with the economic conditions that triggered it. That makes relying on history an even trickier business. \u201cThe last recession was connected to a financial crisis and this one is a public health crisis,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. \u201cThis is one of the problems in forecasting recessions \u2014 the people who are experts on the issues underlying the recession this time are not necessarily the same people who were experts last time.\u201d\n\nOnce a recession begins, similar dynamics usually start to emerge \u2014 consumer confidence falls, the stock market tumbles, the unemployment rate goes up. But assumptions about how recessions will unfold or how long they\u2019ll last may not hold up from one crisis to the next, and it can be dangerous to rely on them. A recent study by Loungani found that in 436 recessions since 1990, IMF forecasters mostly predicted a rapid recovery. (Consensus forecasters had a similar track record, but Loungani had a smaller number of predictions to analyze.) In many of those recessions, to be fair, the bounce back was pretty quick. But overall, Loungani found that forecasters did not do a good job of predicting which recessions would drag on for more than a year \u2014 including the global financial crisis of 2008, where economists predicted that a recovery was coming long before indicators like the unemployment rate returned to their pre-recession levels. That misplaced optimism about a quick return to normal may have actually prolonged the recession, according to research by Loungani and others, by spurring politicians to end fiscal stimulus measures before the recovery was fully in swing.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is making economists\u2019 jobs even harder by taking some of the usual sources of uncertainty and turning them upside down. Unlike in past economic downturns, there is pretty much no debate about whether we\u2019re in a recession. That\u2019s in part because the recession was triggered by the government as it sought to respond to the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the economic problem almost immediately because the public health measures we\u2019re taking created it,\u201d Wright said. That\u2019s helpful in one sense, because it allows policymakers to respond quickly. \u201cBut it seems odd to say it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only reason we know we\u2019re in a recession so quickly is because the shock is just enormous.\u201d\n\nKnowing that we\u2019re in a recession also doesn\u2019t make forecasters\u2019 job easier. In fact, the trajectory of this crisis is even harder to predict because it\u2019s so dependent on external factors, like when shelter-in-place orders will be lifted. Wright said it\u2019s possible to get a reasonably accurate estimate of the short-term economic damage from indicators that update quickly, like weekly unemployment claims, electricity consumption or output from other sectors of the economy, such as industrial production or retail sales. But there\u2019s a lot we just don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how many small businesses will be able to reopen when the lockdowns end. Their ability to start rehiring workers will have a big impact on how quickly the economy can recover. And even rapidly updating statistics, like those unemployment claims, can\u2019t keep up with the breakneck pace of the economic crisis.\n\nDaco, whose company has started issuing biweekly forecasts for its clients, told me that he\u2019s simply expecting to be wrong a lot. \u201cAs forecasters, we have to approach this with a heavy dose of humility, because we just don\u2019t know how this will evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day we could be assuming a 10-12 week lockdown, but the next day we could be looking at a lockdown that lasts through September and you\u2019ve got to throw yesterday\u2019s assumptions out the window.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the forecasts are useless. But Sinclair told me it\u2019s better to think of them as a range of possible futures, rather than a reliable vision of what will come to be. Right now, she said, there are too many unknowns, starting with the question that\u2019s at the top of everyone\u2019s mind: When will it be safe to leave our homes again?", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-works-in-a-grocery-store-but-hes-still-losing-hours/", "published": "2020-04-20T13:40:46", "title": "He Works In A Grocery Store, But He\u2019s Still Losing Hours", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nOvernight stockers at supermarkets were among the first Americans to see how the novel coronavirus might change people\u2019s habits.\n\nCharles Rodriguez, a 26-year-old employee of a supermarket chain in the Greater San Antonio area, had an early indication. Just over a month ago, he walked out of the store to help unload the delivery truck that brought in the next day\u2019s shipment. The sight stopped him dead in his tracks. \u201cIt looked like a holiday truck,\u201d he said, filled to the brim. But it was March 12 \u2014 not Thanksgiving or Christmas.\n\nThe store was preparing for the high volume of shoppers that would flood its aisles as the virus began to shut down many aspects of American life. Still, Rodriguez and his co-workers had no clue how quickly their workload would ramp up to meet the increased demand.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nHe went from working 32 hours a week to eclipsing 40 hours, even earning some overtime pay. \u201cWe\u2019d normally unload two pallets of low-velocity items [like canned foods and peanut butter]. But then we started getting 17 pallets,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWhat was usually an eight-hour shift started becoming nine or 10 hours because of all the extra stuff.\u201d\n\nThat phenomenally busy streak for Rodriguez, who makes just over $15 an hour, went on for two weeks. But then it ended with a thud.\n\nThe supermarket chain started shifting other workers into overnight stocking, both to cut down on paying overtime and to make better use of employees in less essential departments. For instance, it\u2019s neither necessary nor safe for store employees to hand out food samples right now, so instead of laying those people off, the store has them refilling the shelves after closing. Since then, Rodriguez and many others in his department have actually lost hours.\n\nRodriguez said he appreciates his employer finding a way to avoid letting employees go, even if it means that he gets fewer hours and less pay. But it\u2019s been tough for his department. \u201cNow my shifts are closer to six hours per day, and I\u2019m losing about eight hours per week,\u201d he said. \u201cMy co-workers are hurting, and some of the original overnight stockers are kind of upset to have the extra help, because they want to hit their hours.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s only working around 24 hours per week, Rodriguez said he\u2019s been far more conscious about his spending. His lawn mower stopped working \u2014 \u201cThe grass in our yard is really starting to grow,\u201d he said \u2014 but he\u2019s holding off on buying another one as long as he can. Similarly, his 2005 Kia Optima is on its last legs and has required a few trips to the mechanic. Rodriguez and his wife, Hilary, had been saving for a more environmentally friendly vehicle, but they have decided to put off that purchase for the time being.\n\nRodriguez is fully aware of the risks involved in continuing to work as the virus spreads, and his mother is worried about him. But he\u2019s more concerned about what would happen if he lost his job: He would lose his health care coverage, which helps him pay for the medication that treats his hypothyroidism.\n\nBut Rodriguez and his wife are grateful that their situation isn\u2019t worse. They are living at the house of his father \u2014 who is in the military and is stationed elsewhere \u2014 so they aren\u2019t facing the pressure of paying a mortgage or monthly rent. And as Charles\u2019s income has decreased during the pandemic, Hilary\u2019s has increased because of it.\n\nHilary works for a grocery-delivery service, and with people increasingly reluctant to leave their homes, she is fielding almost more orders than she can handle. \u201cBefore, she was happily working 28 hours a week. Now she\u2019s at 40,\u201d and making about $17 an hour, Charles said. \u201cWe basically switched places: She\u2019s making what I got on my old paycheck, and I\u2019m now making what she did before.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to working inside a grocery store these days, it\u2019s that the couple have been able to shop for themselves before or after their shifts, rather than making separate trips to pick over whatever might be left at busier shopping times. Workers can shop before the store opens each morning by showing their employee badges. (There are still strict item limitations, though, to prevent hoarding.)\n\nRodriguez and his wife have a storage bin of essentials in their home, just in case of emergency situations like this. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t touched it yet,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, he hopes that his already-diminished hours at work won\u2019t drop any further.

In the prior week, 6.6 million Americans had filed for unemployment insurance; the week before that, it was nearly 6.9 million. But today\u2019s number still means that a previously unthinkable 22 million unemployment claims have been filed since March 15.\n\nThis decline might signal that the biggest single-week job-loss numbers are behind us, between the initial wave of layoffs and the backlog of people who were unable to file claims earlier because of overloaded state unemployment agencies. But as we noted several weeks ago, economists think there may be 25 million more Americans at risk for layoffs, based on the industries hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. So even if the peak for weekly unemployment claims is over, the chart above could end up having a long tail, depending on how long Americans have to stay inside to combat the coronavirus.\n\nSome states are at different points in that progression than others. If we look at advance claims \u2014 which are reported weekly by state but are not identical to initial claims \u2014 we find that Maine saw the biggest decline week-over-week, with 57 percent fewer claims last week than the previous week. Claims in Michigan, which had seen huge total unemployment numbers, declined by 43 percent last week, more than twice as much as the national average (-19.9 percent). A similar story can be told in some other large states, including Ohio (-30 percent), Illinois (-30 percent) and California (-29 percent).\n\nOverall, only nine states or territories saw an increase in people seeking unemployment benefits last week, including North Carolina (+0.3 percent), Florida (+7 percent) and New York (+15 percent). Colorado saw a 131 percent increase in advance claims last week, after declining by 25 percent the previous week:\n\nWhere are unemployment claims decreasing?

But it does provide another set of data points for where the biggest increases in unemployment might be happening across the country right now.\n\nSome areas of the country are bending the curve against the virus itself, which is the most important factor for reducing COVID-19\u2019s economic damage as well. But even once new cases are on the decline, the question of when \u2014 and how \u2014 to get people back to work is incredibly complicated. As we begin to move into that phase of the process, the unemployment numbers will recede, but it could be a very long time before they look normal again.\n\nIs social distancing in the US \u2018flattening the curve\u2019?", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-covid-19-is-wreaking-havoc-on-our-ability-to-make-things-including-vaccines/", "published": "2020-04-15T19:28:51", "title": "How COVID-19 Is Wreaking Havoc On Our Ability To Make Things \u2014 Including Vaccines", "text": "So far, Australia has been doing pretty well in the fight against COVID-19. Using a combination of social distancing, tight travel restrictions and contact tracing, the country has kept its death toll under 100 people and seems to be leveling off its new cases. It\u2019s even managed to avoid closing schools. But despite the relatively minor impact the novel coronavirus has had on life in Australia, medical workers are still running low on masks, gloves and gowns.\n\n\u201cSuddenly it feels like a house of cards,\u201d said Simon Quilty, senior staff specialist at Alice Springs Hospital in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite [run out of personal protective equipment], but we\u2019ve come very close to it. We don\u2019t even have the pandemic. If we do get a pandemic, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nAll around the world, whether hard-hit by the virus or not, countries are running low on crucial supplies. And while shortages are largely confined to disposable medical items for now \u2014 personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, chemicals used for COVID-19 testing \u2014 experts say other shortages are likely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is affecting the way we manufacture all sorts of products, and the way we get those products to where they\u2019re needed. People who study these supply chains have seen problems coming for years. Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/she-was-about-to-start-a-new-job-then-the-economy-collapsed/", "published": "2020-04-13T14:00:33", "title": "She Was About To Start A New Job. Then The Economy Collapsed.", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis tests almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nJust over a month ago, things were looking pretty rosy for Laura Buda. After an eight-year run at a midsize arts company, the 32-year-old marketing and communications specialist from Virginia was offered \u2014 and had accepted \u2014 a new job with a much larger organization.\n\nThe new gig would provide not only greater upward mobility for the future but also a higher salary for the present. To celebrate the change, Buda and her husband went on a brief getaway to the Blue Ridge Mountains during the 10-day gap between the final day of her previous job and the first day of her new one.\n\nBut during that hiatus in mid-March, the new coronavirus began spreading aggressively throughout America. Like everyone else, Buda saw schools and businesses shutting their doors in response. And like many other Americans, she began wondering how COVID-19 might affect her new job. Perhaps they\u2019ll push back my start date by a week, she thought, or if things get really bad, maybe a month.\n\nThen, late in the afternoon on Friday, March 20 \u2014 three days before she was slated to begin her new position \u2014 she got a phone call. A member of the company\u2019s human resources department apologized profusely but said that the organization was being forced to rescind Buda\u2019s offer because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nBuda is part of a gray area within the nation\u2019s reeling economy: those who left one job voluntarily for another \u2014 before COVID-19 spread and altered nearly everything in its path \u2014 but who never technically started working at the second gig. People like her are left in the lurch, not knowing whether they\u2019ll ultimately be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nBuda\u2019s husband, who works as an attorney for the federal government, read through the unemployment stipulations carefully and told her he wasn\u2019t sure that her unique circumstances would qualify. \u201cThey ask you to list your last job, and I had to say that I left voluntarily,\u201d said Buda, still waiting to hear back about her filing. \u201cThere\u2019s a small area there to explain your circumstances a little more. But with how many people are filing for unemployment, I\u2019m not even totally sure that part will be read through closely.\u201d\n\nIf she ends up qualifying for unemployment, she estimates that it would amount to about $1,600 per month \u2014 a little bit less than what she and her husband had been paying in child care costs for their 16-month-old son, Dominic.\n\nThere have been some silver linings for Buda and her family, however. Her son\u2019s child care facility \u2014 which has continued to operate during the pandemic \u2014 has allowed parents to pull their children out of day care without having to pay during the crisis. (Some don\u2019t allow that.) And the recent coronavirus relief legislation lets some people with federal student loans temporarily halt their payments, which will save Buda about $450 a month. Perhaps most important: Buda\u2019s husband earns enough to support the family single-handedly. But they will still need to tighten their belts to get through this period.\n\nThe past four weeks have been a whirlwind for Buda. Not long ago, she had planned to buy clothes for the new job \u2014 something her bump in pay would have comfortably allowed. But now she counts it as a blessing that she never took that step. Instead of learning the ropes at her new gig, she spends her spare time \u2014 the time her toddler allows her to have \u2014 sifting through emails notifying her of openings she might be a match for.\n\n\u201cAnytime I\u2019m on the computer, [Dominic] wants to push all the buttons,\u201d she said.\n\nBuda vacillates between looking for jobs and thinking it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand, given the state of the economy. She would love to find something in theater, a field she\u2019d worked in for a long time. But she\u2019s also looking for jobs at nonprofits; she thinks positions with organizations that are untethered to the marketplace seem far more stable now and over the long haul.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who work in industries that, when things reopen, things aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Buda said. \u201cIn theater, people aren\u2019t going to want to engage right away, even if it\u2019s deemed safe. I just think the recovery is going to be so much harder for something like that.\u201d\n\nCheck out all the latest coronavirus polling we\u2019ve collected.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-16-million-americans-have-lost-their-jobs-in-the-past-three-weeks/", "published": "2020-04-09T15:17:54", "title": "More Than 16 Million Americans Have Lost Their Jobs In The Past Three Weeks", "text": "The coronavirus\u2019s record-breaking run of bad economic news continues unabated. Thursday\u2019s numbers from the Department of Labor reported that 6.6 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance, roughly the same as last week (which was revised to 6.9 million) and about double the previous week\u2019s tally of 3.3 million.\n\nAdd it up, and over the course of three weeks, a total of 16.8 million seasonally adjusted unemployment claims have been filed. If we borrow the math from this Justin Wolfers piece in The New York Times last week, that means somewhere around 15 to 17 percent of the workforce might currently be without a job. (For comparison\u2019s sake, that number was 25 percent at the height of the Great Depression.)\n\nThe U.S. has had eight recessions since 1967, including the one we are almost certainly in right now. Of those, four (1969-70, 1980, 1990-91 and 2001) never reached our current level, over 16 million unemployment claims. For the others, it took a tremendous amount of time to reach that level: between 33 weeks (1981-82) and 51 (1973-75). Even in the Great Recession a decade ago, it took 42 weeks to get 16 million total initial claims. This time around, it has taken three.\n\nThis recession is moving at hyperspeed For U.S. recessions since 1967, number of weeks before reaching each benchmark for total initial unemployment insurance claims Weeks before no. of total initial claims Recession of \u2026 3,000,000 9,000,000 16,000,000 1969-70 13 33 Never 1973-75 11 31 51 1980 8 19 Never 1981-82 7 20 33 1990-91 8 22 Never 2001 8 23 Never 2007-09 9 26 42 2020* 1 2 3 *The current economic downturn hasn\u2019t yet met the traditional definition of a recession. Previous recessions were considered to have started midway through the month they officially began and ended midway through the month they finished. Sources: Department of Labor, St. Louis Federal Reserve, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that the U.S. population has also increased by 66 percent since 1967, meaning there are more workers to potentially file claims now. Furthermore, total initial claims are not equivalent to the number of people who are actually receiving unemployment benefits. And, of course, economists look at much more than just unemployment when determining whether a recession has happened.\n\nThat said, the sheer job-loss numbers for this recession \u2014 and the velocity at which they were amassed \u2014 are difficult to comprehend.\n\nGoing back to previous recessions, some analysts see parallels to the 1981-82 downturn. That recession is considered to have been triggered by changes in monetary policy, when former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. By comparison, this recession was triggered by widespread stay-at-home orders that effectively shuttered countless businesses and put millions out of work. (We should note that economists almost unanimously agree that this was the best decision not only for public health reasons but also for the long-term economy.) Many jobs were lost in the early 1980s, but the unemployment rate quickly dropped after the initial shock, which may provide a model for people to return to work swiftly after the coronavirus crisis lifts.\n\nAgain, though, that early 1980s recession took much longer to reach present levels of jobless claims, so in many ways our current recession represents an unprecedented situation. That\u2019s particularly true when you consider the underlying reason why people can\u2019t go back to work \u2014 a novel virus for which a vaccine is still quite far off \u2014 and the uncertainty around what its eventual timeline will end up being. One thing is for sure, however: Most of us have never seen a recession produce such extreme economic hardship, so quickly, as what the U.S. is going through right now.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}]}, "nbpostgazette": {"rss": "http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/", "link": "http://http://nbpostgazette.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/games-like-corruption-of-champions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=games-like-corruption-of-champions", "published": "2020-05-14T04:46:06", "title": "Best Games Like Corruption Of Champions (COC) You Must Play!", "text": "Best Games Like Corruption Of Champions: Corruption of Champions is basically an erotic text-based as well as a browser-based flash game.

At the time, the nation was in economic devastation after years of internal conflict, and the new president was forced to evasion on debt expenditures to European governments.\n\nIn response to that, France, Britain, and Spain sent the naval forces to Veracruz, Mexico, challenging recompense. Britain and Spain discussed with Mexico and removed their forces.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use this chance to shape a territory out of the Mexican region. Late in the year 1861, a well-armed French navy captured Veracruz, landing a great force of troops and driving President Ju\u00e1rez and his government into departure.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla\n\nCertain that accomplishment would come quickly, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to outbreak Puebla de Los Angeles which was a small town in east-central Mexico. From his new head office in the north, Ju\u00e1rez curved up a disparate force of 2,000 loyal men\u2014a lot of them either native Mexicans or else of mixed heritage and were then sent to Puebla.\n\nThe massively outstripped and below-par supplied Mexicans, headed by Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, encouraged the town and equipped for the French attack. On May 5, 1862, Lorencez assembled his army\u2014maintained by hefty weapons, before the city of Puebla and headed an attack.\n\nFacts about Cinco de Mayo\n\nCinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of the Mexican army over France at the Battle of Puebla on 5th May 1862.\n\nCinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for Mexico\u2019s Independence Day. The Independence Day of Mexico is celebrated every year on September 16 which is the most significant national holiday in Mexico, honouring the Cry of Dolores, which started the war of Mexican independence from Spain.\n\nNot all the Mexican celebrates the Cinco de Mayo, as the people in Puebla only celebrate the day. The reason behind it is that Puebla is the place where the unlikely victory was taken place, because of which the celebrations aren\u2019t countrywide. Cinco de Mayo is also not a federal holiday because of which the day is just like any other day for most people in Mexico.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla was a part of the Franco-Mexican War. One of the whys and wherefores it\u2019s so important is for the reason that the French army was much grander and more equipped than the Mexican army. They had more weapons and men at their disposal, but still after having all that the French lost the battle to Mexico.", "author": ["Prabhat Singh", "About The Author", "Prabhat Is A Consistent", "Hard Working Content Creator With Specialization In Tech", "Finance Niche.

Then, the lawmakers did not hesitate to question the move that the Trump\u2019s government made. They had their reasons, but that is a matter of another day. Is that possible to paralyze the operations of the space agency? If that becomes a reality, what is the future of NASA? How will they get past that? It is what our piece is all about. For projections, you should keep reading.\n\nDuring the hearings before the panels of Senate and House, two NASA officials came before them. First, there was the manager of NASA who is in charge of the human spaceflight activities. The other one was the inspector general of the same space agency. In addition to that, there were opinions of other experts. The topic of discussion was the fate of the ISS if the White House plan succeeds.\n\nThe proposal begged one question. Can a private company manage all that including the research facilities and the astronauts in them? As the people tried answering that, it became a debate. Points of concern are in the discussion that follows.\n\nThe demand for an orbiting laboratory for a successful commercial venture was of concern. If it was an essential facility, it was unclear as to whether it would operate without receiving any support from the government. There are other questions yet unanswered. They include the necessity of the research of Mars and Moon, whether China will benefit from the step and the feelings of other ISS\u2019s partners regarding the matter. What the cost of flights come in the 2020s is also unknown.\n\nAccording to Paul Martin, he has an answer for one of the questions. The inspector general of NASA said that there a low chance of a commercial operator to entirely manage to operate the ISS come 2025. That does not come as a surprise because the budget as of 2024 will be about $1.2 billion.\n\nTwo senators oppose that move. They are Ted Cruz as well as Bill Nelson. Supposedly, it is not the first time such a thing is happening. In the past, such an incident cost the state billions of dollars and its citizens a lot of jobs. If that lesson will hold waters or not, remain a mystery as of now.\n\nAs we wait to see what unfolds, there are things hard to ignore. For the last thirty years, NASA has invested hugely into the venture. Through design, construction, and operation, the agency has spent $100. Annually, its budget is between 3 and 4 billion dollars. There is so much at stake for a cost that little. The fate will unveil soon.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/there-could-be-a-sixth-military-branch-hints-trump-space-force/", "published": "2020-05-12T11:10:10", "title": "There could be a Sixth Military Branch Hints Trump \u2013 \u2018Space Force\u2019 \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "If Trump\u2019s words see the light of the day, the United States\u2019 security will be tighter than ever. The deduction of a possibility was after a speech. Last month, while addressing the West Point football team, he remarked a space force military branch. During that speech at the White House, he went further to express its function. Once a war would be beyond the atmosphere of the earth, the branch would be in charge of the same.\n\nBack in March while in California, the president highlighted the idea to the members of the military. It has for a long time had support from the Congress. However, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense by the name Pentagon are not for the idea. The milestone would be remarkable. Why not when that would be the first new sector since 1947 when the establishment of the Air Force took place?\n\nAccording to Trump, he was floating the idea. He said that he wasn\u2019t serious about the matter, but it was not a bad idea altogether. The need of the force is because of the enormous amount of work carried out in the space. He acknowledged that he warmly welcomes a possibility of having space corps.\n\nTerry Virts had something to comment on the matter. He said that it wouldn\u2019t mark the beginning of space operations by the military. The source is reliable because Terry once served as a commander of the International Space Station. Equally important, he was a veteran of the U.S. Air Force for three decades. What did he tell Peter O\u2019Dowd of Here & Now? Read on to find out the opinion of this legend.\n\nHis thoughts were as follows. The space department in the force is not a new thing. It is common to countries and states with a stable military, and the United States is not an exception. In the case of the United States, that happened half a century ago. Therefore, it is not about creating a military branch in space. It should be about making the existing one better and productive. In addition to that, military\u2019s organization should be in a more efficient manner.\n\nSince the Pentagon is against it, the chances of its existence are low. The Air Force is already complicated according to its secretary, Heather Wilson. This idea will only make the matter worse. On the other hand, war is taking a different shape. The next one would be in space as far as Rogers is concerned.

That will consequently reduce the cost of the launches. That is good news but not for the camp of the Ariane Group. What is the group about in the first place? The French-based team is a leading contractor for the Ariane 5 launch spacecraft. Equally important, it is working on the Ariane 6 as of now. Why is it not happy with the new development then? Read on to find out more about the situation in hand.\n\nFor years, the Ariane Group has been one of the few favorites that NASA runs to when in need. Did you know that it is the firm whose booster propelled the James Webb Space Telescope? That being a multi-billion dollar project speaks volumes. However, they are afraid that the current state would change. SpaceX is making the launch market extremely competitive, and that poses uncertainty of whether the Ariane Group will survive.\n\nIt is not alone in this. There is also Russia as well as the United Launch Alliance. Nevertheless, they are in a worse position. The reason is that they created the Ariane 6 rocket for one purpose only. They wanted an equal counterpart for the Falcon 9 rocket of SpaceX. The problem is that it is competing with a firm that has reduced the prices of the launch to about $62 million.\n\nWhy can\u2019t they go for that cost then? That is because as much as they would like to, they need to offer a price that will be 25% higher than that of SpaceX when Ariane 6 is ready. In addition to that, they will be prepared in 2020 and not earlier than that. While waiting to do so, SpaceX is through with their Falcon 9 boosters. If they were to offer relatively low prices, where would that leave the Ariane Group? The cost once they have used a Falcon 9 booster could get even less than the first one. That is much to handle.\n\nAlain Charmeau, Ariane Group\u2019s chief executive, made it clear about the frustrations are real. Now there is the United States and Europe competing for the commercial space jobs. According to Charmeau, SpaceX is already at an advantage. Therefore, it will be in a position to offer low prices. Will the Ariane Group survive with such a price margin? That is something that we can wait to see what transpires.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/jaxa-eager-to-join-with-nasa-in-step-by-step-human-space-exploration/", "published": "2020-05-12T09:10:12", "title": "JAXA Eager to join with NASA in Step by Step Human Space Exploration \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "The Japan Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) is making arrangements to expand human space abuse into profound space in collaboration with NASA.

JAXA is one of the accomplices in the NASA drove International Space station (ISS) and saw ISS as a testbed that can lead to the Moon and in the long run too, Mars.

Japan, Canada and 11 European nations working under the aegis of the European Space Agency(ESA) have come together with the United States in what is known as ISS since the program started. President Ronald Reagan guided NASA to create a space station in collaboration with different nations in his 1984 State of the Union Address. Japan, Canada, and Europe immediately showed their enthusiasm for joining. In 1988, with the consenting to of an Intergovernmental Arrangement (IGA), they formally moved toward becoming accomplices with the United States in building Space Station Freedom. In 1993, after the crumple of the Soviet Union, Russia additionally joined. The plan was changed for that, and different reasons and the program ended up known as ISS. A changed IGA was marked by every one of the nations in 1998.\n\nAmong research modules on ISS was made by Japan. (The others were given by the United States and Europe.)

JEM likewise is notable as the ISS module from which CubeSats are conveyed into space. Additionally, Japan fabricates and dispatches HTV (or Kounotori) spacecraft that convey freight to the ISS roughly once per year. It is right now building up an enhanced, less expensive adaptation, HTV-X.\n\nTalking at H2M and a workshop sorted out by JAXA\u2019s Washington office, Onishi laid out Japan\u2019s present arrangement for utilizing its involvement with Kibo and the ISS in extending human investigation of room in participation with NASA.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/cygnus-cargo-spacecraft-launched-by-antares-to-iss/", "published": "2020-05-12T08:10:10", "title": "Cygnus cargo spacecraft launched by Antares to ISS \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "On 21st May, a Cygnus cargo spacecraft was launched by an Orbital ATK Antares rocket to the International Space Station (ISS) with an objective, which might be the swan song for the organization as an independent team.\n\nThe launch program takes five minutes and gets completed when Antares get lifted from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, Wallops Islands at 4.44 am Eastern. Controllers shifted the launch from the starting to the finish of the window due to weather conditions that make the countdown progression easier.\n\nThe Cygnus spacecraft will be placed into the orbit by the rocket only in nine minutes after liftoff. Also, the twin solar arrays of this spacecraft will deploy after 60 minutes. As per the official information, the spacecraft will reach the ISS on the early morning of 24th May.\n\nAs per NASA ISS program Manager Kirk Shireman, the launch was simply excellent & amazing. He was at the post-launch briefing and also said that I am very happy with the beginning & progression of this mission.\n\nThe spacecraft carried around 7385 pounds of cargo for the International Space Station that consist of crew supplies, scientific payloads, and hardware for ISS.\n\nWhen it comes to scientific payloads, there is the Cold Atom Lab on the spacecraft. It is an experiment that utilizes lasers for slowing down the atoms before they become completely motionless. It further cooling the atoms to the temperature that will be quite low when compared to the temperature of our planet. Also, it has the Biomolecule Extraction and Sequencing Technology Experiment whose main purpose is to test the tool that makes the sequencing of DNA quite easily.\n\nAdditionally, the Cygnus will be used by NASA for testing their power to boost the orbit of the station. The major part of spacecraft will busy doing a burn late during its stay on the International Space Center and modify the orbital velocity of the station by 0.06 meters in a second.\n\nShireman also stated that the test\u2019s main purpose is to find out if the Cygnus can be utilized again to re-boost the station. He further added that it would open lots of future options for our team.\n\nIt might be the last launch for the Orbital ATK as an independent organization. Last year, Northrop Grumman announced to buy the Orbital ATK for a sum of US$ 9.2 billion.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/china-launching-relay-satellite-geared-towards-moons/", "published": "2020-05-12T07:10:10", "title": "China Launching Relay Satellite geared towards Moon\u2019s \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "China will dispatch the next piece of its goal-oriented automated lunar investigation program on Sunday (May 20). This is if all things continued as indicated by design. The nation Queqiao relay satellite is intended to lift off on a Long March 4C rocket on Sunday from the Xichang Satellite Launch Center in Sichuan Province. Queqiao will then advance toward the Earth-Moon Lagrange point 2, a steady spot that is found sixty-four thousand kilometers, which is past the lunar far side. From the roost, Queqiao will then send signs and information amongst Earth, and China is spearheading Chang\u2019e four lander-meanderer duos.\n\nThat combine will impel late in this year and endeavor to wind up the principal spacecraft ever to arrive on the most distant side of the moon. The moon is tidally bolted to the Earth meaning it will dependably demonstrate a similar face to our planet. This implies a transfer connect is exceptionally fundamental to speak with spacecraft on the far side, which would somehow need to send motions through the moon\u2019s rough mass. Queqiao will also, convey a stargazing test called the Netherlands-China Low-Frequency Explorer, which will scan for the radio signs from the Universe early days and after that portray the sunlight based breeze close to the moon among other work. Furthermore, Queqiao won\u2019t dispatch alone; the Long March 4c will likewise hang two little satellites called Longjiang-1 and Longjiang-2, which will perform radio space science research of their own.\n\nThe Chang\u2019e program has just accomplished a series of achievements. The Chang\u2019e 1 and Chang\u2019e two tests achieved lunar circle in 2007 and 2010 individually, and the Chang\u2019e three mission put a lander and meandered on the Moon\u2019s close side in late 2013. The following year, China launched Chang\u2019e 5 T1, a mission that sent an example return container to the moon and back to the earth to show the innovation expected to survive searing air passage.\n\nChina has plans to move a real lunar example return mission called Chang\u2019e 5 in the year 2019. The country likewise has objectives to put individuals on the lunar surface before the end of the year 2030. The Chang\u2019e program that was named after the Chinese goddess of the moon and \u2018Queqiao\u2019 which means bridge of magpies. This last moniker originates from a Chinese folktale.

This announcement by the NASA boss is critical as he has demonstrated his uncertainty about the human-caused environmental change before. This is the thing that has made a lot of individuals get the opportunity to scrutinize his reasonableness to lead a reality centered NASA. In the year 2013, while he was filling in as the Oklahoma Congressman, Bridenstine claimed that there was no present pattern toward an Earth-wide temperature boost.\n\nIn the current days, for example, while going to his affirmation hearings, he did accept that human movement has kept on adding to environmental change. In any case, he didn\u2019t shy of saying that people are the significant reason for every one of these happenings. While tending to chaperons at the NASA representative town corridor, he said that his reasoning had created on the subject and gave out his present convictions. He went further to state that he doesn\u2019t deny the agreement that the atmosphere is evolving. He trusted that the atmosphere was experiencing such a significant number of changes. He said that people keep on engaging in exercises that prompt the discharge of carbon dioxide that goes into the environment.\n\nIts discharge is in substantial amounts, and this goes ahead to demolish the ozone layer. He conceded that as an individual, we should take obligations regarding that. He clarified how NASA had turned out to be one office on the substance of the earth that has gotten compliments and won the trust of a lot of individuals. NASA plans to make it less demanding for some, individuals to comprehend the science in more agreeable and better approach. Bridenstine\u2019s help of environmental change investigate rather than what numerous might anticipate from the ruling presidential organization: For example, five Earth science and atmosphere missions were composed out the White House\u2019s proposed NASA spending plan in the year 2018, and a year ago President Donald Pulled the United States of America out of the world Paris Agreement to constrain environmental change.\n\nOffering answers to a particular inquiry on one of those cut atmosphere emissions, the Orbital Carbon Observatory Mission 3, Bridenstine did say that in his comprehension, the mission is still to dispatch in January 2019 after getting subsidized by Congress. Bridenstine reassured NASA workers that the office would take after the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) rules that considering environmental change is a best need \u2014 especially, diminishing \u201catmosphere vulnerability\u201d by concentrating on how connections relating to the water cycle and energy cycle influence the evolving atmosphere, and in addition take a look at the effect of environmental change on biological communities.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/exoplanet-hunter-takes-its-first-photo/", "published": "2020-05-12T05:10:12", "title": "Exoplanet Hunter takes Its first Photo. \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "The new exoplanet-chasing shuttle has been working for some time now. The Transiting Exoplanet Survey Satellite (TESS), which got propelled a month ago set for discover outsider universes orbiting stars near the sun, zoomed inside around 5,000 miles of the moon yesterday. This arrangement was planned a long time ago, and the move was intended to enable TESS to achieve its last science orbit, a long and circling way around Earth that no spacecraft has ever involved previously. This exceedingly circular circle will augment the measure of sky the shuttle can picture, enabling it to screen substantial swaths of the sky constantly\n\nTESS will perform one final engine burn on May 30 to achieve this circle, they added. The rocket is relied upon to start its two-year science mission in mid-June, in the wake of wrapping up adjustment and authorizing work with its four installed cameras. Such work is as of now in progress. TESS has snapped its first test picture with one of those cameras. The photograph, which was taken on April 26, is focused on the southern heavenly body Centaurus and shows in excess of 200,000 stars.\n\nThe edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the correct upper corner, and the brilliant star Beta Centauri is unmistakable at the lower left edge. TESS is relied upon to cover in excess of 400 fold the amount of sky as appeared in this picture with its four cameras amid its underlying two-year scan for exoplanets. A science-quality picture likewise alluded to as a \u2018first light\u2019 picture, is required to be discharged in June. TESS will correctly screen stars\u2019 shine, searching for little plunges that could be caused by outsider planets crossing the star\u2019s appearances. This travel technique has been utilized by NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope, which has found around 70 percent of the 3,700 known exoplanets to date. TESS is relied upon to coordinate or surpass Kepler\u2019s pull in absolute numbers, mission colleagues have said. Also, on the grounds that TESS will center around stars in the sun\u2019s neighborhood, space experts will have the capacity to think about a portion of these recently discovered universes top to bottom utilizing different instruments.\n\nFor instance, the NASA\u2019s $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is planned to move in 2020. Should test the climates of no less than a couple of TESS planets, searching for water vapor, oxygen, methane and different gases that can be an indication of livable condition. The Cost of TESS mission is assessed to cost around $200 million, despite the fact that, the dispatch administrations added another $87 million to that aggregate.", "author": []}]}, "insidertradings": {"rss": "https://www.insidertradings.org/feed/", "link": "https://www.insidertradings.org/", "articles": []}, "truthfulreporter": {"rss": "https://truthfulreporter.com/feed/", "link": "https://truthfulreporter.com/", "articles": []}, "highlandmirror": {"rss": "http://www.highlandmirror.com/feed/", "link": "http://www.highlandmirror.com/", "articles": []}, "thefinancialanalyst": {"rss": "https://theanalystfinancial.com/feed/", "link": "https://theanalystfinancial.com/", "articles": []}, "reportagestuff": {"rss": "http://reportagestuff.com/feed/", "link": "http://reportagestuff.com/", "articles": []}, "tokenfolks": {"rss": "https://tokenfolks.com/feed/", "link": "https://tokenfolks.com/", "articles": []}, "heraldanalyst": {"rss": "https://heraldanalyst.com/feed/", "link": "https://heraldanalyst.com/", "articles": []}, "findmarketresearch": {"rss": "https://heraldanalyst.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.findmarketresearch.org/", "articles": []}}}
