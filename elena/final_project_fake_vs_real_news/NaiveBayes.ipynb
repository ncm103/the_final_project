And thanks to you, we’ve protected our N.H.S. and saved many thousands of lives. And so, I know, you know, that it would be madness now to throw away that achievement by allowing a second spike. We must stay alert. This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week. Instead, we’re taking the first careful steps to modify our measures. And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can’t work from home — for instance, those in construction or manufacturing — should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. So you should avoid public transport if at all possible. Because we must and will maintain social distancing, and capacity will therefore be limited. So, work from home if you can. But you should go to work if you can’t work from home. And from this Wednesday, we want to encourage people to take more and even unlimited amounts of outdoor exercise. You can sit in the sun in your local park. You can drive to other destinations. You can even play sports, only with members of your own household. You must obey the rules on social distancing.\n",

      "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) — When it comes to dividends, more isn’t always better: A company isn’t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. “Higher” or “lower” for him only have meaning when comparing a company’s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +1.41% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS’s dividend yield — the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price — is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP’s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS’s is higher than HCP’s.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hidden gems from the '70s\n",
      "\n",
      "Over the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price — which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "For CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n",
      "\n",
      "To be sure, CVS’s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n",
      "\n",
      "Think before you grab those Ivy hunks\n",
      "\n",
      "So how has Wright’s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest’s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year — while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n",
      "\n",
      "That is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n",
      "\n",
      "Wright’s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n",
      "\n",
      "One popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +0.25% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow “dogs” that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, -0.94% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -0.36% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, -1.35% (4.1%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n",
      "\n",
      "The index’s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n",
      "\n",
      "Though the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +0.15% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 — nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright’s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "Note carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright’s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, +1.07% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, -0.11% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -1.00% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +2.35% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +0.43% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +2.15% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, +2.36% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, -1.91% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n",
      "\n",
      "The average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.\n",

      "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) — The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will “melt up” as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "I suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn’t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n",
      "\n",
      "Given that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks — or that they are about to increase that share.\n",
      "\n",
      "Other mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n",
      "\n",
      "Paper or plastic? Dollar bills, that is!\n",
      "\n",
      "Consider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n",
      "\n",
      "As market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash — the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history — occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors’ opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n",
      "\n",
      "Another reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, “Measuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,” published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n",
      "\n",
      "The authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months’ time.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, “Seasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,” found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months — and do just the reverse in summer.\n",
      "\n",
      "As followers of the famous “Sell in May and Go Away” seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what’s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n",
      "\n",
      "Even if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn’t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n",
      "\n",
      "In fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n",
      "\n",
      "Investors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says — especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n",
      "\n",
      "If these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: “For most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.”\n",

Demand for housing is still incredibly strong, despite the hit to the economy, and supply is at a record low. For the week ending March 9, new listings were down 29% annually, and the total supply of homes for sale was down 19%, according to realtor.com. But now new listings, along with open houses, are starting to pick up as states reopen. Selling a home is stressful enough, but selling in the age of social distancing may seem even worse, but it doesn't have to be. Simple strategies can help. First, staging the home to sell has never been more important, even if you're not letting people in.\n",

Sellers should resist the urge to save on staging now and may even want to step it up. Virtual technology is a must, and some agents are now using the latest in 3-D touring, which allows buyers to move through the home on their own.\n",

      "A rally in bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report an increased interest from institutional investors. Bitcoin crossed $10,000 on Friday morning Singapore time, the first time it has hit that price since February, according to data from CoinDesk. The cryptocurrency had pared some of those gains and was trading around $9,900.75 as of 1:39 p.m. Singapore time, still representing a more than 6.4% rise from the day before. The entire market capitalization or value of the cryptocurrency market had jumped by more than $13 billion from the day before, as of around 1:39 p.m. Singapore time. That move had been largely driven by bitcoin which makes up most of that figure. The value of the entire market stood at $268.07 billion.\n",
      "\n",
      "Industry participants said that a number of factors — from supportive central bank monetary policy to increased interest from institutional investors — has factored into the bitcoin rally. Bitcoin suffered two bouts of intense selling in March sending it to a low of around $3,867, a price not seen since March 2019. Since then, the price has rallied over 150%. Meanwhile, stock markets, which also saw sharp drops in March, have recovered. The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March low. \"Overall markets have been bullish since the March lows and this is across asset classes, including crypto,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Money printing by the Fed and other central banks globally have given a lot of confidence to investors that the economy will be supported no matter what.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.\n",

      "The 'halving'\n",
      "\n",
      "Part of the rise in bitcoin's price since the March low has been anticipation of a technical event known as \"halving.\" Bitcoin is not issued by a centralized authority like fiat currencies are. That is why it is often called a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency. Instead it is governed by code and is underpinned by a technology known as blockchain. In the world of bitcoin, so-called miners with specialized high-powered computers compete with each other to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever \"wins\" this race gets rewarded in newly minted bitcoin. This \"mining\" activity happens in blocks, which is essentially a group of transactions joined into one. Currently, these miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per block mined. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. On May 12, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoin. The effect is that the supply of bitcoin coming onto the market is reduced. Previous halving events, which happen every four years, have preceded big price increases in bitcoin.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"For the past few weeks, we have seen additional players enter the BTC market as prices have trended upward in anticipation of the halving event as bulls saw this as an opportunity to buy BTC ahead of a price pop and what many expect will be significant price appreciation,\" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a bitcoin index fund provider, told CNBC. BTC refers to bitcoin's currency code like USD for the U.S. dollar. \"This has undoubtedly continued into this week and may even carry over the weekend as the halving draws closer.\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Institutional buying?\n",
      "\n",
      "Dibb said there are other factors at play as well, including more institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, a high-profile Wall Street hedge fund manager, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. \"The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin—publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC's sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone,\" Dibb said. \"With monetary easing policies and 'unlimited' economic stimuli being recently unveiled across the world, fiat currencies seem set to weaken substantially. This has, in turn, led to bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' to gain added traction amongst investors who are seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets.\" Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a so-called safe haven asset during turbulent times for other risky assets like stock markets. However, recently, bitcoin has fallen and risen when stock markets have.\n",

      "Police are braced for an explosion of violent crime as gang rivalries and vendettas that have built up during the lockdown erupt onto the streets following the easing of restrictions, analysis by a leading criminologist warns.\n",
      "\n",
      "Dr Simon Harding, director of the National Centre for Gang Research at the University of West London, said the trading of social media taunts and drug feuds that have festered during the restrictions were likely to trigger an “explosive crimewave”.\n",
      "\n",
      "During the lockdown some gangs expanded their county lines operations and seized rival areas, escalating tensions with competitors who obeyed the government’s stay home measures and suspended trading.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harding, a former Home Office and Metropolitan police adviser, said: “We’re going to have the backwash of everything that’s happened over the last two months. There’s a crimewave coming, a tsunami on the way.\n",
      "\n",
      "“There’ll be increased rivalry and competition but there will be some amalgamation among county lines gangs, some will join as a business arrangement. It’s been a major shake-up, there will be winners and losers.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Fearing arise in attacks, the Met last week launched 12 new “violence suppression units” across the capital and identified 250 “micro-hotspots” as flash points. In addition, 1,000 of London’s most prolific violent offenders are being targeted by the force in an initiative to reduce stabbings.\n",
      "\n",
      "Although recorded violence fell significantly during the lockdown, a number of incidents since Boris Johnson announced an easing of measures last Sunday suggest old tensions have resurfaced.\n",
      "\n",
      "Last Wednesday, a 19-year-old was stabbed to death in Southwark, south London following a “large fight”. The following day, coordinated “violence suppression activity” saw police arrest 70 criminals who had used the UK’s road network during the lockdown.\n",
      "\n",
      "Outside London, some forces have predicted a return to gang tensions. In Birmingham, there have been warnings of a potential rise in violence after rival groups recruited “low-performing” children while out of school and are now preparing to exploit rising numbers of unemployed youngsters.\n",
      "\n",
      "Harding also warned that the increasing normality of face masks would assist rising levels of street crime, particularly robberies. “We are now in a position where legally and socially they can be masked up. Two months ago if someone approached me with a mask I’d either run or evade them somehow. Now that’s not going to happen.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harding, whose book County Lines was published this month, said the criminal business model, in which young and vulnerable people were used as couriers to move drugs and cash between cities and smaller towns, was constantly evolving.\n",
      "\n",
      "Gangs in London, he said, had responded to the risk of being charged for trafficking offences when exploiting youngsters as “runners”. Instead they had begun recruiting drug users and in some instances had enticed them, rather than their own members, to inflict violence on rivals.\n",
      "\n",
      "“As well as child exploitation we are now seeing exploitation of vulnerable drug users. Some are being used as proxies to commit violence. If I’m a county lines manager and I want somebody taught a lesson then rather than send a boy I can just give two bags of brown to a heroin user to stab them. It’s horrible and manipulative.”\n",
      "\n",
      "Harding’s book details a series of phenomena about county lines including how disciplined London gangs deal in “asymmetric retaliation”, subduing provincial rivals with ferocious acts of violence.\n",
      "\n",
      "One county lines manager Harding interviewed claimed to be making £1,000 a day. A Lamborghini sports car worth £100,000 was among items seized last week by police targeting county lines dealers in the south of the capital.\n",

At the time they are created, they seem risky and sometimes dumb. Are Google and Apple inherently good names, or do they have the benefit of a rosy rear view? Probably the latter.\n",

      "Terrible timing has certainly contributed to a difficult start for the Jeffrey Katzenberg-founded mobile-video platform, which launched earlier this spring. Still, maybe it isn’t just the timing. Maybe they made bad decisions. Maybe the product doesn’t fit. A name should be judged based on how well it matches the company’s criteria, not on public perception. Because, as mentioned, success shades how we perceive the company, not the strength of the name.

      "A company that raises nearly $2 billion should plan for success. They certainly planned a naming strategy with that in mind. The criteria assumed rapid adoption in the U.S. and quick adoption abroad. Quibi is purpose-built for travel. It feels familiar in the UK with its close tie to the slangy quid. You can imagine the French embracing it as \"Kee-bee,\" similar to Quebec. It is at home in Arabic and Hindi. The alternating consonant/vowel, consonant/vowel construction is reminiscent of one of the most well-traveled brands, Coca-Cola.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, those positives aren’t positive in the current light. If the naming strategy assumes rapid usage in the U.S. and that doesn’t happen, the international flair puts up barriers to a skeptical stateside audience with more time on their hands than usual. The primary obstacle is unclear pronunciation.\n",

      "We have all been in a bar and become interested in an exotic beer, only to order the IPA because we didn’t know how to pronounce the other one. Same with a dish in a restaurant or an author in a bookstore. People, in general, don’t like to look stupid, and few things make you feel as stupid as saying something incorrectly.\n",
      "\n",
      "There are a couple of ambiguous points in Quibi. I mispronounced it before I heard someone say it. Rhyme is one of the factors that improve memorability in a word; maybe I was trying to force it into the name. Also, the decision to end the name in \"-i\" rather than \"-y\" makes the word look more French. I found myself saying \"Kee-bee\" as I was reading to myself. It feels more snappy, more energetic and in-line with quick snippets of content.\n",
      "\n",
      "The second hangup is with the tagline. Currently, it reads: “Quick bites. Big stories.” That leads you to think the name is a blend of the words quick and bite. But, as the reader, you quickly reconsider this because pronouncing it \"Kwi-bye\" doesn’t seem right. It doesn’t feel or look right, and you are left a little confused. If you combine quick and big, you get closer to the right pronunciation, but quick and big aren’t as meaningful as quick and bite.\n",
      "\n",
      "I will admit to Googling the name to figure out its pronunciation. There were several videos, which probably isn’t a good sign. The name is intended to be pronounced like \"Quimby\" without the -m, which is the last point of confusion. With this pronunciation, you would expect the more standard English spelling of Quiby.\n",

If Quibi can overcome launching in a pandemic by providing users with great content, and assuming it can move quickly abroad, then I think we will all be looking back in 10 years thinking: “Damn, Quibi is a really great name.” If not, I am afraid it will end up with the Nova in the dustbin of misunderstood and misremembered names that we don’t like because the product didn’t live up to our expectations.\n",

      "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NASA on Friday set the stage for a global debate over the basic principles governing how humans will live and work on the moon, as it released the main tenets of an international pact for moon exploration called the Artemis Accords.\n",
      "\n",
      "FILE PHOTO: The full moon, also known as the Supermoon or Flower Moon, rises above the Statue of Liberty, as seen from Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S., May 7, 2020. REUTERS/Brendan McDermid/File Photo\n",
      "\n",
      "The accords seek to establish ‘safety zones’ that would surround future moon bases to prevent what the U.S. National Aeronautics and Space Administration called “harmful interference” from rival countries or companies operating in close proximity.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would also permit companies to own the lunar resources they mine, a crucial element in allowing NASA contractors to convert the moon’s water ice for rocket fuel or mine lunar minerals to construct landing pads.\n",
      "\n",
      "The accords are a key part of NASA’s effort to court allies around its plan to build a long-term presence on the lunar surface under its Artemis moon program.\n",
      "\n",
      "“What we’re doing is we are implementing the Outer Space Treaty with the Artemis Accords,” NASA administrator Jim Bridenstine told Reuters, referring to a 1967 international pact that emphasizes that space should be used for peaceful rather than military uses.\n",
      "\n",
      "The framework will be used as an incentive for nations to adhere to U.S. norms of behavior in space, he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "“It applies to low Earth orbit, it applies to the moon as well,” Bridenstine said. The accords also require countries to adopt standards of the United Nations Space Debris Mitigation Guidelines — which govern the prevention of hazardous space debris — and the Registration Convention, which would require countries to provide orbital details of their “space objects.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The U.S. Congress passed a law in 2015 allowing companies to own the resources they mine in outer space, but no such laws exist in the international community. The Artemis Accords, consistent with the Trump administration’s space policy, appear to clear the way for companies to mine the moon under international law and urge countries to enact similar national laws that would bind their private sector’s space operations.\n",
      "\n",
      "“Why would private companies take the risk of going to mine resources if the legal situation was they could be kept from owning them?” Lori Garver, former deputy administrator of NASA, said to Reuters. “So anything this does to clear any of that up could really help advance progress in space development.”\n",

      "CHINA AND RUSSIA\n",
      "\n",
      "Reuters reported earlier this month that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was drawing up the Artemis Accords.\n",
      "\n",
      "In response, Russia’s space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin criticized Washington for excluding Russia from early negotiations over the space exploration pact, drawing parallels with U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.\n",
      "\n",
      "“The principle of invasion is the same, whether it be the Moon or Iraq. The creation of a ‘coalition of the willing’ is initiated,” Rogozin wrote on Twitter. “Only Iraq or Afghanistan will come out of this.”\n",
      "\n",
      "China said it was willing to cooperate with all parties on lunar exploration “to make a greater contribution in building a community with shared future for mankind,” a spokesperson for China’s foreign ministry said in a statement faxed to Reuters.\n",
      "\n",
      "The safety zones — while intended to encourage coordination — have prompted questions on whether the accords align with the Outer Space Treaty, which states the moon and other celestial bodies are “not subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.”\n",
      "\n",
      "The size of the safety zones would vary depending on the nature of the site they surround and would not constitute appropriation, Bridenstine said.\n",
      "\n",
      "They would follow the principle that “basically says I’m gonna stay out of your way, you’re gonna stay out of my way, and we can all operate in this space,” he added.\n",
      "\n",
      "However, there is a question over who determines the sizes of the safety zones, said Ram Jakhu, associate professor at McGill University’s Institute of Air and Space Law in Canada. “Safety zones are necessary, but they can also be abused in a way that it may become appropriation.”\n",

      "(Reuters) - The last “supermoon” of 2020 rose in the night sky on Thursday over a world beginning to re-emerge after weeks of coronavirus-related lockdowns.\n",

      "The supermoon phenomenon occurs when the moon is within 10% of its closest distance to the Earth at the full moon. May’s full moon - at the height of the Northern Hemisphere spring - is also called a “flower moon” - hence Thursday’s “full-flower supermoon.”\n",

      "A team of researchers at McMaster University has developed a reliable and accurate blood test to track individual fat intake, a tool that could guide public health policy on healthy eating.\n",
      "\n",
      "Establishing reliable guidelines has been a significant challenge for nutritional epidemiologists until now, because they have to rely on study participants faithfully recording their own consumption, creating results that are prone to human error and selective reporting, particularly when in the case of high-fat diets.\n",
      "\n",
      "For the study, published in the Journal of Lipid Research, chemists developed a test, which detects specific non-esterified fatty acids (NEFAs), a type of circulating free fatty acid that can be measured using a small volume of blood sample.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Epidemiologists need better ways to reliably assess dietary intake when developing nutritional recommendations,\" says Philip Britz-McKibbin, professor in the Department of Chemistry & Chemical Biology at McMaster University and lead author of the study.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"The food we consume is highly complex and difficult to measure when relying on self-reporting or memory recall, particularly in the case of dietary fats. There are thousands of chemicals that we are exposed to in foods, both processed and natural,\" he says.\n",
      "\n",
      "The study was a combination of two research projects Britz-McKibbin conducted with Sonia Anand in the Department of Medicine and Stuart Phillips in the Department of Kinesiology.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers first assessed the habitual diet of pregnant women in their second trimester, an important development stage for the fetus. The women, some of whom were taking omega-3 fish oil supplements, were asked to report on their average consumption of oily fish and full-fat dairy and were then tested with the new technology. Their study also monitored changes in omega-3 NEFAs in women following high-dose omega-3 fish oil supplementation as compared to a placebo.\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers were able to prove that certain blood NEFAs closely matched the diets and/or supplements the women had reported, suggesting the dietary biomarkers may serve as an objective tool for assessment of fat intake.\n",
      "\n",
      "\"Fat intake is among the most controversial aspects of nutritional public health policies given previously flawed low-fat diet recommendations, and the growing popularity of low-carb/high-fat ketogenic based diets\" says Britz-McKibbin. \"If we can measure it reliably, we can begin to study such questions as: Should pregnant women take fish oil? Are women deficient in certain dietary fats? Does a certain diet or supplement lead to better health outcomes for their babies?\"\n",
      "\n",
      "Researchers plan to study what impact NEFAs and other metabolites associated with dietary exposures during pregnancy, might have on childhood health outcomes in relation to the obesity, metabolic syndrome and chronic disease risk later in life.\n",
