And I think we\u2019re going to have a phenomenal next year.\u201d \u201cWhen you say Dr. Fauci is playing both sides, are you suggesting that the advice he\u2019s giving to you is \u2014\u201d \u201cI was surprised by his answer actually, because, you know, it\u2019s just, to me it\u2019s not an acceptable answer, especially when it comes to schools. The only thing that would be acceptable, as I said, is professors, teachers, et cetera over a certain age \u2014 I think they ought to take it easy for another few weeks, five weeks, four weeks, who knows? Our country\u2019s got to get back and it\u2019s got to get back as soon as possible. And I don\u2019t consider our country coming back if the schools are closed. And it\u2019s had very little, very unusual situation, it\u2019s had very little impact on young people. And I would strongly say they should open. It\u2019s up to the governors. It\u2019s the governors\u2019 choice, but their state is not open if the schools aren\u2019t open.\u201d", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/13/climate/environment-sensor-technology.html", "published": "2020-05-14T21:13:49", "title": "Helping the Environment, One Small Sensor at a Time", "text": "One of the sensors.

The battle continues and we must, but we are more prepared. We need to stay vigilant with social distancing, it remains an imperative. We are a resilient nation and I am confident that we will emerge from this pandemic stronger together.\u201d \u201cDo we have the coronavirus contained?\u201d \u201cRight now, it depends on what you mean by containment. If you think that we have it completely under control, we don\u2019t. I mean, if you look at the dynamics of the outbreak we are seeing a diminution of hospitalizations and infections in some places such as in New York City, which has plateaued and started to come down \u2014 New Orleans \u2014 but in other parts of the country, we are seeing spikes. So I think we\u2019re going in the right direction, but the right direction does not mean we have by any means total control of this outbreak.\u201d \u201cIf we don\u2019t do better on testing, on contact tracing and on social distancing, will deaths from coronavirus necessarily increase?\u201d Of course, if you do not do an adequate response we will have the deleterious consequence of more infections and more deaths. If we do not respond in an adequate way when the fall comes, given that it is without a doubt that there will be infections that will be in the community, then we run the risk of having a resurgence. I would hope by that point in time in the fall that we have more than enough to respond adequately. But if we don\u2019t, there will be problems.\u201d \u201cI think you\u2019re all noble public servants, but I worry that you\u2019re trying to have it both ways. You say the states shouldn\u2019t open too early, but then you don\u2019t give us the resources to succeed. You work for a president who is frankly undermining our efforts to comply with the guidance that you\u2019ve given us. And then the guidance that you have provided is criminally vague. Obviously the plan to reopen America was meant to be followed by more detailed, nuanced guidance. Why didn\u2019t this plan get released? And if it is just being reviewed, when is it going to be released?\u201d \u201cWe have generated a series of guidances as you know. And this outbreak response has evolved from the C.D.C. to an all of government response. As we work through the guidances, a number of them go for interagency review and get every agency input to make sure that these guidances are more broadly applicable for different parts of our society. The guidances that you\u2019ve talked about have gone through that interagency review, their comments that have come back to C.D.C., and I anticipate they\u2019ll go back up into the task force for final review.\u201d \u201cBut we\u2019re reopening in Connecticut in five days, in 10 days. This guidance isn\u2019t going to be useful to us in two weeks. So is it this week, is it next week, when are we going to get this expertise from the federal government?\u201d \u201cI do anticipate this broader guidance, though, to be posted on the C.D.C. website soon. I can\u2019t tell you \u2014 soon \u2014 but I can tell you your state can reach out to C.D.C., and we\u2019ll give guidance directly to anyone in your state on any circumstance that your state desires guidance from.\u201d \u201cSoon, isn\u2019t terribly helpful. Thank you, Mr. Chairman.\u201d \u201cI think the one size fits all that we\u2019re going to do a national strategy, and nobody is going to go to school, is kind of ridiculous. We really ought to be doing it school district by school district. So I think we ought to have a little bit of humility in our belief that we know what\u2019s best for the economy. And as much as I respect you Dr. Fauci, I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the end all. I don\u2019t think you\u2019re the one person that gets to make a decision. We can listen to your advice, but there are people on the other side saying there\u2019s not going to be a surge.\u201d \u201cI have never made myself out to be the end all and only voice in this. I\u2019m a scientist, a physician and a public health official. I give advice according to the best scientific evidence. There are a number of other people who come into that, and give advice that are more related to the things that you spoke about \u2014 the need to get the country back open again and economically. I don\u2019t give advice about economic things. I don\u2019t give advice about anything other than public health. So I want to respond to that. The second thing is that you used the words, \u2018we should be humble about what we don\u2019t know.\u2019 And I think that falls under the fact that we don\u2019t know everything about this virus, and we really better be very careful, particularly when it comes to children because the more and more we learn, we\u2019re seeing things about what this virus can do that we didn\u2019t see from the studies in China or in Europe. For example, right now children presenting with Covid-16 \u2014 Covid-19 \u2014 who actually have a very strange inflammatory syndrome, very similar to Kawasaki Syndrome. I think we\u2019ve got to be careful if we are not cavalier in thinking that children are completely immune to the deleterious effects. So again, you\u2019re right in the numbers that children in general do much, much better than adults and the elderly, and particularly those with underlying conditions. But I am very careful, and hopefully humble, in knowing that I don\u2019t know everything about this disease.

Why the country that was the most skeptical of the virus may be the slowest to reopen. Mark Landler on the situation in Britain. It\u2019s Tuesday, May 12. Mark, how would you describe Boris Johnson\u2019s original approach to the coronavirus?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell I\u2019d say initially, he was really kind of out to lunch on it. You know, remember, the earliest days of the virus in late January, early February coincided with Britain formally leaving the European Union.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.\n\nmark landler\n\nIn those early days, Johnson was really very preoccupied and distracted by the milestone of Brexit.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success. And whatever the bumps in the road ahead, I know that we will succeed.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo there were several very key early meetings of his cabinet that he didn\u2019t attend, where the subject of the virus came up. And then even when you began to see the first cases in Britain, and it became clear that Britain also faced a major risk, he affected an air of nonchalance.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe even sort of made light of some of the caution of the scientists. There was a very early press conference on March 3 where he made a point of saying he\u2019d visited coronavirus patients at a hospital, and he went around and shook all their hands.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I was at a hospital the other night where \u2014 I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you\u2019ll be pleased to know. And I continue to shake hands and I think it\u2019s very important that we \u2014 people obviously can make up their own minds, I think \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then, as if seeking validation, he turned to the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, who was standing next to him \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I think the scientific evidence is \u2014 well, I\u2019ll hand it over to the experts.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd the scientific advisor was shaking his head with pursed lips.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But our judgement is wash. Washing your hands is the crucial thing.\n\nmark landler\n\nThis is a guy who has his own way of living, and very much a live-and-let-live philosophy, and I think he brought an element of that to the early days of this crisis.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, there are obvious ways in which the story you\u2019re describing echoes what we saw here in the U.S., and with President Trump\u2019s initial response to the coronavirus. Having covered both our White House and now Downing Street, are there notable differences in the way the two countries and the two governments responded to their leaders dismissing the severity of the situation?\n\nmark landler\n\nOh, yeah. I think there are stark differences. And I would group them in a couple of categories. First, in the United States, you obviously have independent minded governors who chose to respond to the crisis for their own states, regardless of what President Trump\u2019s decisions and signals were on the federal level. You don\u2019t have that here in Britain. Here, Downing Street, the rime minister, really sets the policy for the whole country. So that\u2019s one obvious difference. I think somewhat more subtly is the role of the scientific community. In the United States, you had the C.D.C., Dr. Anthony Fauci and others very quickly and urgently calling for a very rigorous response for lockdowns. Here, on the other hand, you had a scientific community that took a slightly maverick initial response to this virus. There were very prominent scientists who advised the government who were arguing that maybe the best way to deal with the virus is to let it rip through the population, to let the population develop what they call herd immunity. And that that would build up a natural immunity that would make Britain more resilient to subsequent potential waves of infection. So this was an idea that was circulating in the scientific community in those early weeks \u2014 late February, early March \u2014 and it, to some extent, also informed where Boris Johnson was coming down on these issues. Unlike in the United States, where Donald Trump has blown hot and cold on his scientific advisors, Boris Johnson has said from the very start, I will be guided by the science. The wrinkle is that in those early days, the science was also calling for a more casual reaction. And that\u2019s what you saw in the first two weeks of March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating. So given that, what ends up being the official approach to this in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, in the second week of March \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you very much for coming.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson has a daily news conference, very similar to what you saw in the White House with President Trump.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We\u2019ve done what can be done to contain this disease.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd at that news conference, he begins to urge a very mild form of social distancing.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We are considering the question of banning major public events, such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that this banning such events will have little effect on the spread.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut he\u2019s stopping well short of asking people to quarantine themselves in their houses, closing restaurants, closing bars. All of things, by the way, that are being done by France, by parts of Germany, by Spain, by Italy. So at that point, Britain is a clear outrider, and you\u2019re really seeing the British go off in a very different direction that is really very striking, and beginning to draw notice all over Europe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm hmm.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then on March 16, Imperial College, which is one of the leading institutions in Britain that studies infectious diseases, published a report that changed everything. The headline of the report was basically that if the British government allowed the virus to spread through the population unchecked, it risked anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 fatalities.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmark landler\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this report was written by an epidemiologist called Neil Ferguson. He\u2019s probably the leading figure on epidemics and infectious disease in this country, and his reports and his pronouncements have almost a sort of a holy writ quality to them. He\u2019s really viewed as something of an oracle in this area. And the report essentially terrified everyone inside the British government. And you could almost see the change in the thinking take shape over the subsequent days as Boris Johnson continued to appear on television, each day looking a little more rattled, a little more anxious. And then finally on Monday, March 23 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good evening. The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.\n\nmark landler\n\nJohnson addressed the nation at around 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction: You must stay at home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. If you don\u2019t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo you now finally had Britain in alignment with Italy, with Spain, with France, in a total lockdown.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut it was at least a week to 10 days later than those other countries had acted, so in essence, Britain lost some valuable days. And sure enough, events began to vindicate that very dark picture.\n\narchived recording Some breaking news coming into us from NHS England, and it is an update of some of the numbers of those who have sadly died.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe death toll begins mounting. The hospitals begin filling up. And in fact, and most dramatically, perhaps, the virus actually makes its way into the political establishment of the government.\n\narchived recording Now proof that the virus can affect anyone came earlier on Wednesday, when it was confirmed \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nThe first dramatic moment comes when Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, announces that he\u2019s tested positive.\n\narchived recording He has been displaying mild symptoms, but otherwise remains in good health, and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\n\nmark landler\n\nA few days later, you begin hearing that senior officials in the government are testing positive. The health secretary, the man most directly responsible for leading the response to the crisis, has to quarantine himself. He has symptoms. The chief medical officer is quarantining himself. He has symptoms. And then on March 27 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Hi, folks. I want to bring you up to speed with something that\u2019s happening today, which is that I\u2019ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That\u2019s to say, a temperature and a persistent cough.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson announces to the British public that he has tested positive for coronavirus and will be going into isolation.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight back against coronavirus. And I want to thank \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nSo what you see in that first week is Boris Johnson recording videos in which he says, I\u2019m still at the helm, I\u2019m still directing policy. He runs several crisis meetings from his apartment adjacent to 10 Downing Street. So he\u2019s isolated, but he\u2019s in command. That\u2019s the very reassuring message that he\u2019s trying to send. But then you arrive at an important weekend, the weekend of April 5, when Queen Elizabeth is going to address the nation on this national challenge of the pandemic. And she\u2019s delivered a handful of such addresses in her 68-year reign, so this is a very big, historic moment for the country.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) I\u2019m speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe addresses the nation early in the evening.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe finishes her address \u2014\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd about an hour later, Downing Street puts out a press release saying Boris Johnson has entered the hospital.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Mark, what happens once Boris Johnson enters the hospital?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, the first thing that happens is there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty over who would actually run the government were he to be incapacitated for a long time, or God forbid, not come back at all. Britain, unlike the United States, doesn\u2019t have a clear line of succession for the head of the government. But then you kind of enter this very unsettling period where the government is continuing to put out reassuring press releases. They invariably say the prime minister is in, quote, \u201cgood spirits.\u201d But his top aides acknowledge that no one\u2019s talked to him for several days. His doctors are not releasing any status reports on his condition. And there starts to be this undercurrent of worry in the country that things are actually maybe worse than we think. And then sure enough, a few days later comes the really alarming news \u2014\n\narchived recording (dominic raab) During the course of this afternoon, the prime minister\u2019s condition worsened, and on the advice of the medical team, he was moved into a critical care unit.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe\u2019s actually been admitted to the intensive care unit. Statistically, the odds of patients decline rapidly when they go into the I.C.U. And so there is a sense, a real sense, that Boris Johnson may not make it.\n\narchived recording 1 This is obviously an extremely serious situation. I mean, how worried should people be about his health and about who\u2019s in charge of the government? archived recording 2 Well, the government\u2019s business will continue. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure, the prime minister\u2019s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut then there\u2019s sort of good news.\n\narchived recording We got this statement from 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\n\nmark landler\n\nYou start to hear better things. He\u2019s beginning to walk around a bit, he\u2019s beginning to read some briefing papers. And then on Easter Sunday, of all days \u2014\n\narchived recording The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now been discharged from hospital as he continues his recovery from Covid-19.\n\nmark landler\n\nWe get the news that Boris Johnson has been discharged from the hospital. And of course, the timing occasions some classic British humor. Senior government officials are heard saying to each other, he has risen, and referring to Boris as the Messiah. And for the country, the moment of peak anxiety, the moment where they genuinely thought they might have lost their leader, has passed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, I\u2019m curious how Brits responded to all of this. I could see this being an obvious moment for the British people to turn on Boris Johnson. He was slow to act, he took risks, he was pretty dismissive of the coronavirus. It would be easy to see all of this as the actions of an irresponsible leader that almost cost him his own life, and deprived the country of its prime minister.\n\nmark landler\n\nThat\u2019s a very plausible assumption to make. But oddly, it isn\u2019t the way it played out. And I think the reason it is isn\u2019t has to do with the rather clever way that Boris Johnson handled his own illness.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon. I have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS has saved my life. No question.\n\nmark landler\n\nOn the day he was released from the hospital, he recorded this very heartfelt video, in which he thanked the doctors and nurses at the hospital for saving his life.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I\u2019m going to forget some names, so please forgive me. But I want to thank Po Ling and Shannon and Emily and Angel and Connie and Becky and Rachael and Nicky \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nHe singled out two of the nurses \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Jenny from New Zealand \u2014 Invercargill, on the South Island, to be exact \u2014 and Luis from Portugal near Porto.\n\nmark landler\n\n\u2014 who kept a vigil at his bedside all night long, giving him oxygen.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) For every second of the night, they were watching, and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe NHS in this country is a revered institution, and so Boris Johnson very much tied himself to that institution and made his own personal story part of a broader narrative. And in so doing, he kept the support of the public far from turning on him, far from telling him you got what you deserved. I think a lot of people in this country were sympathetic to him, and it\u2019s really all the more remarkable when you consider that in the days and weeks since he left the hospital, the death toll from coronavirus in this country has continued to spiral upward. And as of a week ago or so, Britain now has the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe, and the second largest number of deaths of any country in the world, after the United States. And yet, even with that tragic human cost of this virus, Boris Johnson and his government retain the support of something like 51 percent , 52 percent of the people who approve of the way that they\u2019ve handled this virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mark, where are we right now in Britain? I mean, we\u2019re watching the world \u2014 Europe in particular \u2014 start to figure out what reopening is supposed to look like. Given this up-and-down history that you just recounted, what are you seeing that look like in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, so Britain is facing this increasing pressure to restart its economy, to ease the lockdown, to try to bring society back to some level of normalcy. And you\u2019re beginning to see the Italians, the Spanish, the Germans lift their lockdown. Britain reaches that same moment, and Boris Johnson announces he\u2019s going to give a speech to the nation in which he\u2019s going to lay out a roadmap. And there\u2019s a tremendous burst of hope that we are at the end of this difficult period. Some of the tabloids talk about the end of the lockdown, and the happy days that lie ahead. And so on Sunday night \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2014 your freedom.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson does appear and he delivers this fairly detailed speech.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) So I want to provide, tonight, for you, the shape of a plan, both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a roadmap for reopening society.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe lays out all sorts of benchmarks and criterias.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance, those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. In step two, at the earliest, by June the first, after half term, we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut when you actually go back and read his words \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And step three, at the earliest by July, and subject to all these conditions and further the scientific advice \u2014 if and only if the numbers support it \u2014 we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they\u2019re safe and enforce social distancing.\n\nmark landler\n\nReally, nothing much has changed. He\u2019s given a very dramatic speech in which he has barely budged the policy.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And so, no. This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. So his speech about reopening is really about how Britain is not about to truly reopen.\n\nmark landler\n\nYes. This turns out to be a speech that, when you really analyze it, is about why we are going to continue to live under a lockdown \u2014 one that might be tweaked at the edges here and there, there might be slight shifts \u2014 but fundamentally, nothing is changing in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s kind of remarkable how everything is flipped. Meantime, neighboring, more progressive countries like Germany, which took the virus so seriously from the beginning, are now announcing relatively aggressive reopening plans, and here we have Britain taking this far more cautious approach. It all seems quite scrambled, and I wonder what you make of that.\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, it\u2019s interesting. Every country had to make a choice about how to deal with something that is fundamentally so mysterious and so unpredictable. And the choices these countries made played out in ways that were either fortunate and successful, or tragic and largely unsuccessful. And that in turn has very much driven the way that these countries have dealt with this moment \u2014 the moment where they lift the lockdown. And so you have in Germany a country that, as you say, took the threat extremely seriously at the beginning, was very conservative, was very cautious, went to a lockdown, took the science of it extremely seriously. In Germany, the caution paid off. The death tolls stayed low. And now, as we come to this moment of lifting the lockdown, the Germans have the confidence to be brave, to take some risks, to lift elements of the lockdown, even at the risk of kicking up the infection rate. And conversely, here in England, where they came into this crisis with such an air of self-confidence, they\u2019ve now been rattled to their core. They\u2019ve really had their confidence shaken. And far from being brave or bold at this moment, they\u2019re now the country that\u2019s reacting with extreme caution. This libertarian country is now ready to keep the heavy hand of government in place, as long as it takes. And so you really see a role reversal that reflects how this virus has struck different countries, how the experiences that they\u2019ve undergone have been so starkly different. And as a result, how they\u2019re going to emerge from this period is sometimes extremely unexpected. And in Britain, it\u2019s been perhaps the most unexpected of all. The country that took this pandemic the least seriously is arguably going to now take it more seriously than anybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, thank you very much.\n\nmark landler\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Monday, countries across the world took some of their biggest steps yet toward easing restrictions on their citizens\u2019 movements. Spain began permitting small gatherings of up to 10 people, and for small shops to reopen. France allowed residents to leave their homes without filling out release forms for the first time in eight weeks.\n\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Russia announced the end of nationwide stay at home restrictions, despite a recent rise in infections. And \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If you look at all of those people over there, every one of them, from what I see, these are White House staffers, they\u2019re White House representatives, they\u2019re White House executives, and everybody has a mask on. We\u2019ve had \u2014\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThe White House has instituted a new rule, requiring that all employees wear masks inside the West Wing after two aides tested positive for the coronavirus.\n\narchived recording Were you the one who required that, sir? archived recording (donald trump) Yeah, I did. I did. I required it, yes.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nBut the policy is not expected to apply to either the president or the vice president, who, for weeks have avoided wearing masks. An attitude that The Times reports have trickled down to staff members, creating a dangerous situation.\n\n[music]", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.nytimes.com/2020/05/10/world/europe/coronavirus-britain-boris-johnson.html", "published": "2020-05-10T20:57:49", "title": "Britain to Impose Quarantine on Air Travelers to Fight Coronavirus", "text": "It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom, your freedom, of a kind that we have never seen before in peace or war.

This is \u201cThe Daily.\u201d\n\n[music]\n\nToday: As Europe begins to reopen, and countries like Germany send children back to school. Why the country that was the most skeptical of the virus may be the slowest to reopen. Mark Landler on the situation in Britain. It\u2019s Tuesday, May 12. Mark, how would you describe Boris Johnson\u2019s original approach to the coronavirus?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell I\u2019d say initially, he was really kind of out to lunch on it. You know, remember, the earliest days of the virus in late January, early February coincided with Britain formally leaving the European Union.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nRight.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) This is the moment when the dawn breaks and the curtain goes up on a new act in our great national drama.\n\nmark landler\n\nIn those early days, Johnson was really very preoccupied and distracted by the milestone of Brexit.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I know that we can turn this opportunity into a stunning success. And whatever the bumps in the road ahead, I know that we will succeed.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo there were several very key early meetings of his cabinet that he didn\u2019t attend, where the subject of the virus came up. And then even when you began to see the first cases in Britain, and it became clear that Britain also faced a major risk, he affected an air of nonchalance.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Wash your hands with soap and hot water for the length of time it takes to sing Happy Birthday twice.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe even sort of made light of some of the caution of the scientists. There was a very early press conference on March 3 where he made a point of saying he\u2019d visited coronavirus patients at a hospital, and he went around and shook all their hands.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I was at a hospital the other night where \u2014 I think there were actually a few coronavirus patients, and I shook hands with everybody, you\u2019ll be pleased to know. And I continue to shake hands and I think it\u2019s very important that we \u2014 people obviously can make up their own minds, I think \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then, as if seeking validation, he turned to the government\u2019s chief scientific adviser, who was standing next to him \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I think the scientific evidence is \u2014 well, I\u2019ll hand it over to the experts.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd the scientific advisor was shaking his head with pursed lips.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But our judgement is wash. Washing your hands is the crucial thing.\n\nmark landler\n\nThis is a guy who has his own way of living, and very much a live-and-let-live philosophy, and I think he brought an element of that to the early days of this crisis.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, there are obvious ways in which the story you\u2019re describing echoes what we saw here in the U.S., and with President Trump\u2019s initial response to the coronavirus. Having covered both our White House and now Downing Street, are there notable differences in the way the two countries and the two governments responded to their leaders dismissing the severity of the situation?\n\nmark landler\n\nOh, yeah. I think there are stark differences. And I would group them in a couple of categories. First, in the United States, you obviously have independent minded governors who chose to respond to the crisis for their own states, regardless of what President Trump\u2019s decisions and signals were on the federal level. You don\u2019t have that here in Britain. Here, Downing Street, the rime minister, really sets the policy for the whole country. So that\u2019s one obvious difference. I think somewhat more subtly is the role of the scientific community. In the United States, you had the C.D.C., Dr. Anthony Fauci and others very quickly and urgently calling for a very rigorous response for lockdowns. Here, on the other hand, you had a scientific community that took a slightly maverick initial response to this virus. There were very prominent scientists who advised the government who were arguing that maybe the best way to deal with the virus is to let it rip through the population, to let the population develop what they call herd immunity. And that that would build up a natural immunity that would make Britain more resilient to subsequent potential waves of infection. So this was an idea that was circulating in the scientific community in those early weeks \u2014 late February, early March \u2014 and it, to some extent, also informed where Boris Johnson was coming down on these issues. Unlike in the United States, where Donald Trump has blown hot and cold on his scientific advisors, Boris Johnson has said from the very start, I will be guided by the science. The wrinkle is that in those early days, the science was also calling for a more casual reaction. And that\u2019s what you saw in the first two weeks of March.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nThat\u2019s fascinating. So given that, what ends up being the official approach to this in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, in the second week of March \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon, everybody, and thank you very much for coming.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson has a daily news conference, very similar to what you saw in the White House with President Trump.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We\u2019ve done what can be done to contain this disease.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd at that news conference, he begins to urge a very mild form of social distancing.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) We are considering the question of banning major public events, such as sporting fixtures. And the scientific advice, as we\u2019ve said over the last couple of weeks, is that this banning such events will have little effect on the spread.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut he\u2019s stopping well short of asking people to quarantine themselves in their houses, closing restaurants, closing bars. All of things, by the way, that are being done by France, by parts of Germany, by Spain, by Italy. So at that point, Britain is a clear outrider, and you\u2019re really seeing the British go off in a very different direction that is really very striking, and beginning to draw notice all over Europe.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMm hmm.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd then on March 16, Imperial College, which is one of the leading institutions in Britain that studies infectious diseases, published a report that changed everything. The headline of the report was basically that if the British government allowed the virus to spread through the population unchecked, it risked anywhere from 250,000 to 500,000 fatalities.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWow.\n\nmark landler\n\nIt\u2019s worth noting that this report was written by an epidemiologist called Neil Ferguson. He\u2019s probably the leading figure on epidemics and infectious disease in this country, and his reports and his pronouncements have almost a sort of a holy writ quality to them. He\u2019s really viewed as something of an oracle in this area. And the report essentially terrified everyone inside the British government. And you could almost see the change in the thinking take shape over the subsequent days as Boris Johnson continued to appear on television, each day looking a little more rattled, a little more anxious. And then finally on Monday, March 23 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good evening. The coronavirus is the biggest threat this country has faced for decades.\n\nmark landler\n\nJohnson addressed the nation at around 7 o\u2019clock in the evening.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) From this evening, I must give the British people a very simple instruction: You must stay at home. You should not be meeting friends. If your friends ask you to meet, you should say no. If you don\u2019t follow the rules, the police will have the powers to enforce them.\n\nmark landler\n\nSo you now finally had Britain in alignment with Italy, with Spain, with France, in a total lockdown.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Stay at home, protect our NHS and save lives. Thank you.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut it was at least a week to 10 days later than those other countries had acted, so in essence, Britain lost some valuable days. And sure enough, events began to vindicate that very dark picture.\n\narchived recording Some breaking news coming into us from NHS England, and it is an update of some of the numbers of those who have sadly died.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe death toll begins mounting. The hospitals begin filling up. And in fact, and most dramatically, perhaps, the virus actually makes its way into the political establishment of the government.\n\narchived recording Now proof that the virus can affect anyone came earlier on Wednesday, when it was confirmed \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nThe first dramatic moment comes when Prince Charles, the heir to the throne, the eldest son of Queen Elizabeth, announces that he\u2019s tested positive.\n\narchived recording He has been displaying mild symptoms, but otherwise remains in good health, and has been working from home throughout the last few days as usual.\n\nmark landler\n\nA few days later, you begin hearing that senior officials in the government are testing positive. The health secretary, the man most directly responsible for leading the response to the crisis, has to quarantine himself. He has symptoms. The chief medical officer is quarantining himself. He has symptoms. And then on March 27 \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Hi, folks. I want to bring you up to speed with something that\u2019s happening today, which is that I\u2019ve developed mild symptoms of the coronavirus. That\u2019s to say, a temperature and a persistent cough.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson announces to the British public that he has tested positive for coronavirus and will be going into isolation.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) But be in no doubt that I can continue, thanks to the wizardry of modern technology, to communicate with all my top team to lead the national fight back against coronavirus. And I want to thank \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nSo what you see in that first week is Boris Johnson recording videos in which he says, I\u2019m still at the helm, I\u2019m still directing policy. He runs several crisis meetings from his apartment adjacent to 10 Downing Street. So he\u2019s isolated, but he\u2019s in command. That\u2019s the very reassuring message that he\u2019s trying to send. But then you arrive at an important weekend, the weekend of April 5, when Queen Elizabeth is going to address the nation on this national challenge of the pandemic. And she\u2019s delivered a handful of such addresses in her 68-year reign, so this is a very big, historic moment for the country.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) I\u2019m speaking to you at what I know is an increasingly challenging time.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe addresses the nation early in the evening.\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) We should take comfort that while we may have more still to endure, better days will return.\n\nmark landler\n\nShe finishes her address \u2014\n\narchived recording (queen elizabeth) But for now, I send my thanks and warmest good wishes to you all.\n\nmark landler\n\nAnd about an hour later, Downing Street puts out a press release saying Boris Johnson has entered the hospital.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nWe\u2019ll be right back. So Mark, what happens once Boris Johnson enters the hospital?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, the first thing that happens is there\u2019s a great deal of uncertainty over who would actually run the government were he to be incapacitated for a long time, or God forbid, not come back at all. Britain, unlike the United States, doesn\u2019t have a clear line of succession for the head of the government. But then you kind of enter this very unsettling period where the government is continuing to put out reassuring press releases. They invariably say the prime minister is in, quote, \u201cgood spirits.\u201d But his top aides acknowledge that no one\u2019s talked to him for several days. His doctors are not releasing any status reports on his condition. And there starts to be this undercurrent of worry in the country that things are actually maybe worse than we think. And then sure enough, a few days later comes the really alarming news \u2014\n\narchived recording (dominic raab) During the course of this afternoon, the prime minister\u2019s condition worsened, and on the advice of the medical team, he was moved into a critical care unit.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe\u2019s actually been admitted to the intensive care unit. Statistically, the odds of patients decline rapidly when they go into the I.C.U. And so there is a sense, a real sense, that Boris Johnson may not make it.\n\narchived recording 1 This is obviously an extremely serious situation. I mean, how worried should people be about his health and about who\u2019s in charge of the government? archived recording 2 Well, the government\u2019s business will continue. And the focus of the government will continue to be on making sure, the prime minister\u2019s direction, all the plans for making sure that we can defeat coronavirus and pull the country through this challenge, will be taken forward.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut then there\u2019s sort of good news.\n\narchived recording We got this statement from 10 Downing Street. The prime minister has been moved this evening from intensive care back to the ward, where he will receive close monitoring during the early phase of his recovery.\n\nmark landler\n\nYou start to hear better things. He\u2019s beginning to walk around a bit, he\u2019s beginning to read some briefing papers. And then on Easter Sunday, of all days \u2014\n\narchived recording The prime minister, Boris Johnson, has now been discharged from hospital as he continues his recovery from Covid-19.\n\nmark landler\n\nWe get the news that Boris Johnson has been discharged from the hospital. And of course, the timing occasions some classic British humor. Senior government officials are heard saying to each other, he has risen, and referring to Boris as the Messiah. And for the country, the moment of peak anxiety, the moment where they genuinely thought they might have lost their leader, has passed.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, I\u2019m curious how Brits responded to all of this. I could see this being an obvious moment for the British people to turn on Boris Johnson. He was slow to act, he took risks, he was pretty dismissive of the coronavirus. It would be easy to see all of this as the actions of an irresponsible leader that almost cost him his own life, and deprived the country of its prime minister.\n\nmark landler\n\nThat\u2019s a very plausible assumption to make. But oddly, it isn\u2019t the way it played out. And I think the reason it is isn\u2019t has to do with the rather clever way that Boris Johnson handled his own illness.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Good afternoon. I have today left hospital after a week in which the NHS has saved my life. No question.\n\nmark landler\n\nOn the day he was released from the hospital, he recorded this very heartfelt video, in which he thanked the doctors and nurses at the hospital for saving his life.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) I\u2019m going to forget some names, so please forgive me. But I want to thank Po Ling and Shannon and Emily and Angel and Connie and Becky and Rachael and Nicky \u2014\n\nmark landler\n\nHe singled out two of the nurses \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) Jenny from New Zealand \u2014 Invercargill, on the South Island, to be exact \u2014 and Luis from Portugal near Porto.\n\nmark landler\n\n\u2014 who kept a vigil at his bedside all night long, giving him oxygen.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) For every second of the night, they were watching, and they were thinking and they were caring and making the interventions I needed.\n\nmark landler\n\nThe NHS in this country is a revered institution, and so Boris Johnson very much tied himself to that institution and made his own personal story part of a broader narrative. And in so doing, he kept the support of the public far from turning on him, far from telling him you got what you deserved. I think a lot of people in this country were sympathetic to him, and it\u2019s really all the more remarkable when you consider that in the days and weeks since he left the hospital, the death toll from coronavirus in this country has continued to spiral upward. And as of a week ago or so, Britain now has the largest number of deaths of any country in Europe, and the second largest number of deaths of any country in the world, after the United States. And yet, even with that tragic human cost of this virus, Boris Johnson and his government retain the support of something like 51 percent , 52 percent of the people who approve of the way that they\u2019ve handled this virus.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nSo Mark, where are we right now in Britain? I mean, we\u2019re watching the world \u2014 Europe in particular \u2014 start to figure out what reopening is supposed to look like. Given this up-and-down history that you just recounted, what are you seeing that look like in Britain?\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, so Britain is facing this increasing pressure to restart its economy, to ease the lockdown, to try to bring society back to some level of normalcy. And you\u2019re beginning to see the Italians, the Spanish, the Germans lift their lockdown. Britain reaches that same moment, and Boris Johnson announces he\u2019s going to give a speech to the nation in which he\u2019s going to lay out a roadmap. And there\u2019s a tremendous burst of hope that we are at the end of this difficult period. Some of the tabloids talk about the end of the lockdown, and the happy days that lie ahead. And so on Sunday night \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) It is now almost two months since the people of this country began to put up with restrictions on their freedom \u2014 your freedom.\n\nmark landler\n\nBoris Johnson does appear and he delivers this fairly detailed speech.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) So I want to provide, tonight, for you, the shape of a plan, both to beat the virus and provide the first sketch of a roadmap for reopening society.\n\nmark landler\n\nHe lays out all sorts of benchmarks and criterias.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And the first step is a change of emphasis that we hope that people will act on this week. We said that you should work from home if you can, and only go to work if you must. We now need to stress that anyone who can\u2019t work from home, for instance, those in construction or manufacturing, should be actively encouraged to go to work. And we want it to be safe for you to get to work. In step two, at the earliest, by June the first, after half term, we believe we may be in a position to begin the phased reopening of shops and to get primary pupils back into schools.\n\nmark landler\n\nBut when you actually go back and read his words \u2014\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And step three, at the earliest by July, and subject to all these conditions and further the scientific advice \u2014 if and only if the numbers support it \u2014 we will hope to reopen at least some of the hospitality industry and other public places, provided they\u2019re safe and enforce social distancing.\n\nmark landler\n\nReally, nothing much has changed. He\u2019s given a very dramatic speech in which he has barely budged the policy.\n\narchived recording (boris johnson) And so, no. This is not the time simply to end the lockdown this week.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHuh. So his speech about reopening is really about how Britain is not about to truly reopen.\n\nmark landler\n\nYes. This turns out to be a speech that, when you really analyze it, is about why we are going to continue to live under a lockdown \u2014 one that might be tweaked at the edges here and there, there might be slight shifts \u2014 but fundamentally, nothing is changing in this country.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nIt\u2019s kind of remarkable how everything is flipped. Meantime, neighboring, more progressive countries like Germany, which took the virus so seriously from the beginning, are now announcing relatively aggressive reopening plans, and here we have Britain taking this far more cautious approach. It all seems quite scrambled, and I wonder what you make of that.\n\nmark landler\n\nWell, it\u2019s interesting. Every country had to make a choice about how to deal with something that is fundamentally so mysterious and so unpredictable. And the choices these countries made played out in ways that were either fortunate and successful, or tragic and largely unsuccessful. And that in turn has very much driven the way that these countries have dealt with this moment \u2014 the moment where they lift the lockdown. And so you have in Germany a country that, as you say, took the threat extremely seriously at the beginning, was very conservative, was very cautious, went to a lockdown, took the science of it extremely seriously. In Germany, the caution paid off. The death tolls stayed low. And now, as we come to this moment of lifting the lockdown, the Germans have the confidence to be brave, to take some risks, to lift elements of the lockdown, even at the risk of kicking up the infection rate. And conversely, here in England, where they came into this crisis with such an air of self-confidence, they\u2019ve now been rattled to their core. They\u2019ve really had their confidence shaken. And far from being brave or bold at this moment, they\u2019re now the country that\u2019s reacting with extreme caution. This libertarian country is now ready to keep the heavy hand of government in place, as long as it takes. And so you really see a role reversal that reflects how this virus has struck different countries, how the experiences that they\u2019ve undergone have been so starkly different. And as a result, how they\u2019re going to emerge from this period is sometimes extremely unexpected. And in Britain, it\u2019s been perhaps the most unexpected of all. The country that took this pandemic the least seriously is arguably going to now take it more seriously than anybody else.\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nMark, thank you very much.\n\nmark landler\n\nThank you, Michael.\n\n[music]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nHere\u2019s what else you need to know today. On Monday, countries across the world took some of their biggest steps yet toward easing restrictions on their citizens\u2019 movements. Spain began permitting small gatherings of up to 10 people, and for small shops to reopen. France allowed residents to leave their homes without filling out release forms for the first time in eight weeks.\n\narchived recording (vladimir putin) [SPEAKING RUSSIAN]\n\nmichael barbaro\n\nAnd Russia announced the end of nationwide stay at home restrictions, despite a recent rise in infections. And \u2014\n\narchived recording (donald trump) If you look at all of those people over there, every one of them, from what I see, these are White House staffers, they\u2019re White House representatives, they\u2019re White House executives, and everybody has a mask on.

That would have especially been true this past Friday, following a report from Japan\u2019s Nikkei newspaper that President Obama had decided to appoint Summers.\n\nFar from falling, however, the market rose on Friday \u2014 both at the open, right after that story appeared on the wires, and for the rest of the day as well.\n\nIndeed, Friday\u2019s action led some analysts to complain Friday that the market had yet to price in what they referred to as the \u201cSummers put.\u201d Never mind, though, logic has nothing to do with this market: It still rallied on Monday as though it had priced in that put.\n\nThe same has been true recently for other potentially bad news, such as Syria. The market shrugs off the initial threat of that bad news, and yet its removal is taken as the occasion for rallying.\n\nThe contrarian-based worry about this sentiment situation is that the market is being held up more by a happy mood than by a solid assessment of the fundamentals. As a result, the market will fall all the more precipitously when investors\u2019 mood begins to sour \u2014 as it eventually will.\n\nAnd though investor psychology is difficult to analyze, we know investors are notoriously fickle. Will it be paralysis in Washington over the debt ceiling that causes them to become less exuberant? A worsening of the Syria mess? Most likely, it will be something that comes out of left field that isn\u2019t even on our radar right now.\n\nThe one thing we do know is that, when that souring does happen, the market\u2019s lofty level will not be receiving much support from the fundamentals.\n\nBuyer beware.\n\nClick here to inquire about subscriptions to the Hulbert Stock Newsletter Sentiment Index.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/ayrWz1FSrQE/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-12T19:28:34", "title": "Picking a perfect dividend portfolio", "text": "CHAPEL HILL. N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 When it comes to dividends, more isn\u2019t always better: A company isn\u2019t necessarily more attractive just because it pays a higher dividend.\n\nThat is the clear lesson I draw from the dividend-oriented newsletter with the best long-term record among the 200 services in the Hulbert Financial Digest rankings: Investment Quality Trends, edited by Kelley Wright. \u201cHigher\u201d or \u201clower\u201d for him only have meaning when comparing a company\u2019s current dividend with what it paid in the past. He believes that comparisons with other companies are unhelpful.\n\nConsider CVS Caremark Corp. CVS, +1.41% , the drug retailer, and HCP Inc. US:HCP , the health-care real-estate investment trust. Wright rates CVS Caremark more highly than HCP, even though CVS\u2019s dividend yield \u2014 the annual dividend as a percentage of the stock price \u2014 is just 1.6%, while HCP has a 4.1% yield.\n\nWright believes CVS is the better bet because its current yield is at the high end of the range of its past yields, which have extended from a low of 0.4% to its current 1.6%. HCP\u2019s current yield, by contrast, is at the low end of its historical range, which has gotten as high as 12.4%. So, in terms of relative dividend yield, CVS\u2019s is higher than HCP\u2019s.\n\nHidden gems from the '70s\n\nOver the years, Wright has found that high yields come back down to earth and low yields rise back toward the midpoint of their historical range. That would be bad news for HCP, since a likely cause of its yield rising would be a falling stock price \u2014 which could lead to losses that more than eliminate the benefit of the high yield.\n\nFor CVS, by contrast, Wright believes the path of least resistance is for its yield to decline because its stock price rises.\n\nTo be sure, CVS\u2019s yield also would come down if the company cuts its dividend, which would be bad for its stock price. Wright therefore focuses his analysis only on companies with strong balance sheets and a long and consistent pattern of higher earnings and increasing dividends.\n\nThink before you grab those Ivy hunks\n\nSo how has Wright\u2019s strategy performed over time? According to the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s calculations, Investment Quality Trends over the past three decades has beaten the dividend-adjusted return of the entire U.S. stock market by an average of 1.2 percentage points a year \u2014 while nevertheless incurring less risk.\n\nThat is a winning combination: The service is in second place for risk-adjusted performance among the three dozen advisers for which track records extend back that far.\n\nWright\u2019s strategy is to be distinguished from the traditional approach to picking dividend stocks, which focuses on absolute rather than relative yield.\n\nOne popular variant of the traditional approach is the so-called Dogs of the Dow strategy, in which investors buy the 10 stocks among the 30 Dow Industrials DJIA, +0.25% with the highest yields. For example, the three Dow \u201cdogs\u201d that currently have the highest yields are two telecommunication companies, AT&T T, -0.94% (4.7%) and Verizon Communications VZ, -0.36% (4.1%), and tech giant Intel INTC, -1.35% (4.1%).\n\nDespite investing in stocks with yields this high, however, the strategy has disappointed recently. Over the past five years (through March 31), it has produced a 5.0% annualized return, lagging the 5.9% dividend-adjusted return of the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% and barely half the 10.8% return of a portfolio that is periodically updated to always contain just the 10 stocks that Wright recommends most highly.\n\nAnother variant of the traditional focus on absolute yield can be found in the S&P High Yield Dividend Aristocrats index. It contains the 50 highest-yielding stocks among the S&P 1500 Composite index that also have a long history of dividend increases.\n\nThe index\u2019s two largest components currently are Pitney Bowes (the mail and document-services company, with a 10.0% yield) and biotech company AbbVie (yielding 3.7%).\n\nThough the performance of the S&P Dividend Aristocrats index in recent years has been better than that of the Dogs of the Dow strategy, it still lags behind that of Investment Quality Trends. Over the past five years, the SPDR S&P Dividend ETF SDY, +0.15% , which is benchmarked to the index, has produced an annual dividend-adjusted return of 9.2% through March 31 \u2014 nearly two percentage points a year lower than the portfolio of Wright\u2019s 10 most attractive dividend stocks.\n\nNote carefully that this Wright portfolio currently holds none of the stocks that are at the top of the holdings list for either the Dogs of the Dow or the S&P Dividend Aristocrats. In addition to CVS Caremark, the following nine stocks are in Wright\u2019s portfolio: Air Products & Chemicals APD, +1.07% (yielding 3.3%), Archer Daniels Midland ADM, -0.11% (2.3%), Coca-Cola KO, -1.00% (2.7%), ConocoPhillips COP, +2.35% (4.4%), Occidental Petroleum OXY, +0.43% (3.2%), PepsiCo PEP, +2.15% (2.7%), Reliance Steel & Aluminum RS, +2.36% (1.7%), Texas Instruments TXN, -1.91% (3.1%) and Walgreen US:WAG (2.3%).\n\nThe average yield of all 10 stocks is 2.7%, versus 2.0% for the S&P 500 as a whole. And, even better, if Wright is right: These 10 have the potential to outperform the S&P 500 on a price-appreciation basis as well.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/nPEYyo38O6s/story.asp", "published": "2013-04-01T11:01:19", "title": "Car companies stuck in slow lane", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 The most cited bullish argument these days, at least among the couple of hundred investment advisers I monitor, is that the stock market will \u201cmelt up\u201d as investors sour on bonds and transfer the trillions they have in fixed-income mutual funds into stock funds.\n\nI suppose it is conceivable. But a careful review of historical fund patterns doesn\u2019t provide much support for this so-called Great Rotation argument.\n\nConsider the share of all mutual-fund assets (excluding money-market funds) that are allocated to either stocks or bonds. According to data provided by the Investment Company Institute in Washington, the equity share at the end of 2012 stood at 65.7%. That is only marginally lower than the 71% average of all comparable monthly readings since 1970.\n\nGiven that pattern, it is difficult to make the case that average fund investors are allocating an abnormally low share of their assets to stocks \u2014 or that they are about to increase that share.\n\nOther mutual-fund data cast doubt on the Great Rotation as well.\n\nPaper or plastic? Dollar bills, that is!\n\nConsider 1987, arguably the period over the past three decades most relevant to the Great Rotation argument today. Then, as now, a bull market was getting long in the tooth. Beginning in April of that year, following more than 60 months in which fund investors had invested an average of nearly $4 billion a month of new money in bonds, they reversed course in a big way. Over the next six months, according to the ICI data, fund investors withdrew an average of $3 billion a month from bond funds.\n\nAs market historians recall, the stock market that year topped out in August, four months after that trend reversal. And the 1987 crash \u2014 the worst one-day drop in U.S. stock-market history \u2014 occurred two months after that. Far from inaugurating a new bull market for stocks, that reversal in fund investors\u2019 opinion about bonds came right before a major stock-market top.\n\nAnother reason to question the Great Rotation argument is that any positive impact on the stock market is likely to be short-term at best. That, at least, is the finding of a study, \u201cMeasuring Investment Sentiment with Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d published last May in the Journal of Financial Economics.\n\nThe authors found that even though the stock market often rises as investors shift assets from bond funds to stock funds, almost all of that increase is reversed within four months\u2019 time.\n\nThe Great Rotation stock-market melt-up hypothesis also would have to fly in the face of well-documented seasonal trading patterns. A study presented in December at the Australasian Finance & Banking Conference in Sydney, \u201cSeasonal Asset Allocation: Evidence from Mutual Fund Flows,\u201d found that U.S. fund investors on average transfer assets from stock to bond funds during the winter months \u2014 and do just the reverse in summer.\n\nAs followers of the famous \u201cSell in May and Go Away\u201d seasonal pattern will recognize, the implication of this new research is that the stock market on balance has performed better when the direction of fund flows between stocks and bonds is in precisely the opposite direction of what\u2019s presumed by the Great Rotation argument.\n\nEven if a Great Rotation out of bonds comes to pass, it doesn\u2019t mean investors will move all of that money into stocks.\n\nIn fact, they probably would put much of it in boring old money-market funds, according to Claude Erb, a former fixed-income fund manager at Trust Co. of the West.\n\nInvestors are reluctant to transfer funds between one asset class and another, Erb says. Since they typically consider money-market funds to be in the fixed-income asset class, money funds most likely would be the primary beneficiary of bond-fund redemptions, he says \u2014 especially since the higher interest rates that make bond funds less attractive would make money funds more so.\n\nIf these patterns are any guide to the future, now might be the time to pull back from stocks rather than dive in. As Russ Wermers, a University of Maryland finance professor and one of the authors of the research presented at the December conference, puts it: \u201cFor most investors, the more proper response to the fund flow premise of the Great Rotation argument is probably to reduce equity exposure rather than allocate new sums to equities.\u201d", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/3FYsOI8GjSk/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-06T12:30:38", "title": "Insiders now aggressively bearish", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 Corporate insiders are aggressively selling their shares.\n\nThis is worrisome because corporate insiders \u2014 officers, directors and the largest shareholders \u2014 presumably know more about their companies\u2019 prospects than the rest of us do. If they were confident that the shares of their companies would soon be trading markedly higher, they wouldn\u2019t be selling them now.\n\nYet selling they are \u2014 at an alarming pace.\n\nConsider an insider indicator calculated by the Vickers Weekly Insider Report, published by Argus Research. The indicator is a ratio of all shares that insiders have recently sold in the open market to the number that they have purchased.\n\nFor the week that ended last Friday, this sell-to-buy ratio for NYSE-listed shares listed stood at 9.20-to-1. That means insiders of these companies, on average, were selling more than nine shares of their firms\u2019 stock for every one that they were buying.\n\nMutual funds take big bite of Apple\n\nThe last time a weekly sell-to-buy ratio was worse than this was in late July 2011, right before that year\u2019s debt-ceiling debate began to spiral out of control. Over the next couple of weeks, of course, as the U.S. Treasury\u2019s credit rating was downgraded, the Dow Jones Industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% lost some 2,000 points.\n\nTo be sure, insiders have been selling heavily for several weeks now, and the market has continued to rise \u2014 including the Dow\u2019s eclipsing of the 14,000 level in recent sessions. This surprising strength in the face of insider selling has prompted a number of you to inquire how unusual it is for the insiders collectively to be such poor market timers.\n\nAs you can imagine, it\u2019s not unprecedented. But it is more the exception than the rule.\n\nConsider where the sell-to-buy ratio was in mid-December, which is the last time I devoted a column to the insiders\u2019 behavior. For NYSE-listed stocks, the ratio at that time stood at 8.38-to-1. Read Dec. 18 Mark Hulbert column on insider selling.\n\nUpon reviewing the historical data, shared with me by Argus Research, I found four occasions over the last decade in which the ratio got this high or higher and the market continued rising for at least another month or two.\n\nOverall, however, the market fell. On average over the month following each prior occasion when the sell-to-buy ratio got this high, the broad market fell by 2.1% \u2014 as measured by the Wilshire 5000 total-return index.\n\nIn any case, as others among you have pointed out, the high level of insider selling in December could very well have been caused in large part by the prospect of higher tax rates in 2013 \u2014 which would have prompted them to accelerate their sales. To the extent this was so, of course, the high sell-to-buy ratio at that time would have been a false signal.\n\nRegardless, the sell-to-buy ratio today is even higher than it was in mid-December, and it can\u2019t be discounted because of the immediate prospect of higher taxes.\n\nAll of which suggests to me that there is a distinct possibility that this time around, unlike in December, the insiders will be right.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/wPEX3LaXAsc/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-05T12:01:27", "title": "How to pick dividend-paying stocks", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C. (MarketWatch) \u2014 So you\u2019ve finally decided to heed the oft-repeated advice to invest in dividend-paying stocks.\n\nNow what?\n\nIt turns out that you still have an overwhelmingly large number of stocks to choose among. In 2012, for example, more than 400 of the 500 stocks in the S&P 500 index SPX, +0.39% paid dividends \u2014 or more than 80% of them.\n\nTelling me to confine myself to just the dividend-payers, therefore, doesn\u2019t narrow my buy list down to a helpful number.\n\nThe best way of going about constructing a portfolio of dividend-paying stocks, based on the Hulbert Financial Digest\u2019s monitoring of more than 500 separate strategies, is to follow the methodology employed by Investment Quality Trends.\n\nWhy Dow may hit 15,000 in 2013\n\nThis service, inaugurated by Geraldine Weiss more than four decades ago and currently edited by Kelley Wright, doesn\u2019t simply recommend the dividend stocks with the highest yield. The service instead focuses more narrowly on the bluest of the blue-chip dividend-paying stocks, and recommends one of them only when its yield is near the high end of its historical range.\n\nThe service\u2019s restriction to just the bluest of blue-chip companies is designed to avoid companies at which the dividend yield is only temporarily high \u2014 firms that are about to cut their dividends, in other words.\n\nSpecifically, Wright puts a stock on his watch list only if it satisfies at least five of the following six criteria:\n\nHas increased its dividend at least 5 times over the last dozen years\n\nHas an S&P Quality Ranking in the \u201cA\u201d category\n\nHas at least 5 million shares outstanding\n\nHas at least 80 institutional investors\n\nHas paid dividends for at least 25 straight years\n\nHas produced higher earnings per share in at least 7 of the last 12 years\n\nThe service\u2019s focus on relative dividend yield is a recognition that each company has a different baseline. A utility company, for example, may still pay a much higher dividend yield than other companies, even when that yield is lower than its baseline \u2014 and when, therefore, it more likely than not is overvalued.\n\nHow has this approach performed? Over the last 12 months, for example, it has outperformed all of the major dividend-oriented ETFs. The average portfolio from Investment Quality Trends has gained 16.9% over this period, according to the Hulbert Financial Digest.\n\nBetter yet, this superior return was produced with nearly 20% less volatility, or risk \u2014 which means its performance on a risk-adjusted basis is even better than the raw numbers already suggest.\n\nIts record over the longer term has also been impressive. Over the 25 years the Hulbert Financial Digest has tracked it, it has beaten a buy-and-hold by one percentage point per year on an annualized basis, while nevertheless incurring 14% less risk.\n\nInvestment Quality Trends currently is in third place for risk-adjusted performance over the last 25 years.\n\nWhich high-quality stocks are currently recommended by this approach? The following is Wright\u2019s \u201cTimely Ten\u201d list of his top 10 current recommendations:\n\nThis package of 10 stocks not only has an average dividend yield of 2.6% but, Wright is convinced, has good capital-appreciation potential in the event of a continuation of the bull market, and healthy downside protection in the event of a bear market.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/stWPJLBZcDU/story.asp", "published": "2013-02-01T12:01:39", "title": "The 5 biggest investor mistakes of 2013", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

(MarketWatch) \u2014 Facebook Inc.\u2019s revenue is growing at a fast pace. But it isn\u2019t growing fast enough to support the social network\u2019s current stock price.\n\nFacebook FB, +1.96% released its latest quarterly earnings after the close on Wednesday \u2014 reporting quarterly revenue of $1.59 billion. That brought revenue for all of last year to $5.1 billion. See: Facebook\u2019s results beat estimates\n\nThat\u2019s a big number, for sure, and certainly seems impressive.\n\nTo understand why I nevertheless believe that it\u2019s not good enough, it\u2019s helpful to review a back-of-the-envelope calculation of Facebook\u2019s valuation that I introduced in a column immediately after the company went public last May at $38 per share. Follow full coverage of Facebook\u2019s quarterly results and conference call.\n\nDoes Facebook have its mojo back?\n\nThat calculation required just three inputs:\n\nFacebook\u2019s revenue growth rate over its first five years as a publicly traded company. I assumed that it would be the same as the average of all U.S. IPOs between 1996 and 2005 \u2014 212% cumulatively, or 25.6% on an annualized basis (after excluding spinoffs and buyouts).\n\nFacebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in five years\u2019 time. I assumed it would be the same as Google\u2019s is today GOOG, +1.25% \u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s.\n\n\u2014 which is a quite generous assumption, since Google\u2019s price-to-sales ratio is nearly four times larger than the overall market\u2019s. The rate of return Facebook investors would require to hold the stock for the five years after its IPO. Generously, I assumed the market\u2019s long-term average return of 11%. If I had assumed a higher return number, then the outcome of my analysis would have been an even lower fair value today.\n\nArmed with these three otherwise generous inputs, calculating a fair price for Facebook was a matter of simple math: As I reported last May, that price was $13.80. Read previous column: Facebook\u2019s stock should trade for $13.80.\n\nHow can Facebook overcome this awful fate? Since investors won\u2019t be happy earning less than 11% per year, and since it\u2019s unreasonable to expect the company\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2017 to be markedly higher than Google\u2019s is today, the only realistic way for Facebook to overcome my dismal price target is for its revenue growth rate to be far higher than 25.6% per year through 2016.\n\nFacebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg Getty Images\n\nYet the company has not shown that it can maintain this much higher revenue growth rate.\n\nTo be sure, it might on the surface seem otherwise. The company\u2019s revenues for calendar 2012 were 37% higher than in 2011.\n\nBut, according to Jay Ritter, a finance professor at the University of Florida who is one of academia\u2019s leading experts on IPOs, the typical pattern is for a post-IPO company\u2019s revenue growth rate to decline over its first several years after going public.\n\nTo average 25.6% over its first five years after coming to market, therefore, a company\u2019s revenue growth in its first couple of years needs to be above that rate.\n\nConsider, for instance, the average revenue growth rate over the first three years after a company comes to market. According to Ritter, this three-year growth rate was 36.7% per year for the same sample of IPOs that produced a five-year annualized growth rate of 25.6%.\n\nSo Facebook\u2019s revenue growth over this past year is almost precisely in line with the rate that was the basis of my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nHow, then, is Wall Street able to persuade itself that Facebook should be trading at its currently high price? As far as I can tell, by assuming Facebook deserves to have a sky-high price-to-sales ratio \u2014 not just now, but also well into the future.\n\nConsider, according to FactSet, the consensus estimate of Facebook\u2019s revenues in calendar 2015 \u2014 the furthest year out for which a consensus estimate is provided. That consensus is $10.5 billion\u2014not that far off of what was implied by my back-of-the-envelope calculation.\n\nAssuming that consensus is on target, and assuming Facebook\u2019s price-to-sales ratio in 2015 will be the same as Google\u2019s is today, then Facebook\u2019s market cap at the end of 2015 would be around $52 billion. That\u2019s some 25% lower than where the company\u2019s market cap stands today.\n\nDon\u2019t like the conclusions of my calculations? Be my guest and go through the exercise yourself, employing any of the standard valuation metrics. And use your calculations to subject Facebook\u2019s latest quarterly earnings report to a smell test.\n\nMy hunch is that if you do so, you will not be running out to buy Facebook stock afterward.\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/~r/marketwatch/newslettersAndresearch/~3/WztdRhRt8IM/story.asp", "published": "2013-01-25T16:27:45", "title": "Apple\u2019s drop shows price of popularity", "text": "CHAPEL HILL, N.C.

Reuters\n\nBP BP, -1.44% , in contrast, was on life support as it struggled to cope with the disastrous oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. Its stock price had plunged to its lowest in over a decade. Survival was by no means assured.\n\nLike the good contrarian he is, however, Arnott was willing to \u201ckiss the frog\u201d: He publicly bet that BP would outperform Apple over the longer term.\n\nThat was a gutsy bet indeed. If you don\u2019t believe me, take a look at the vitriolic comments my column received for merely reporting Arnott\u2019s bet. Read August 2010 column in Barron\u2019s by Mark Hulbert: Is Apple\u2019s market value too big for comfort?\n\nTo be sure, Arnott\u2019s bet only recently became a winner. But he is today enjoying the last laugh: Since BP\u2019s low in the summer of 2010, it has produced a cumulative real return of 77%, in contrast to 71% for Apple.\n\nThis isn\u2019t the only time Arnott has kissed a frog. Another came a year after his BP-over-AAPL bet: In August 2011 he predicted that Bank of America BAC, -1.24% would outperform Apple over the long term.\n\nAt that time, it was hard to imagine Bank of America\u2019s reputation being more awful. It represented all that was dysfunctuional about bank and mortgage-company behavior that led to the credit crunch and liquidity crisis of 2008.\n\nEven today it is paying the price for its bad deeds: Its latest quarterly earnings, released last week, were hugely depressed by billions in charges related to the settlement of various legal disputes arising out of the subprime-mortgage fiasco. Read full report on BAC earnings.\n\nIs Apple a value investor's dream?\n\nYet on this BAC-over AAPL bet, Arnott is even further in the black than he is with his BP bet: Since my August 2011 column reporting it, Bank of America stock has produced an 18-month real return of 60%, versus 25% for Apple.\n\nTo be sure, contrarian bets like Arnott\u2019s don\u2019t always work out this nicely. But, more often than not, they do.\n\nWe know this because of the superior long-term performance of benchmarks like Arnott\u2019s so-called fundamental indices, which almost always end up underweighting the stocks with the largest market caps.\n\nConsider the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index, which weights stocks according to a number of fundamental criteria rather than market cap. In the summer of 2010, for example, when Arnott made his BP-over-AAPL bet, Apple was the 27th largest company in that index. It would have been the second-largest company in the index if its weight had been based on market cap.\n\nSince the inception of the FTSE RAFI All-Caps US 1000 index in November 2005, its alternate weighting scheme has added 1.44 percentage points per year to its return. That\u2019s a lot of alpha to trace to changing each stock\u2019s weight in the index.\n\nKeep that in mind the next time you\u2019re tempted to invest in the latest fad on Wall Street.\n\nWhat frog might a contrarian be kissing right now?\n\nIn an email earlier this week, Chris Brightman, head of investment management at Research Affiliates, suggested betting on Wal-Mart WMT, +2.04% over Amazon AMZN, +0.87% . The latter company may not have the same pizzazz that Apple did in its heyday, but it still represents the allure and promise of the high-tech sector \u2014 especially in contrast to Wal-Mart.\n\nAmazon\u2019s stock is up over 50% over the last year, triple Wal-Mart\u2019s stock gain of just 17%.\n\nBrightman\u2019s contrarian-based reasoning: \u201cToday, Amazon has a market capitalization of $124 billion, more than half of Wal-Mart\u2019s $233 billion market cap. Yet Wal-Mart is more than five times the size of Amazon measured by sales, cash flow, dividends, and book value. Wal-Mart has free cash flow ... of $11 billion per year to distribute to its shareholders \u2014 which is paid as $5 billion in dividends and $6 billion as share buybacks \u2014 providing a nearly 5% annual yield.\u201d\n\n\u201cAmazon [in contrast] has only $2 billion of free cash flow and pays nothing back to its shareholders. Amazon\u2019s sales and cash flow will need to more than quintuple relative to Wal-Mart to match Wal-Mart\u2019s ability to pay its shareholders. Anything less, and Wal-Mart is the better investment.\u201d\n\nClick here to learn more about the Hulbert Financial Digest.", "author": ["Mark Hulbert"]}]}, "marketwatch_stories": {"rss": "http://feeds.marketwatch.com/marketwatch/topstories/", "link": "https://www.marketwatch.com/newsviewer/", "articles": [{"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B65E0A438-96A5-11EA-8340-95FDE6EE78E0%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-16T23:48:15", "title": "Where\u2019s my $1,200 stimulus check?

Some 130 million checks have already been sent out, and millions more people are awaiting their checks. The IRS will send $1,200 payments to individuals with adjusted gross annual income below $75,000, and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000.\n\n\u201c \u2018Eligible taxpayers who received a smaller-than-expected economic impact payment may qualify to receive an additional amount early next year.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Internal Revenue Service guidance\n\n\u201cIn many instances, eligible taxpayers who received a smaller-than-expected economic impact payment may qualify to receive an additional amount early next year when they file their 2020 federal income tax return,\u201d the IRS said. \u201cEIPs are technically an advance payment of a new temporary tax credit that eligible taxpayers can claim on their 2020 return. Everyone should keep for their records the letter they receive by mail within a few weeks after their payment is issued.\u201d\n\nIf the IRS doesn\u2019t have a taxpayer\u2019s direct-deposit information on file, the agency will mail checks, but those checks mailed out after a deadline last Wednesday would arrive by late May at the earliest, the agency said. You can submit your bank-account and address information through the IRS tracking tool, \u201cGet My Payment.\u201d It should also tell you if the IRS needs more bank-account information. Having your bank details on file will help speed the plow for a payment next year.\n\nDon\u2019t miss:\u2018We will not have a vaccine by next winter.\u2019 Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens now?\n\nI receive hundreds of emails every week from people who have not received their stimulus check. Some were listed as dependents on their parents\u2019 tax returns, which rules them out of receiving a payment this year; others do qualify yet wonder why they have not received a payment. If the IRS does not have your bank-account information on file, it will likely take longer. Approximately 14 million Americans don\u2019t have bank accounts or 6.5% of U.S. households.\n\nAlso see: I received my ex-husband\u2019s $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. Should I give him the money or return it to the IRS?\n\nImmigration status also plays a role. The government is paying American citizens, and some non\u2013U.S. citizens, including \u201clegal permanent residents\u201d or green-card holders, according to the IRS. Marriage to a green-card holder does not necessarily mean a second stimulus check, lawyers say. Others have had their stimulus checks garnished due to unpaid child-support payments. If you are behind on student loans, however, that will not impact your payment.\n\nThe Moneyist: My son is staying with me, yet my financially irresponsible ex-husband received his $500 stimulus check. Is my ex right to keep it?\n\nThe White House is mulling a second round of payments, two senior administrative officials told CNBC Thursday CMCS, +0.32% CMCSA, +0.44% . The White House released a statement in response to that report: \u201cAs President Trump has said, we are going to ensure that we take care of all Americans so that we emerge from this challenge healthy, stronger, and with economic prosperity, which is why the White House is focused on pro-growth, middle class tax and regulatory relief.\u201d\n\nCongratulations on starting a new life, Shaquanna.

That\u2019s because the system isn\u2019t taking in enough cash from payroll taxes, which is how the gargantuan Social Security program\u2014by far the single biggest source of federal spending\u2014is financed.\n\nRead: Another victim of COVID-19: Social Security\n\nPrior to the economic downturn\u2014or collapse\u2014that we\u2019re now experiencing, the trust fund was projected to run out of money by 2035.\n\nThis has, practically overnight, gotten worse. Why? Because some 22 million Americans have lost their jobs in the last four weeks. This means there are a lot fewer\u2014millions fewer\u2014people paying those payroll taxes into the Social Security system.\n\nAnd on top of a lot less money coming in, a lot more will soon be going out. That\u2019s because people who are now out of work and eligible to draw benefits may soon do so, out of sheer economic need.\n\nThis one-two punch could mean the depletion of the trust fund sooner than 2035. How soon? Perhaps two years earlier\u20142033\u2014estimates one of the country\u2019s leading experts on Social Security, Alicia H. Munnell, the director of the Center for Retirement Research at Boston College, and a MarketWatch columnist.\n\n\u201cWe are going to lose a lot of payroll tax revenue this year,\u201d Munnell says, while \u201cexpenditures keep at their regular pace, if not at an immediately higher pace, because older people who can\u2019t find a job might turn to claiming early.\u201d\n\nThis means the gap between what Social Security takes in and what it pays out\u2014which, again was growing to begin with\u2014will widen further. \u201cThe trust fund has been filling that gap,\u201d Munnell adds, \u201cbut as that gap gets bigger, the trust fund will be used up faster.\n\nThat\u2019s how Munnell\u2019s estimated 2033 depletion estimate comes in. Two years faster than what the Social Security trustees estimated last year.\n\nHistory offers some guidance here. During the near-economic collapse of 2008, which was accompanied by a devastating 57% drop in the S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% from its 2007 peak, millions of Americans saw their investment portfolios evaporate. The one-two punch then\u2014millions of jobs lost and older Americans opting to take Social Security earlier than they otherwise might have\u2014caused the trust fund\u2019s estimated depletion date to fall four years, Munnell says, from 2041 to 2037. It then drifted lower to last year\u2019s estimate of 2035. Now, it could drop another two years.\n\nThings were so bad back then, that Boston College\u2019s Center for Retirement Research estimated that \u201cthe Great Recession induced more than 5% of the eligible population to claim their benefits at age 62, and this impact was similar for individuals across the income spectrum.\u201d This meant that these early claimers wound up with lower checks each month than they would have gotten had they waited until full retirement age. But if you needed money and work was scarce, your options were limited. History, it seems, is about to repeat.\n\nAgain, what happens when the trust fund runs out? Since Social Security is financed by payroll taxes, the Social Security Trustees estimated last year that benefits would have to be cut about 25%. And that was before the current crisis.\n\nThe Social Security trustees\u2014which include Labor Secretary Alexander Acosta, Heath and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar and the head trustee, Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin\u2014have yet to release their own updated estimate on just how faster the trust fund will run out of cash.", "author": ["Paul Brandus"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B8FA24A40-4125-11EA-8303-2A4D8966E38A%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-16T20:53:51", "title": "My retirement income is $95,000 a year, and I want a walkable, affordable beach town to spend the winter.

Here are three spots in walkable, pretty affordable beach towns.\n\nSt. Augustine, Florida\n\nSt. Augustine, Florida iStock\n\nThis city of about 15,000 residents is nestled along the county\u2019s 42 miles of pristine beaches and boasts tons of history. \u201cYou can\u2019t walk very far in St. Augustine without being reminded that it is the oldest European-established city in the U.S.\u2014one that houses more than 60 historic sites and attractions, including a town square that dates to 1573. The city is still very much alive, however. Pedestrian-only St. George Street, lined with bistros, boutiques and bars, bustles all day and well into the night, with live music coming from practically every other open door,\u201d writes Kiplinger\u2019s of the town, which it calls a \u201csmart\u201d place to retire.\n\nAnd Travel & Leisure, which named it one of the seven best places to visit in Florida, notes that: \u201cIt\u2019s a walkable town, imbued with intrigue; whispers of the past swirl through every cobblestoned alley.\u201d Kiplinger\u2019s adds that St. Augustine has \u201ceverything from golf to belly dancing for retirees\u201d as well as \u201cplenty of cultural activities, affordable luxury living, and first-class health care.\u201d\n\nTo be sure, there are cheaper cities to live in Florida \u2014 the cost of living in St. Augustine is slightly above average for the U.S. \u2014 but this city has so many perks to recommend it, and with your income you can likely make this work: The median rent for a one-bedroom apartment is $800 and the median two-bedroom is under $1,000, according to Sperlings (though you may pay more in the heart of things) \u2014 not to mention that Florida is one of the most tax-friendly states in the country for retirees, Kiplinger\u2019s notes. (Here\u2019s a piece on how snowbirds can be taxed as Florida residents.)\n\nGalveston, Texas\n\nGalveston, Texas iStock\n\nTexas, like Florida, has no income tax and is tax-friendly to retirees \u2014 and Galveston itself has a cost of living that\u2019s significantly below average. It\u2019s also, at least in parts, reasonably walkable and offers \u201cquiet beaches as well as a lively cultural scene,\u201d writes Kiplinger\u2019s, which calls it a \u201cgreat place to retire.\u201d\n\nYou won\u2019t be bored there: \u201cBecause Galveston attracts a lot of weekend visitors, there\u2019s always something going on,\u201d writes Kiplinger\u2019s \u2014 including annual celebrations like Mardi Gras, the Food and Wine Festival, the Brewmasters Craft Beer Festival, as well as an amusement park, and summertime concerts. Plus, Houston \u2014 which has excellent health care and plenty more to do \u2014 is under an hour\u2019s drive away. Crime is slightly elevated in Galveston, but there are safer neighborhoods.\n\nIt\u2019s not just a resort town either, writes the New York Times: \u201cGalveston (population, 49,000) has more character than most flip-flop playgrounds. Its history, as rich as that of Charleston, S.C., or New Orleans, is evident in the majestic downtown structures and in palm-lined neighborhoods of Victorian homes painted in jelly bean shades\u2026More recently, an enormous rebuilding effort in the 1980s started a new round of changes.

He was the first and only House Republican to support impeachment, eventually voting for both articles of impeachment against the President as an independent late last year.\n\nAmash left the Republican Party in July 2019 after writing in a Washington Post op-ed that he had grown \u201cdisenchanted\u201d with party politics, becoming the first GOP member on record to declare that Trump had engaged in impeachable conduct.\n\nIn a series of tweets on Saturday, Amash said the decision to drop out was \u201cdifficult,\u201d but that he \u201cbelieves a candidate from outside the old parties, offering a vision of government grounded in liberty and equality, can break through in the right environment.\u201d\n\n\u201cPolarization is near an all-time high. Electoral success requires an audience willing to consider alternatives, but both social media and traditional media are dominated by voices strongly averse to the political risks posed by a viable third candidate,\u201d he added.\n\nThe Libertarian Party, he added, \u201cis well positioned to become a major and consistent contender to win elections at all levels of government.\u201d\n\n\u201cI remain invested in helping the party realize these possibilities and look forward to the successes ahead,\u201d he said.\n\nHe was facing a tough reelection in Michigan\u2019s 3rd District. National Republicans were eager to defeat him, and several Republicans have been running for the seat.\n\nAmash was first elected to represent Michigan\u2019s 3rd Congressional District in the 2010 \u201cTea Party\u201d wave.\n\nThe Michigan congressman is the son of a Syrian immigrant mother and a Palestinian refugee father. Before entering Congress, he worked as a lawyer for his family\u2019s business and served a term from 2008-2010 in the Michigan state house.\n\nOver the years, Amash has been consistently willing to take controversial votes according to his view of limited government, often being one of the only House members to vote against legislation with broad bipartisan support, such as an anti-lynching bill in February.\n\nIn 2015, Amash was one of the founding members of the House Freedom Caucus, an influential group of hardline conservatives that clashed with House Republican leadership and pushed for a more open legislative process and curtailed federal spending.\n\nAmash has repeatedly told reporters he would only run for president if he believes there is a path to victory. In March 2019, he told CNN he never stops thinking about possibilities like running for president \u201cbecause there is a big problem with the current two-party system we have, and someone has to shake it up.\u201d\n\nAmash explained on Twitter that he believed there were probably insurmountable hurdles to running a successful candidacy this year from outside the two major political parties.\n\nAmong those challenges, he said, is the difficulty of campaigning and qualifying for the ballot in all 50 states during a pandemic that has brought much of the country\u2019s public life to a halt. He added that it would be difficult to raise money in the middle of a severe economic downturn.\n\n\u201cNever-Trumper\u201d Republicans, including former Rep. Joe Walsh \u2014 who launched a failed 2020 presidential bid of his own \u2014 were concerned Amash would not win but \u201csiphon enough votes\u201d from presumptive Democratic nominee Joe Biden to \u201chand the election to Trump\u201d, Politico reported.\n\nPresident Trump disagreed with that assessment, saying in a tweet then that Amash would make a \u201cwonderful candidate\u201d and had \u201cno chance of maintaining his Congressional seat.\u201d\n\nTrump has routinely chastised Amash on social media, calling him a \u201closer\u201d and blasting the congressman as being disloyal.", "author": []}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B3532E59E-8D6D-11EA-AD06-F36B40BB8290%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-16T20:19:55", "title": "\u2018Fortunes are going to be made\u2019 \u2014 Suze Orman on investing amid the coronavirus pandemic", "text": "Celebrity financial adviser Suze Orman isn\u2019t for everybody.

You will never, ever, know the top,\u201d she said. \u201cFortunes are going to be made out of this time. So just stay calm. I can guarantee you that if you stay in and you just stick with it, three years from now you will be very, very happy that you did.\u201d\n\nHere\u2019s Orman talking financial stability in a recent appearance on the Tamron Hall Show:\n\nOrman, of course, is not alone in pushing the time-tested dollar-cost averaging approach.\n\nFor instance, Kimberlee Orth, the Ameriprise private wealth adviser who was ranked No. 2 in the U.S. among her peers in 2019 by Barrons, recently urged investors to stick with the same plan.\n\n\u201cIf you were already in the market on Feb. 1 or March 1 or April 1, and you watched the market go down and those resources are allocated to a long-term goal and your risk tolerance is still suitable,\u201d she said, \u201cthere\u2019s no need to change that because the market is eventually going to go back up.\u201d", "author": ["Shawn Langlois"]}, {"link": "http://www.marketwatch.com/news/story.asp?guid=%7B2855C492-8DF2-11EA-BF80-ADEBCF1A58C2%7D&siteid=rss&rss=1", "published": "2020-05-16T20:15:54", "title": "My daughter claimed me as a dependent in 2019.

You will have to file a return. The checks are based on your 2020 tax returns, but the IRS uses 2018 returns for those who have not filed in 2019 and will use 2019 returns for those who have filed this year.\n\nThat may not help you in 2020 and millions of people who are in dire need of a check, especially those who are worried about paying electricity and grocery bills, and rent due to the coronavirus pandemic. Some 49% of people are living paycheck to paycheck, according to this survey, which was taken before 30 million people filed for unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic. The IRS is sending $1,200 to individuals with annual adjusted gross income below $75,000 and $2,400 to married couples filing taxes jointly who earn under $150,000, plus $500 per qualifying child.\n\nDispatches from a pandemic:Letter from New York: \u2018New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags.

There\u2019s growing concern among many Americans that debt collectors will garnish or swipe their checks. \u201cCreditors may view stimulus payments as an opportunity to seize money for amounts owed on outstanding court judgments.

This man said he was effectively \u201cpunished\u201d by the government for being responsible because he filed his 2019 taxes early \u2014 and received $200 for his household.\n\nAlso see: I received my ex-husband\u2019s $1,200 stimulus check because we filed joint taxes in 2018. Should I give him the money or return it to the IRS?\n\nYou can return the money via check or money order with the notation \u201c2020EIP,\u201d plus the Social Security number or taxpayer I.D. of the check recipient. Those people who received a paper check and did not cash it can write \u201cvoid\u201d on the back of the check\u2019s endorsement section and mail it back to the IRS, according the IRS directions (see Q41), with an explanation.\n\nDon\u2019t miss:\u2018We will not have a vaccine by next winter.\u2019 Like the 1918 Spanish flu, CDC says second wave of coronavirus could be worse. So what happens now?\n\nPeople who did not receive a check this year or only a small amount and believe their income will fall below the required threshold for checks next year could still receive a stimulus payment next year. The EIP is technically an advance payment of a tax credit on your 2020 return. The IRS is using 2019 tax returns to gauge people\u2019s incomes; 2018 tax returns are used as a Plan B.\n\nThe IRS has sent out 128.3 million stimulus checks so far and already paid $218.4 billion \u2014 which is most of the stimulus money that\u2019s been set aside for direct payments to families and individuals across America as the coronavirus outbreak continues, the agency said last week. That will obviously be welcome for the more than 30 million people who are out of a job.\n\nBravo for doing the right thing. It does bring more fairness to this often haphazard process. One-third of Americans say they expect that their share of the stimulus money won\u2019t even sustain them for a full month, according to this survey. Chuck Rettig, the commissioner for the federal tax agency, said, \u201cWe are working hard to continue delivering these payments to Americans who need them.\u201d\n\nThank you, Jason, for doing your part.\n\nDispatches from a pandemic:Letter from New York: \u2018New Yorkers wear colorful homemade masks, while nurses wear garbage bags\u2019\n\nCoronavirus update: As of Monday, nearly 9 million people had been tested in the U.S. for SARS-CoV-2.

Because the yield on the three-month Treasury bill was higher than the yield on the five-year Treasury note for the entire second quarter of 2019. That \u201cinverted yield curve\u201d had been the harbinger of the previous seven recessions. Harvey first identified the inverted yield curve\u2019s predictive power in his 1986 doctoral dissertation at the University of Chicago.\n\n\u201c \u2018It's a biological event, and the solution is also clear: another biological event.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Campbell Harvey\n\nSo, here we are in what could be the deepest recession since the Great Depression, triggered by a global pandemic and governments\u2019 unprecedented actions to prevent its spread. What does Harvey expect for the U.S. economy now? He sees this recession hitting deep but being short \u2014 with the economy in recovery mode by the end of this year.\n\n\u201cIn the global financial crisis [in 2008-09], we never could tell when it was going to end,\u201d he said in a telephone interview. This time, he said, \u201cthe cause is clear \u2014 it's a biological event, and the solution is also clear: another biological event.\u201d\n\nHe doesn\u2019t anticipate the V-shaped recovery that Wall Street touted a few weeks ago. \u201cI think it's more what I call the \u2018skinny U,\u2019 because I do believe that we will have a vaccine by the first quarter [of 2021],\u201d he said.\n\nThat\u2019s certainly more optimistic than the projections of experts like Dr. Anthony Fauci. But the strong recovery of the Dow Jones industrial Average DJIA, +0.25% and S&P 500 SPX, +0.39% from their March lows suggests forward-looking investors are factoring this in, too.\n\n\u201c \u2018We were headed towards a mild, short recession. Then the COVID-19 pandemic struck and changed everything.\u2019 \u201d \u2014 Campbell Harvey\n\nHarvey\u2019s recession call was more pessimistic than most forecasters at the time, who saw no recession for this year, either. Would the recession have happened without the pandemic?\n\n\u201cWe\u2019ll never know the counterfactual,\u201d he said. \u201cThe inversion was moderate, so I think that we were headed towards a mild, short recession. Then the COVID-19 pandemic struck and changed everything.\u201d\n\nIndeed. Harvey considers the novel coronavirus an accelerant of underlying trends resulting in this recession, which he thinks began in the first quarter of 2020. We\u2019re going through the worst of it right now. \u201cThink of the second quarter as the worst quarter of [GDP] growth that the U.S. has ever experienced, historically,\u201d he said. \u201cIt could be 30% negative on an annualized basis. The third quarter, it's hard to imagine getting worse than where we are.\u201d\n\nHarvey adds that he can see some green shoots just in time for winter, as coronavirus treatments emerge and the world gets closer to testing and deploying a vaccine. \u201cA vaccine is the solution in terms of reducing all of the uncertainty. A vaccine means \u2018all clear,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201dIf we've got some pharmacological solution that reduces the risk of death, that's also incredibly helpful.\u201d\n\nNeither Harvey nor I are experts on vaccines, so I\u2019ll stay neutral on this, but he has done some research and thinks a vaccine could be available sooner than most expect. Pfizer PFE, -0.42% is one of several pharmaceutical and biotech companies testing vaccines on an accelerated basis. Harvey is particularly hopeful about a vaccine being developed at the University of Oxford, in partnership with AstraZeneca AZN, -0.16% , which just started Phase I trials in the U.K. If those go well, said Harvey, it could be distributed throughout the U.K. later this year.\n\n\u201cThe point is that you can see a credible scenario for the end of this,\u201d he said. \u201cEven if it's a partial deployment, even if people just understand, OK, we\u2019ve got the vaccine, that's going to change behavior. The psychology of this is pretty important.\u201d\n\nFor investors, psychology is everything. Harvey won\u2019t say the stock market has hit bottom; he thinks there could be more selloffs if there are setbacks to vaccine development or if the economic damage is bigger than expected. But he\u2019s optimistic about the economy getting beyond what may well be a brief but brutal recession, largely because his favorite indicator \u2014 the yield curve \u2014 is positive now (with more than a little help from the Federal Reserve). \u201cIt's a leading indicator, and it's saying that we're coming out of recession,\" Harvey said. Let\u2019s hope he\u2019s as right about the recovery as he has been about recessions.\n\nHoward R. Gold is a MarketWatch columnist.

After new reported cases rose by about 1,000 per day in mid-April, they started to climb in May, reaching a new single-day high of about 1,450 on Thursday. While Texans moved more freely around the state after it allowed stores and restaurants to reopen on May 1 with capacity restrictions, the figures could reflect improving testing capacity. Cases are \"definitely increasing but it's not to the point where it's overwhelming our health care system,\" said Dr. Brian Reed, professor and chair of the department of clinical sciences at the University of Houston College of Medicine.\n\nWhen Texas partially rebooted its economy at the start of the month, it became the most populous state to do so up to that point. Along with the other largely Republican-led states that lifted restrictions designed to slow the pandemic in late April and early May, Texas looked to buoy a state economy wrecked after most businesses closed their doors. Texas will next allow businesses such as gyms to open on Monday with capacity limits.\n\nThe decision comes with immense risk. Experts say more freedom of movement leads to expectations of increased infections \u2014 though people's decisions to continue distancing and wear face coverings in public could limit the spread. This week, National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Director Dr. Anthony Fauci warned Congress that states could see \"little spikes that might turn into outbreaks\" if they restart their economies too soon.

Johannes Eisele | AFP via Getty Images\n\nThe prevailing mood in the markets right now is neither bullish nor bearish but rather befuddled. For investors, trying to gauge sentiment among other investors and traders is a constant undertaking, a way to sort out what bets are popular, which themes are played out and where lies the index direction that would cause the greatest surprise. Collecting all the readings together leads to a sense that the consensus is experiencing more confusion than conviction. And who can blame the crowd here. The S&P 500 experienced the fastest 30% drop from a record high in history, on a literally unprecedented intentional stoppage of most global commerce. From rarely seen panic levels and profoundly extreme oversold conditions, stocks snapped back in the fastest 35% rally in more than 80 years, regaining 60% of the decline but still without much support from improving real-time economic indicators.\n\nThe market has made a head-spinning round-trip, but in other ways has gone nowhere: The S&P has been sideways in a range for about a month near levels first reached in early 2018. About half of all large stocks are down more than 30% from their high, and yet in aggregate the S&P carries its highest valuation based on forecast one-year earnings since 2002. Those wishing to make a contrarian bullish case for stocks on the premise that most investors are too cautious can point to retail investor surveys and fund flows. The weekly American Association of Individual Investors poll last week showed bearish respondents numbered more than 50%, twice those saying they were bullish on stocks over the next six months. Bears have exceeded 50% for three of the last four weeks, quite unusual, especially when the S&P is pretty distant from its lows both in price and time. Source: AAII Investors pulled another $6 billion from equity funds in the latest week, according to fund tracker EPFR, taking the year-to-date net outflow to $40 billion. Meantime, an enormous $1.2 trillion has been moved out of risk assets and into money-market funds. This clearly shows longer-term public investors in a defensive posture.\n\nBut what about the pros?\n\nYet it's more a mixed picture when professional investors, tactical traders and market-based behavioral indicators are pulled into the frame. Strategists looking to make the case that the hot money has become a bit too greedy in the short term have cited a steep drop in the CBOE put/call ratio, which indicates declining demand for downside protection. While not at extreme lows \u2013 and this ratio popped higher during Thursday's choppy market sell-off \u2013 it certainly implies traders letting their guard down. Then there is the surge in new online-brokerage account openings among younger investors seizing on the big market drop, and those stuck at home and looking for action, described here last week. Many of the most popular stocks among clients of the beginner-focused investing app Robinhood are low-share-price name-brand stocks that have been hammered, along with speculative New Economy names such as Tesla. An influx of less-experienced investors is more a sign of frothiness than fearfulness, of course. And David Tepper, the billionaire investor and founder of Appaloosa Management, last week on CNBC noted \"pockets\" of excess in the market, including special-purpose acquisition vehicles (public companies that raise cash first and then search for a business to buy). Stocks that started this way include Virgin Galactic and DraftKings. Then there are the sentiment readings that are neutral, ambiguous or offsetting. The equity-exposure of the discretionary money managers in the National Association of Active Investment Management survey is around neutral, at 57% and in fact has receded from its rebound-rally highs.\n\nNational Association of Active Investment Management survey\n\nSource: NAAIM And the gauges constructed to capture risk appetites and investor positioning more broadly are in some disagreement.\n\nEuphoria?", "author": ["Michael Santoli"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/bankrupted-jc-penney-plans-to-spin-properties-into-new-real-estate-company.html", "published": "2020-05-16T21:38:16", "title": "Bankrupted JC Penney plans to spin its properties into separate real estate company", "text": "A piece of J.C. Penney's proposal to emerge from bankruptcy includes spinning its real estate into a publicly traded real estate investment trust.\n\nAs part of a plan filed with the bankruptcy court, Penney would reorganize into a new retailer (\"JCP\"), along with a REIT that would collect rent checks from the retail business. Court documents say as much as a 35% stake in the newly created REIT could be sold to a third-party investor to raise cash, or to provide additional funding for the REIT.\n\nWeighed down by a heavy debt load of more than $4 billion and hit hard by the coronavirus pandemic, Penney filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection Friday evening. Some are now questioning if the department store chain, which has been around for more than a century, should still operate. It has been stuck in a sales slump for years. The department store industry as a whole has also been on the demise, with people shifting their spending away from the mall. When Penney filed, it still operated roughly 850 locations at malls across the country.\n\nThis would not be the first time a struggling department store operator has relied on its real estate value to come up with liquidity. Sears in 2015 spun off roughly 250 properties to form the REIT Seritage Growth Properties.\n\n\"As soon as reasonably practicable,\" Penney will list common stock of the new JCP and the REIT on a national securities exchange, court documents say.\n\nPenney is also planning to do sale-leaseback deals for its distribution centers, according to the documents, which would help it raise more cash. Such a transaction entails selling real estate and leasing it back.

An 81,000-seat arena held just 213 players, coaches and officials for the first game after hiatus; players appeared to keep physical contact to a minimum; and police braced for unruly fans to gather outside, though none did, the AP reports.

Whether it's sneeze-shields and contactless payment at cashier stations or more online shopping and increased purchases of locally sourced goods, how we stock our refrigerators, freezers and pantries looks a lot different than it did just a few months ago. Food shopping stands ready to change even more, as grocers turn to ever more contact-free automation to get jobs done. Robots are restocking shelves and patrolling store aisles, for example, while newfangled \"dark stores\" are open only for pick-up of online orders. Some of the changes may fade as the coronavirus does, but others will remain. CNBC's Melissa Repko talks to those in the know. \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nA grocery store worker wears a mask while working in the meat department of a grocery store as the outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) continues in the Brooklyn borough of New York U.S., May 5, 2020.

At least seven Amazon employees have died from Covid-19. Today, Amazon should make its workforce's infection and death data public and allow its employees to make informed decisions about their own risk. \"Over the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. \u2026 They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day. \u2026 We're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is.\" \u2014 Elisabeth Butler Cordova\n\nA man wearing a face mask holds a box of the American electronic commerce company Amazon in Central district, Hong Kong.

Sunniva Sorby, 59, and Hilde F\u00e5lulm Str\u00f8m, 52, co-founders of the Hearts in the Ice polar education campaign, told NBC that their several decades of research experience is \"reassuring\" and allows them to \"navigate the challenges of storms, aggressive polar bears and endless hours of darkness.\" The virus has postponed vital climate research and data collection worldwide, and scientists fear a long-term hit to their research budgets. The Arctic explorers, who have been collecting weather and wildlife data as well as motoring clouds and sea ice, said the silver lining of being stranded is that they can continue working even as other research is on hold. \u2014 Emma Newburger\n\nLaid off thanks to Covid-19?

The Great Recession had already made retirement more difficult, forcing many seniors to stay in the workforce long after they reached 65. Now that Granny's likely been laid off from her shift at the bookstore, what's she supposed to do? CNBC's Annie Nova spoke with labor economist Teresa Ghilarducci, who leads the Retirement Equity Lab at The New School in New York, about why older Americans are particularly vulnerable in the current recession. They also talk about how the pandemic has exposed the real risks inherent in our current retirement paradigm. \u2014 Kenneth Kiesnoski\n\nTrump plans to restore a bit of WHO's funding\n\n9:50 am ET \u2014 President Donald Trump on Saturday said that the U.S. intends to restore 10% of its funding to the World Health Organization, though he noted that no official decision has been made. Trump suspended funding to the WHO on April 14 after criticizing the agency's response to the coronavirus outbreak and accusing it of promoting China's \"disinformation\" about the virus.

The Republican-led Senate opposes the Democrat-led House's legislation, and the White House has pledged to veto it in any case. The historic spending proposal includes nearly $1 trillion for state and local governments; a second distribution of direct payments worth $1,200 per person and up to $6,000 per household; hazard pay of $200 billion for essential workers; and $75 billion in virus testing efforts, among other things.

Instead, customers are getting used to new grocery store fixtures: Mask-wearing employees, plexiglass barriers at cash registers, one-way aisles and antibacterial wipe dispensers. Some of those will become the norm. Others will fade away as coronavirus cases decline. But many analysts predict the pandemic will change how customers stock their fridges and pantries and shape their expectations in the months or years ahead. Here's a round-up of five changes sparked by the pandemic:\n\nNo touching, please\n\nGetty Images\n\nCustomers are more squeamish about germs \u2014 and that could linger. Grocers and other retailers have touted new and expanded contactless approaches to shop or check out. Walmart, for example, added a new feature to its smartphone app that allows customers to scan a QR code instead of touching a screen at the cash register. Other apps, such as Apple Pay and Google Pay, also allow customers to skip the credit card reader. With curbside pickup, customers can pop the trunk instead of going into stores. Some retailers have waived the need for a signature when people pick up groceries or get a delivery to their home. Some customers are opting for prepackaged goods, as they skip the deli counter and other parts of the store with additional food handling, said Jill Standish, Accenture's global head of retail. She said the grab-and-go items also shorten shoppers' time in stores, another common preference. Those approaches may stick because of their convenience, along with heightened safety.\n\n'Go local' trend on steroids\n\nProduce at an Arkansas farmer's market dlewis33 | iStock | Getty Images\n\nLong before the pandemic, customers bought fruits and vegetables at farmers markets and supported local businesses, such as cheese shops. The pandemic is accelerating that trend, said Scott McKenzie, Nielsen's head of global intelligence. Now, he said, people gravitate even more to products grown or made closer to home. They're thinking about the long distances that produce, meat and other foods may travel and the borders they may cross before arriving to their kitchen table \u2014 and the many people who may touch them along the way. That's driving more interest in subscriptions to farm boxes and items with \"a shorter supply chain,\" McKenzie said. \"I call this the phenomenon of buying milk from cows you can see,\" he said.\n\nShift to online shopping accelerates\n\nGetty Images\n\nGrocery shoppers have downloaded new grocery apps and tried new online services. Those discoveries have shaken up habits and could lead to a meaningful shift in an industry that's been slow to go digital. Customers have used third-party delivery services, such as Instacart, FreshDirect and Target-owned Shipt, to get groceries. They've also ordered online and used curbside or in-store pickup at Walmart and Target. Only about 3% or 4% of grocery spending in the U.S. was online before the coronavirus outbreak, according to research by consulting firm Bain & Company. That could increase to between 5% and 10% after it, said Steve Caine, a retail expert and partner for the firm.\n\nA personal touch by 'pickers'\n\nInstacart employee Monica Ortega checks her cellphone for orders while picking up groceries from a supermarket for delivery on March 19, 2020 in North Hollywood, California. Frederic J. Brown | AFP via Getty Images\n\nGrocers will look for creative ways to strengthen relationships with customers and entice them to add more to their virtual baskets, as more customers shop online in addition to in-store. Employees who fulfill and bag online orders at stores \u2014 often called pickers or shoppers \u2014 will become increasingly important and could become a competitive advantage for retailers, said Eiko Kawano, a group experience director for digital consulting firm, Publicis Sapient. Grocers may use the employees as brand ambassadors and suggestive sellers, she said. Stores could ask pickers to upload a photo or a brief profile and allow customers to rate the pickers like Uber and Lyft drivers. Through a combination of personal relationships and algorithms, the shopper or picker could personalize customers' orders by recommending an item. And they could nudge customers towards higher margin items and discretionary purchases, too.\n\nThe rise of the robot\n\nHumanoid robot \"Prepper\" stands on April 2, 2020 at the cash desk of a supermarket of the Edeka retail chain in Lindlar, Germany, to explain protective measures and to promote solidarity with each other, amid the novel coronavirus / COVID-19 pandemic.

By her calculations, the pandemic will force another 3.1 million older workers into poverty in their retirement, with many forced to choose between their health and their need for a paycheck.\n\nCNBC spoke with Ghilarducci about why older Americans are particularly vulnerable to this recession, and what the pandemic's fallout has revealed to us about the risks of our current retirement system.\n\nThe interview has been condensed and edited for clarity.\n\nCNBC: How do you see this recession impacting older workers and retirement differently than previous recessions?\n\nTeresa Ghilarducci: The unemployment rate. It's going up among older workers faster than any other group, except for the very young. They probably won't get back into the labor force, or it'll take them a long time to get another job. That means they'll draw down on their retirement savings, they may go into debt and they'll also apply for Social Security earlier, forgoing increased benefits. As a result, people who are middle-class workers now will be poor or near-poor retirees for the rest of their lives.\n\nMore from Personal Finance:\n\nHere's where people are turning for cash\n\nPayment apps may pose a coronavirus scam threat\n\nMillennials double down on emergency savings\n\nCNBC: Why are so many older Americans being thrown out of work during the pandemic?\n\nTG: It has to do with the jobs they were in. Education and health care, health care that wasn't involved with Covid care: dentist offices, optometrist offices, home health care, these are jobs that were all lost in the last couple of months and were disproportionately filled by older workers, and older women, by the way. Women have been harder hit than men in the Covid recession, and older women especially.\n\nCNBC: Why is it harder for older workers who've lost their jobs to get re-hired than it is for younger workers? And how could the pandemic exacerbate the problem?\n\nTG: There's the sense that older workers don't have the skills or potential that younger workers have and, in most cases, that's an irrational, discriminatory prejudice. But in this recession, caused by the pandemic, there may be a rational basis for the age discrimination. Older workers coming back to work may face much worse health hazards, and they will need special accommodations by their employers. The employer of an older worker may be concerned about their health and the liability associated with not providing a safe working place.", "author": ["Annie Nova"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/jc-penneys-future-depends-on-what-happens-over-the-next-two-months.html", "published": "2020-05-16T23:10:06", "title": "JC Penney's future depends on what happens over the next two months", "text": "An empty parking lot is seen outside a closed JC Penney Co. store in Mt. Juliet, Tennessee, U.S., on Thursday, April 16, 2020.\n\nIt's not typical for a bankruptcy court hearing to fall on a Saturday, and it's nearly unprecedented for it to happen by phone.\n\nBut as the coronavirus has battered the U.S. economy, J.C. Penney must navigate almost entirely uncharted territory as it looks to shed debt and emerge from bankruptcy a stronger company. The iconic retailer filed for bankruptcy on Friday weighed down with $4.9 billion in debt and crushed by government mandates that ordered its stores shut.\n\nJ.C Penney's financial and legal advisors called into the United States Bankruptcy Court for the Southern District of Houston, Corpus Christi Division to make their first-day statements. At the conclusion of the hearing, Judge David Jones authorized the retailer to continue paying non-furloughed associate wages, provide certain benefits to all associates, and to pay vendor partners in the ordinary course for all goods and services provided on or after the Chapter 11 filing date.\n\nLaw firm Kirkland & Ellis' Josh Sussberg started the hearing by walking the judge through the chain's iconic history \u2014 starting from its founding under the vision of James Penney, through its rise as a go-to department store for suburban America, and its lost footing as it churned through CEOs and battled the rise of online retail.\n\nHe said the company had already begun to chip at its heavy debt load in order to usher in a turnaround envisioned by CEO Jill Soltau, who joined the company in 2018. But anyone, he said, who dismissed coronavirus as the main reason for landing in bankruptcy court was wrong.\n\n\"You are dead wrong,\" he said. \"This is absolutely about the coronavirus, this is about a governmental shutdown and about us all being in video chat for this hearing.\"\n\nThe retailer had, in fact, been in discussions about transactions to address its debt load prior to the pandemic, said CFO Bill Wafford in a court declaration.\n\n\"Unfortunately, once COVID-19 was declared a pandemic, and the Company's primary revenue stream in-store sales evaporated overnight, talks regarding the potential transactions came to a grinding halt,\" he said.\n\nSussberg described for court the $900 million bankruptcy financing the company has secured, which includes $450 million in new money from its fist-lien lenders, most of which are hedge funds.\n\nThat money, though, will not be made available to J.C. Penney all at once. The company will likely receive the first half after a June court hearing and the second half on July 15. But it will only receive that second half to support its business if it meets milestones required of it by its bankruptcy lenders. Otherwise, the funds will go towards funding a potential sale. Kirkland's Sussberg said J.C. Penney has already begun to receive outside interest in the company.\n\nAccording to documents filed with the court, if the company does not have the support of two-thirds of its bankruptcy lenders for a business plan by July 15, or binding commitments from third parties to finance those plans by August 15, it must \"immediately cease pursuing the plan\" and instead pursue a sale of its assets.\n\nThat structure makes the next 60 days crucial to determining J.C Penney's fate in its current form. And in those two months, the country will face some of the greatest uncertainty in decades, as questions around the country's ability to defeat the virus and reopen the country remain unanswered.\n\nRetail sales in April plunged a shocking 16.4%, worse than the 12.3% expected by economists. The Labor Department reported a loss of 20.5 million jobs in April.\n\nJ.C Penney has outlined the strategy the company will pursue in that time. It will focus on customer service, apparel and low prices. It will open select stores and continue to offer contact-free curbside pickup service at all open stores. Its e-commerce distribution will continue to fulfill online orders.\n\nThe retailer is also weighing a plan by which it would split the company into two separate publicly traded companies, one of them being a real estate investment trust. It has also said it will \"reduce its store footprint\" in phases. CNBC previously reported that the retailer is making plans to close 180-200 stores.\n\nThe challenges of continuing a turnaround against the backdrop of a pandemic was one that even the judge acknowledged.\n\n\"I am very worried about this, this is why I'm having a hearing on a Saturday,\" said Judge Jones to 300 other people on the line.\n\n\"When retailers are prohibited to have people come into the store,\" said Jones, \"it's hard to make money.\"\n\nCNBC's Lauren Thomas contributed to this report.", "author": ["Lauren Hirsch"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/coronavirus-nearly-killed-this-young-bronx-man.html", "published": "2020-05-16T20:45:44", "title": "Coronavirus nearly took this young Bronx man's life, now the shutdown threatens his livelihood", "text": "Amaurys Grullon (L), founder of Bronx Native, and Josue Caceres (R), brand manager. Caceres caught coronavirus and was in a coma for 11 days. Spencer Kimball | CNBC\n\nJosue Caceres remembers waking up in a hospital bed. He tried to get up and go to the bathroom, but he was so weak he fell and hit his head.\n\n\n\nWhen he woke up from the fall, the doctor told him he had caught Covid-19, had gone into a coma for 11 days and was placed on a ventilator. Although his family has a history of high blood pressure, the 25-year-old Caceres is otherwise healthy. He still doesn't know how he caught the virus.\n\n\n\n\"I hardly went outside \u2014 I was taking this quarantine very serious,\" Caceres said. \"The few times I went out I had masks and gloves.\"\n\n\n\nIt started in late March when Caceres started to feel ill. He thought it was the flu and he just needed rest. But his mother, Dorka, became concerned when he started to complain of chest pain. She thought something might be wrong with his heart and decided to call 911. The EMT checked Caceres, said his heart was fine and decided against taking him to the hospital because he didn't display symptoms of the virus. But his condition quickly deteriorated after the EMT visit as he started experiencing severe shortness of breath. \"I couldn't breathe \u2014 I was literally just gasping for air,\" Caceres said. \" I would just take a few steps and it felt like I ran a marathon.\" His mother and brother saw how ill he suddenly looked and called the ambulance again. That's around the time Caceres went unconscious. His family wasn't able to visit him while he was hospitalized and intubated due to protocols to prevent the virus from spreading. Caceres' lungs and kidneys weren't functioning properly. During those 11 days, his mother Dorka feared for his life and would call the hospital constantly to check on his condition.\n\n\n\n\"I truly feel like if I was alone I probably would have died because I wasn't aware of anything \u2014 I couldn't do anything,\" Caceres said.\n\n'It just hit home'\n\nCaceres lives in the Bronx, one of the hardest-hit boroughs in the hardest-hit city in the U.S. More than 42,000 people have tested positive for coronavirus in the Bronx and at least 3,293 have died from Covid-19 as of Friday. Every day brings more death and infections.\n\n\n\nPeople are fighting for their lives and their livelihoods as the virus rips through the borough and businesses deemed nonessential by the state have remained closed for eight weeks now in an effort to contain the epidemic. The Bronx is particularly vulnerable to the public health and economic crises triggered by the virus. The borough has the lowest health outcomes in New York state and has high rates of asthma and diabetes. The number of people living in poverty is the highest in New York City at 27%. Amaurys Grullon, 27, was tired of the stereotypes he always heard about his home when growing up. In 2016, Grullon founded a business called Bronx Native to showcase the borough's culture and creativity. He asked Caceres, his childhood friend, to join the business as brand manager and help run the store.\n\nA man walks past a wall mural in the Mott Haven neighborhood of the Bronx. May, 14 2020. Spencer Kimball | CNBC\n\n\"For me the Bronx is the most beautiful place on Earth \u2014 I wanted to change the narrative,\" Grullon said. The store, located in Mott Haven, sells apparel, accessories and acts as community space to the neighborhood, hosting everything from comedy to financial literacy classes. Business was good until the pandemic, Grullon said. They had to close the shop's doors when the state declared their business nonessential, and sales fell 50% even as the store has ramped up its online business to compensate, Grullon said. Then, as the business was in turmoil, Caceres caught the virus.\n\n\n\nGrullon knew something was wrong when Caceres wasn't responding to his messages. He contacted Caceres' mother, who told him his friend had fallen into a coma.\n\n\n\n\"When I heard that news \u2014 it's when I really realized this is serious,\" Grullon said. \"Josue is a young kid, 25 \u2014 younger than me. It just hit home, and when things hit home they hit differently.\"\n\n'We're in a very difficult position'\n\nCaceres' lungs started responding, his condition started to improve and he was taken off intubation. He survived the virus and is healthy now, but it's unclear if Bronx Native will survive the shutdown. Grullon has applied for a small business loan through the federal Paycheck Protection Program to help keep the store afloat. Grullon originally tried to apply through Chase, but he heard from other business owners he might have a better shot with a smaller community bank. He applied at Ponce Bank and also through PayPal. Unlike Chase, neither Ponce nor Paypal require applicants to have existing accounts, which has made it easier for many small businesses to apply.\n\n\n\nUnderstanding the program and its rules, navigating the application and getting the right documents together in such a short time was frustrating. Grullon said he was totally in the dark when he first started looking into applying for funding a month ago. Bronx Native has since been approved for a $25,000 loan through Paypal. Small businesses like Bronx Native initially struggled to get their applications processed amid the confusion and technical problems that plagued the rollout of the program, while a number of publicly traded companies who were clients of big banks were approved for loans before the first round of money ran out.\n\n\n\nWhen the program reopened with more funding, $30 billion was set aside for smaller lenders. The idea was to get money to underserved communities and minority business owners. The $30 billion ran out in less than two days, according to Kenneth Kelly, chairman of the National Bankers Association, which represents minority-owned banks.\n\nThe Bronx Chamber of Commerce is worried the retail vacancy rate will skyrocket due to the shutdown caused by the pandemic. Spencer Kimball | US\n\nA government watchdog found minority and women-owned businesses may not have received loans because the Small Business Administration did not tell lenders to prioritize underserved communities as called for under the law.\n\n\n\nLisa Sorin, president of the Bronx Chamber of Commerce, said few businesses in the borough received money during the first round of lending. The problem, Sorin said, is the Paycheck Protection Program defines a small business as 500 or fewer employees. But in the Bronx most businesses have fewer than 10 employees, which means they are competing with much larger and better equipped companies for money.\n\n\n\nMore businesses in the Bronx started to get funding when the program set aside money for smaller banks, Sorin said, but it's still not enough to meet the needs of the 23,000 businesses in the borough. Sorin is concerned the pandemic will force scores of businesses to close for good, ending a period of progress in which unemployment had fallen to historic lows and the number of businesses reached a four-decade high.\n\n\n\nMany business districts in the Bronx are projecting retail vacancy rates as high as 50% by August, according to Michael Brady, executive director of the Third Avenue Business Improvement District. \"That's taking us back to the mid-'90s when the vacancy rate was out of control,\" Sorin said, \"and that's a very scary position to be in when we were in an upward curve for the borough.\" Grullon said he can breathe a little easier now that he received funding after weeks of trying, but getting approved brings its own challenges. PPP loans are turned into grants if borrowers use 75% of the money for payroll among other conditions, one reason why the loans are in such high demand. Grullon wants to make sure he has a plan in place to meet those guidelines so he doesn't end up with a more than $1,300 monthly loan payment on top of his other costs. When he was still uncertain if funding would come through, Grullon started a GoFundMe campaign with a goal to raise $20,000 to help pay rent, utilities and vendors. He said the community has been supportive, and the GoFundMe money acts as a cushion during uncertain times.\n\n\n\n\"We are in a very difficult position right now because it's a very uncertain time,\" Grullon said. \"Everyday we're trying to figure out ways to adapt.\"\n\n'This was an older person's disease'\n\nThe crisis hit home for Noelle Santos when she heard that Caceres, her friend, was in a coma. Santos owns The Lit. Bar, a bookstore and bar, around the corner from Bronx Native.\n\n\n\n\"We were told this was an older person's disease and the younger people were just keeping the older safe,\" Santos said. \"Once our friend in his mid-20s got sick and he was in a coma for 11 days fighting for his life \u2014 that really shook us up.\" Santos knew the situation was getting serious before Caceres fell ill. She voluntarily closed The Lit. Bar a few days before the state ordered nonessential businesses to do so. Santos was worried about the health and safety of her customers after the state first told businesses to operate at reduced capacity to help control the outbreak.\n\n\n\n\"They were leaving it up to me to protect people and I didn't feel confident in my ability to do that,\" she said.\n\nNoelle Santos opened Lit. Bar in April of 2019 after the closing of Barnes & Noble left the Bronx without a general interest bookstore.

Alexi Rosenfeld | Getty Images\n\nSanitation workers across the country are trying to adjust to unusually high waste levels in residential areas as the coronavirus pandemic shuts in much of the workforce at home. Waste in residential areas has spiked by as much as 40% in some parts of the country, according to one company's tally. To facilitate curbside pickup services, waste management companies are urging both their workers and clients to follow proper disposal protocols. To deal with the onslaught, some sanitation workers, who pick up and haul garbage and other waste, have begun to double or triple the number of trips they would make to residential neighborhoods under more normal circumstances. Often taken for granted, sanitation workers have become part of the frontline workforce keeping the country going even as the pandemic persists. And though they largely operate in the background of everyday life, they provide services that bolster comfortable living and cleanliness across the country. \"You can go your whole life without ever calling upon a firefighter or a police officer, but you can't go more than a couple days without having a sanitation worker in your life,\" said Belinda Mager, the director of communications at New York's sanitation department. \"They visit your block at least a couple days a week, and you may not even know it! But you'd know it if they were not there!\" Data collected in December from the Bureau of Labor Statistics show that people who gather and dispose of waste and recyclable materials work the fifth most dangerous job in the United States. The coronavirus has heightened that risk factor. The pandemic adds to the inherent dangers of the job the risk of contracting the disease while handling waste with contaminated materials such as used tissues or face masks. This story is based on conversations with people linked to six waste removal groups in New York, California, Texas, Florida and Arizona, five states that represent some of the greatest risk zones for sanitation workers.\n\nThe risks\n\nIn an effort to minimize employees' risk of contracting the disease, several waste removal groups have been urging the public to dispose of their waste safely by \"putting all trash in closed bags, carts or containers,\" said David Biderman, executive director and CEO of Solid Waste Association of North America, or SWANA, a nonprofit that advocates for efficient solid waste management. \"We don't want sanitation collection workers touching discarded tissues or other material from a home in which someone has tested positive to coronavirus,\" Biderman said. Some companies, such as Florida-based Waste Pro USA, have issued guidance on how to handle waste. The company created a flyer that educates \"customers on how to properly dispose of their trash and recycling to protect themselves and our crews that is available to download on our website\" said Ron Pecora, senior vice president of Waste Pro USA, which operates in 11 states. Increased safety protocols have also extended to the companies themselves. Sanitation workers have received gloves, masks, and disinfecting products from their employers to maximize their own safety. And they're encouraged to practice social distancing while collecting trash. \"Traditionally everyone always wore gloves. But now everyone wears a thinner latex glove on the inside, in addition to a thick glove on the outside,\" said Josh Eisenstein, director of community outreach at Filco Carting, a Brooklyn, New York, waste management company.\n\nSanitation workers clean and disinfect the streets of Skidrow during the coronavirus pandemic on April 20, 2020 in Los Angeles, California. Tommaso Boddi | Getty Images\n\nTrucks are cleaned and disinfected frequently, said a spokesperson from Republic Services, an Arizona-based waste collection company operating in 41 states and Puerto Rico. \"All of our facilities and equipment are on an enhanced cleaning schedule, with cleanings scheduled multiple times per day,\" the spokesperson said. In Arizona, the new safety protocols have extended into processing centers, too, where employees are separated by \"plastic protective barriers to help keep them safe.\" SWANA estimates that nearly 1,000 sanitation workers have tested positive for the coronavirus around the country, \"the majority of them in the New York City metropolitan area,\" Biderman said. But it's likely that these workers contracted the virus because of \"community spread, not contact with the trash,\" he added.\n\nSpikes in residential waste\n\nWaste among residential homes has increased as most Americans stay at home under shelter-in-place orders. \"Residential waste volume has increased between 5% to 35%, depending on the location, as Americans have been staying home and generating more trash and recyclables,\" Biderman said. At Waste Management, headquartered in Texas, residential waste went up by 25%, according to Janette Micelli, director of external affairs. To keep up with the unexpected volume of waste, several sanitation companies have suspended bulk pick-up services, meaning that sanitation workers temporarily avoid picking up large materials like tossed-out furniture. About 80 communities nationwide have reported temporary suspensions in curbside recycling or yard waste collection, according to estimates from SWANA. \"This was because these communities' sanitation departments have limited bandwidth and resources, and need to use their assets (trucks, people) to collect trash,\" Biderman explained. Some communities have begun to resume these services. In Southern California, sanitation workers have shut down some recycling facilities due to inability to keep adequate distance between workers, causing some curbside recyclables to end up in the landfill. Meanwhile, some companies have altered their schedules to keep up with the increased need for waste removal. Shelter-in-place guidelines have caused Americans to be \"thrown off their routine,\" said Pecora of Waste Pro USA, which has seen a 40% increase in residential waste in some areas. \"Rather than placing their materials out before going to work, they have been placing their materials out after our trucks have serviced their streets, resulting in a spike in calls concerning missed pickups,\" Pecora said. Additionally, Waste Pro USA workers have been reporting higher numbers of \"bulk items,\" including old televisions and mattresses, in Florida. It is an indication that many Americans are using the time at home to do some heavy-duty spring cleaning. \"This huge volume has resulted in significant increased expense as trucks are filling up and have to dispose, and then go back to same routes to complete,\" Pecora said.\n\nCommercial waste falls\n\nAs residential waste rises, commercial waste is in a state of free fall, tumbling because of closures of nonessential businesses and stay-at-home guidelines. The biggest blow to commercial waste occurred \"in major cities,\" according to SWANA's Biderman. Filco Carting in Brooklyn has seen commercial waste drop by 50% since the pandemic hit. Commercial waste removal from places like restaurants and small businesses can only be handled by privately owned waste removal companies in New York. Once New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo issued orders of statewide shutdowns, business at New York waste removal companies began to drop off. \"Most private carters are operating with less trucks, as many customers are not operating, not producing waste and therefore less trucks are needed to collect the reduced waste,\" said Eisenstein of Filco. And businesses that have stayed open to offer essential services, like supermarkets, have reduced their waste, Eisenstein said, likely because fewer customers have been entering. Some of these businesses \"requested reduction in their frequency of pickups. Weeks ago when businesses were forced to close, many reached out to us to suspend service,\" he said.\n\nGoing forward", "author": ["Yelena Dzhanova"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/chinese-rocket-falls-to-earth-space-debris-problem-worsens.html", "published": "2020-05-16T15:30:01", "title": "A Chinese rocket weighing 18 tons falls to Earth as space junk crisis hits a tipping point", "text": "In this May 5, 2020, file photo released by Xinhua News Agency, China's new large carrier rocket Long March 5B blasts off from the Wenchang Space Launch Center in southern China's Hainan Province. Tu Haichao | Xinhua | AP\n\nSince humans first went up in space in 1961, we've done a poor job of keeping it clean. NASA currently estimates that there are some 21,000 pieces of space junk larger than a softball orbiting the Earth and 500,000 pieces of debris the size of a marble or larger. Since the debris travels at speeds of up to 17,500 mph, they could damage a satellite or spacecraft. Just last week an 18-ton Chinese rocket passed over Los Angeles and New York City's Central Park before falling into the Atlantic Ocean. The estimated 8,800 tons of objects that humans have left in space are becoming a danger. Near misses are common these days. Last September there was one between Elon Musk's SpaceX satellite and one from the European Space Agency. But so far, there has been just one major collision: In 2009 American satellite Iridium 33 and Cosmos 2251, a Russian satellite, crashed, destroying both over northern Siberia. In January a satellite run by AT&T's DirecTV was found to be in danger of exploding and needed to be moved or else it could harm other satellites. Since that time, no action has been taken. Meanwhile, in late April the FCC voted to require more disclosures from satellite operators seeking licenses but declined to introduce any new laws governing the removal of orbital debris.\n\nCompanies rush to address the problem\n\nAccording to experts, the problem is projected to get worse. By 2025 as many as 1,100 satellites could be launching each year. The number of satellites orbiting Earth is projected to quadruple over the next decade. Astroscale, one of the few companies whose mission is to clean up such space debris, is leading the charge to clean up our space pathways and avoid collisions among the objects that humans recently have left in space. The Japanese company is currently working with Japan's Aerospace Exploration Agency (JAXA) to carry out the agency's Commercial Removal of Debris Demonstration (CRD2) project.\n\nKanae Kobori, an engineer with Japanese space start-up company Astroscale, demonstrates pulling a magnet off of a piece of steel during the 35th Space Symposium at The Broadmoor in Colorado Springs, Colorado on April 9, 2019.

The goal of the mission is to launch a satellite that will observe and acquire data on the rocket upper stage that the second phase will seek to deorbit. The idea is to find out how the debris moves in space and set up a safe and successful removal. Astroscale is not alone in seeking to clean up space debris. Northrop Grumman last year launched its first Mission Extension Vehicle spacecraft (MEV-1) to prove it could intercept falling satellites, repair them, remove them from traffic and put them back in orbit. Swiss start-up ClearSpace, meanwhile, has a more specific goal: to remove a 100kg Vega Secondary Payload Adapter (Vespa) upper-stage rocket orbiting around 400 miles above Earth. It plans to do that in 2025.\n\nPetrovich9 | Getty Images\n\nA NASA spokesperson noted that solving the issue will take cooperation between nations. \"The remediation of the near-Earth space environment will necessarily involve not only a multi-agency approach but an international effort,\" said J.D. Harrington, public affairs officer at NASA. Harrington estimated that the U.S. was responsible for less than a third of all the detritus. Tom Wilson, vice president of Northrop Grumman space systems, said the company is pioneering the market for in-space satellite servicing and logistics services with its Mission Extension Vehicle. \"Our efforts are driven by our customers' needs to protect their space assets,\" he said. \"MEV provides a roadmap for a broader range of servicing,\" he said.

It would be built around scientifically novel but increasingly available means to prevent future pandemics through constructing a \"global immune system.\"\n\nDavid Bray, the director of the Atlantic Council's GeoTech Center, launched this year to help harness emerging technologies for good, has been pioneering the concept of a \"Pandemic Prevention Board\" as a significant first step. He likens the system to a previous time when the public \"had to be convinced there was a need to install smoke detectors in large buildings linked to the fire department and automatic sprinkler systems to put out the fire.\"\n\nThe PPB initially would be an industry-driven answer to the now-obvious need, in the words of Bill Gates, for world leaders to \"take what has been learned from this tragedy and invest in systems to prevent future outbreaks.\" Gates, writing in the New England Journal of Medicine, laid it out this way: \"We need to save lives now while also improving the way we respond to outbreaks in general. The first point is more pressing, but the second has crucial long-term consequences.\"\n\nThe involvement of global governments would be essential, in the best case by planting seeds as early as the U.S.-hosted G7 summit on June 10 or the Saudi-hosted G20 meeting on July 18 or at the United Nations General Assembly in September. The dream outcome would be that public and private sectors worldwide would join hands urgently in a multi-faceted and coordinated effort that would produce a truly \"new world order\" out of our existing Covid-19 chaos.\n\nDon't hold your breath for that kumbaya moment.\n\nIf this period has taught us anything it is that our political leaders of 2020 mostly were ill-prepared for the virus. Their responses thus far haven't been sufficiently cooperative, coordinated or pro-active to meet the historic challenge. With China and the United States on a collision course that's only likely to accelerate ahead of November's US elections, an industry-initiated approach could kick-start some tension-reducing collaboration, also among political leaders.\n\nThe PPB would represent an alliance of technology companies focused on advancing solutions to safeguard against future low probability, high consequence pandemics \u2013 either naturally occurring or manually designed. Though experts are afraid to say this out loud and thus tempt fate, the Covid-19 impact has also impressed terrorist and extremist groups about the low-cost, high-impact destructive power of pathogens.\n\nIn Bray's plan, the board's flagship initiative would center around the concept of building an \"immune system for the planet\" that could detect a novel pathogen in the air, water or soil and rapidly sequence its DNA or RNA. This detection would then trigger rapid sequencing to fully characterize the pathogen. Once sequenced, high performance computers would strive to identify both the three-dimensional protein surfaces of either the virus or bacteria and then search through an index of known molecular therapies that might be able to neutralize the pathogen.\n\nThe exponential reduction of the time required to take on a biothreat agent would save lives, property and national economies. With advances in biosensors, the Internet of Things and high-performance computing, it's not so far-fetched to imagine real-time data collection to identify problems early and guide responses.\n\nHowever, before getting too lost in the technologies that could make such a system work, it's worth reflecting on the cruel lessons of history that should shift even the harshest critics of multilateral collaboration into a more collaborative spirit to advance global resilience against future waves of the Covid-19 virus and future pandemics.\n\nIt is essential we do this, finding a way to collaborate across nations and business sectors, while we still have the chance.\n\nI've been rereading two books in the past days that richly relate history's lessons, must-reading for today's leaders.\n\nMargaret Macmillan's \"Paris 1919\" illustrates how the United States and its European partners failed the test after World War I; Dean Acheson's \"Present at the Creation\" chronicles in great detail how, chastened by that experience, President Harry Truman and others used the post-World War II years to construct an international order that has delivered more than seven decades of growing prosperity and relative peace among major powers.\n\nParis 1919 \"is a study of flawed decisions with terrible consequences, many of which haunt us to this day,\" writes the late Richard Holbrooke in the book's foreword. A single paragraph can't settle the debate over President Woodrow Wilson's degree of blame for that failure. He had plenty of accomplices among the U.S. and international leaders of those times. However, what followed is undeniable: nationalism, fascism, the Holocaust and World War II.\n\n\"Present at the Creation\" is about a post-war challenge, writes Acheson, that was \"just a bit less formidable than that described in the first chapter of Genesis. That was to create a world out of chaos; ours, to create half a world, a free half, out of the same material without blowing the whole to pieces in the process. The wonder of it is how much was done.\"\n\nThat leaves today's leaders to either watch the existing, rules-based global order \u2013 with all its flaws and dysfunctions \u2013 tear apart under the coronavirus strain. Or they can search for ways to finish Acheson's half-complete job by creating something more inclusive, drawing upon public health as an indisputable common cause.\n\nThat could advance the concept of a world where the U.S. and China continue to compete fiercely in large number of other areas, but where at the same time they show they can collaborate as well. That would begin with collaborative efforts to keep their citizens healthy from future novel pathogens, but they at the same time could establish habits that serve other concerns ranging from climate and trade to avoiding a modern-age superpower war with devastating consequences.\n\n\"Washington's sins of omission and Beijing's sins of commission have conspired to sideline international institutions, helping frustrate their common goal of ending the pandemic,\" write Thomas R. Pickering and Atman M. Trivedi this week in Foreign Affairs.\n\nThey point to previous times when the U.S. and China engaged in cooperative research and shared information to combat SARS and the avian flu in 2003, the swine flu in 2009, and the Ebola virus in 2014. During the Cold War, they write, Moscow and Washington \"quietly collaborated on polio and smallpox vaccines.\"\n\nIt may seem hopelessly na\u00efve to expect an even more ambitious degree of global collaboration now, but history's lesson is that the alternatives are horrifying.\n\nFrederick Kempe is a best-selling author, prize-winning journalist and president & CEO of the Atlantic Council, one of the United States' most influential think tanks on global affairs.

Unofficial tallies, mostly tracked by concerned Amazon employees who receive text message alerts whenever one of their colleagues catches the coronavirus, peg the total number of cases at 900 or more.\n\nThere could easily be more deaths and infections within Amazon's walls, but the company has declined to disclose the impact the pandemic has had on its employees. Instead, Amazon has only verified deaths when they're dug up by members of the media, leaving us with a fuzzy picture at best as to how dangerous this work actually is.\n\nAmazon disagrees. In an interview with \"60 Minutes\" on May 10, Amazon's operations boss David Clark said disclosing the number of \"isn't particularly useful,\" and instead said the focus should be on the rate of cases relative to the number of workers in a warehouse and the communities in which they live. Amazon hasn't disclosed that rate either.\n\nAmazon should release the number of infections and deaths among its workforce, or, at the very least, figures that show the rate of the infections inside its warehouses.\n\nOur notion of an \"essential worker\" has dramatically changed since the start of the pandemic. It's not just doctors, nurses, police officers, firefighters and members of the military. In the time of the coronavirus, the definition has expanded to include sanitation workers, grocery store clerks, food-delivery workers and warehouse workers who ship goods ordered online.\n\nOver the last few months, we've called these workers heroes. We've asked them to show up to work amid a deadly pandemic that has already killed at least 86,000 people and affected at least 1.4 million in the U.S. They're working in crowded buildings, behind checkout counters shielded with plexiglass and in hotspots like New York City where the virus continues to spread and kill hundreds of people per day.\n\nWe're asking them to do it all without a clear picture of just how dangerous the work actually is. We're asking them to choose between no paycheck and putting their lives at risk. We're asking them to do all this just to keep the basic standard of living we've become accustomed to humming as a virus ravages the country.\n\nIf Amazon disclosed its infection and death data, it would provide valuable insight not just to workers who need to make decisions about their paychecks and health, but also to employers grappling with the same issues as Amazon.\n\nAs other businesses slowly begin to open again across the country, they'll need all the help they can get to make sure they're protecting their workers and customers, just like the essential businesses who have been operating through the pandemic have done. There are lessons to learn, but those lessons become more difficult without the data.\n\nAmazon's biggest rival in retail, Walmart, also has a slew of reported Covid-19 cases and deaths, but has routinely declined to disclose its own data and faces a wrongful death lawsuit from the family of one of its employees who died from the coronavirus. Other horror stories have cropped up in essential businesses from Tyson meat plants to grocery store chains like Costco and Kroger that are grappling with long lines and customers angry over social distancing rules.\n\nAmazon has proven it can be a leader. For example, in October 2018, Amazon announced it would raise its minimum wage to $15 per hour. But Amazon went further than just raising wages. It also said it would advocate to bring the federal minimum wage up to the same standard, and CEO Jeff Bezos dared other large employers to do the same.\n\n\"We listened to our critics, thought hard about what we wanted to do, and decided we want to lead,\" Bezos said in a statement at the time. \"We're excited about this change and encourage our competitors and other large employers to join us.\"\n\nNow it's time for Amazon to lead again. It's an icon of American industry, like General Electric and General Motors were decades ago. It's the company many businesses admire and look to for guidance. Through its innovation and relentless drive, Amazon has earned the burden of setting the standard for how business works in this country.\n\nSo far, Amazon has done a great job talking about the safety measures it has taken to protect its warehouse workers. It provides regular updates on its dedicated Covid-19 blog, which reads like a template for just about any large business grappling with how to safely operate during the pandemic. Face masks. Temperature checks. Social distancing. Hand sanitzer. Gloves. And so on. Amazon should be commended for moving as rapidly as it could to implement these changes throughout its sprawling logistics network. That's no small feat.\n\nOn top of that, Amazon said it plans to reinvest all of its profits this quarter -- an estimated $4 billion -- into its Covid-19 response. Hundreds of millions of dollars of that will go towards its own development of Covid-19 tests, a key to getting all of its employees safely back to work. It said it could spend $1 billion on testing alone this year. Compare that to the White House's response to the testing shortage.\n\nWorkers are scared, even as they do important work for pay that doesn't match up to the risk they're taking. Amazon has the opportunity to shine light on just how dangerous this work is by being the first major important to disclose its worker death and infection counts.\n\nHopefully others would then follow Amazon's lead.", "author": ["Steve Kovach"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/how-genetic-antibody-and-antigen-covid-19-tests-work.html", "published": "2020-05-15T16:00:01", "title": "How the three types of Covid-19 tests work and why each is important", "text": "There are three types of Covid-19 tests: genetic, antibody and antigen.

With summer just a little more than a month away, camp directors are still deciding if it's safe for camps to operate amid the coronavirus pandemic. And parents are equally concerned. On Thursday the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said camps should not reopen unless they are able to implement coronavirus screening protocols, evaluating employees and children daily for symptoms and potential past exposures to Covid-19. But compliance with the CDC direction will depend on whether states adopt the decision tools into their own local policies \u2014 and whether the Trump administration supports and promotes the agency's guidelines. State and local guidance is expected to be provided as early as next week. According to Former FDA Commissioner Scott Gottlieb, we are \"still in the early innings\" of the coronavirus crisis, but if it were up to him, he would choose to send his kids to a sleepaway camp over a day camp. At CNBC's Healthy Returns virtual conference on Tuesday, Gottlieb expressed that \"sleepaway camps have the potential to create a protective bubble that is easier to do than at day camps.\" That's because at day camps the campers and staff are constantly coming and going, which could increase the risk of exposure to the infectious disease.\n\nBut Helene Drobenare, a social worker and the executive director of Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camps in New York, said it's a misnomer that any camp can provide a bubble against Covid-19. \"A bubble is to assume that when you close the gate, that means you can't get mail, you can't get a milk delivery, you can't send anybody in or out to get any kind of food or supplies, and it means you won't have any day workers,\" she said. \"We probably could do a bubble for a very short time period, maybe a few days. I think a bubble is what we want to believe and it's what our hearts want and that's what we want for our children \u2014 a place that will be 100% safe and the disease won't find them there. But in my opinion, I don't think overnight camp can give that coverage. Nowhere in the world today could give that coverage. If it could, we wouldn't be where we are.\" Camp Young Judaea has two day camps \u2014 one in Brooklyn and one in Croton-on-Hudson \u2014 as well as an overnight camp in the Hudson Valley. Collectively, about 750 campers attend the camps, which are considered to be in the coronavirus epicenter.\n\nHelene Drobenare, surrounded by campers at Young Judaea Sprout Camp in 2019 Camp Young Judaea Sprout Camp\n\nJay Jacobs, executive director of Timber Lake Camps, told CNBC's John Fortt on \"Squawk Alley\" last week that he is hopeful his camps will run as planned this summer, claiming that there are ways to ensure a protected environment, especially in sleepaway, or residential, camps. TLC Camps is comprised of seven camps located in Long Island, the Catskill region of New York and northeastern Pennsylvania. His camps serve about 3,000 children. \"You can test your staff before they come to camp. You can test your campers before they come to camp and only accept those with negative tests, so you've already locked out Covid-19, at least initially,\" he said. \"Remember, many resident camps are in rural communities where the prevalence of the virus is not as great as down in the cities or suburbs.\"\n\nQuarantine's effect on kids' mental health\n\nSome mental health experts believe that the harmful effect of kids in indefinite quarantine outweigh the risk of coronavirus exposure at camp. \"The need for connection is as fundamental a need as our need for food, oxygen and shelter, says humanistic psychologist Dr. Scott Barry Kaufman, author of \"Transcend: The New Science of Self-Actualization.\" \"Of course, we must make sure that all children are protected from exposure to the coronavirus, but this protection shouldn't come at the expense of opportunities for shared play, connection and friendship. The right balance of our needs is necessary to become a fully functioning human being.\"\n\nSwimmers at Young Judaea Sprout Camp enjoying the pool last season\n\nBut Denise Daniels, a pediatric oncology nurse and child development expert, says that while she has empathy for the kids hoping to attend summer camp, she has trepidation about them sleeping in bunk beds, sharing showers, making crafts and having meals together on those long wooden tables in the food pavilion. \"I understand what a critical time this is for the mental health and well-being of families after being on lockdown, adhering to social distancing and upholding the endless health rituals of washing hands, coughing and sneezing in elbows, wearing masks and staying six feet apart,\" she says. \"Lots of kids will be attending virtual summer camps this year, and unbelievably, there are tons of fun activities kids can do outside on Zoom or Skype.\" Camp Young Judaea's Drobenare agrees. \"For the first time, they are creating relationships through a screen and not through touch or eye contact, but I believe that we have to deal the cards that are in front of us right now,\" she said. \"If you are asking me to choose between a disease that I'm not sure if it will cause death, or to help these kids somehow build relationships and find hope through a screen, then I think we have to do that and be as creative as we can until we can get through this. It's not the optimal situation, but I think life outweighs anything else in this type of risk.\"\n\nThe American Camp Association, a community of camp professionals that has been in existence for over 100 years, is weighing the guidance from the CDC, along with rules and guidance from the state boards of health and other experts, to help individual camps make the decision as to whether they think they should operate camp this summer and if they could do so subject to the CDC's and state's rules. The ACA's mission is to ensure the quality of its 3,100 member camps across the U.S., which serves more than 10 million of the 20 million children who attend camps every summer across America. \"There's two words in social distance,\" ACA CEO Tom Rosenberg told CNBC's Scott Wapner on \"The Path Forward\" last week. \"First, as parents, we had to help our kids learn to distance themselves from their friends, and now as parents we are watching our kids starve themselves socially and emotionally from their own identity.\" Rosenberg is a leading voice for young people today, advancing the public's understanding of the value of camp for everyone as an essential developmental and educational experience.\n\nHeading off to Camp Virtual\n\nWhile the ACA CEO said he is hopeful camps will be open this summer \u2014 not only for the survival of the camp industry but also so kids can begin to reconnect \u2014 he understands there is a very real possibility that camp may look very different in 2020. \"I expect to see all kinds of summer experiences. Like a continuum of camp. So this summer, camp will look different. It may even be virtual for some. But those connections are going to happen, and children will have joyful experiences that help them learn and grow with each other,\" said Rosenberg. \"Before the pandemic even began, Gen Z kids really had skyrocketing depression and anxiety. And then comes Covid 19. ... We are trying to create connections to help them reconnect with each other, to reconnect with adults and to themselves.\"\n\nAmerican Camp Association CEO Tom Rosenberg says camp may be very different this year, and even virtual for some. Alina Solovyova-Vincent | E+ | Getty Images\n\nAs soon as shelter-in-place orders went into effect in the New York area, Drobenare says she closed Camp Young Judaea and in under two weeks pivoted to create Sprout@Home, a menu of activities including book clubs, yoga classes and online bunk meetups with a counselor. \"We may not be able to be together physically today, but we could be together emotionally and spiritually still,\" said Drobenare, who added that a final decision will be made by the end of the month as to whether or not they will run the camps this summer.\n\nCoronavirus-related cases in youth\n\nHeadlines swirling the last several weeks about coronavirus-related cases rising among youth is also top of mind for parents and camp directors. To date at least 110 cases have been reported in New York, and three young people \u2014 ages 5, 7 and 18 \u2014 have died. Doctors believe the illness \u2014 which the CDC now calls multisystem inflammatory syndrome in children, or MIS-C \u2014 has been reported in at least 19 states and Washington, D.C. It was previously referred to as pediatric multisystem inflammatory syndrome.\n\nThe condition appears to be a post-viral syndrome caused by a delayed immune system response to the coronavirus that can lead to blood vessel inflammation. The inflammatory disease is similar to Kawasaki disease, an illness most common in young children that causes high fever and swelling in blood vessels. Children may also develop a rash and experience abdominal pain and vomiting. Most of the kids who have developed the condition are between 5 and 9 years old and have either tested positive for coronavirus or were found to have antibodies, suggesting that they'd previously been infected.\n\nA hopeful decline in late summer\n\nGottlieb is more optimistic about easing lockdown guidelines in late summer months. When the former FDA commissioner was asked by CNBC's Tyler Mathisen at the virtual conference if he would let his children swim at a public swimming pool or swim club this summer, he did not commit to an answer but said, \"Hopefully there's going to be a seasonal effect here and we are going to see cases decline in July or August and we can all take a little breather in the summer.\" Nevertheless, he is still very concerned about the fall as the virus settles into a more \"seasonal pattern.\" \"If you want to be optimistic, last week we had an average of around 27,000 new cases a day and 1,700 deaths. That's down from about 30,000 cases and 2,000 deaths. But it's still too early to tell.\" To date the U.S. has nearly 1.46 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 and at least 87,603 deaths, according to data from Johns Hopkins University.

Top Democrats on the commitee said they suspected Amazon of lying to Congress over its private label strategy, after a recent Wall Street Journal report on the company's use of third-party seller data appeared to contradict an Amazon executive's previous testimony on its treatment of sellers.\n\nThe committee also threatened to subpoena Bezos if he didn't comply.\n\nIn a response to the committee on Friday, Amazon's vice president of public policy, Brian Huseman, said the company appreciates the opportunity to \"address the issues\" raised in the committee's letter. But Amazon's response doesn't state it will make Bezos available for testimony.\n\n\"We disagree strongly with any suggestion that we have attempted to mislead the Committee or not been cooperative with the investigation,\" Huseman said. \"While our teams remain heads down around the clock focused on protecting the health and safety of our employees while continuing to serve customers during the global pandemic, we remain prepared to make the appropriate Amazon executive available to the Committee to address these important issues.\"\n\nWhen asked whether Amazon will send Bezos to testify, an Amazon spokesperson referred back to Huseman's letter.\n\nBezos is the only CEO of the big four tech firms \u2014 Amazon, Apple, Google and Facebook \u2014 who has never before testified in front of Congress.

Amazon also faces a probe by the Federal Trade Commission, according to Bloomberg.\n\nThe Journal investigation found Amazon employees used nonaggregated or easily identifiable data from third-party sellers to figure out which products to make on its own. The report was based on interviews with more than 20 former Amazon employees and documents reviewed by the Journal.\n\nThe report appeared to contradict testimony by Amazon's associate general counsel Nate Sutton at a July hearing, during which he denied that individual seller data is used to manipulate search algorithms to favor Amazon's own products, or in any other way to directly compete with merchants.\n\nAmazon said it has been \"working with the committee in good faith\" for almost a year to provide information on its seller practices, as well as to answer the committee's questions about the report from the Journal.

Wells Fargo senior banking analyst Mike Mayo said on \"Closing Bell\" that the industry would face near-term struggles but that the major banks were still in solid shape.\"It's earnings hell. It's going to remain earnings hell maybe for the next quarter or two or for much of the rest of year.

The Dow was just 8 points higher after falling more than 260 points to start the day. The 30-stock average also traded up about 100 points at one point. The S&P 500 was up 0.1% while the Nasdaq Composite advanced 0.4%. Both the S&P 500 and Nasdaq dropped more than 1% earlier in the day.

Thankfully, we did not get that,\" he told CNBC during a phone interview. Frederick pointed out the S&P 500 is up just slightly over the past month, following the coronavirus-induced sell-off and subsequent rebound. Sideways trading \"keeps the market from getting overheated.

Penney \u2014 The retailer's stock rocketed 17% on Friday after the company said it had made an interest payment of about $17 million that was due and payable on May 7. The payment by J.C. Penney likely came as good news to investors and part of its ongoing talks with its lenders.\n\nMicron, Intel, Broadcom \u2014 Chip stocks fell following news that the Commerce Department announced that it was restricting the sale of semiconductors to Chinese telecom giant Huawei.

The fund last traded up 0.9% after dropping about 1.5% earlier in the session. The turnaround was led by strong gains in Office Depot and Dillard's which both rose more than 10%. \u2013Li\n\n10:15 am: Dow erases opening losses, turns positive\n\nLess than an hour into Friday's trading, the Dow Jones Industrial Average erased a 270-point loss and climbed into positive territory. -Li\n\n10:08 am: Consumer sentiment for early May comes in higher than expectations\n\nThe early May read on consumer sentiment in the U.S. came in at 73.7, up from 71.8 in April, according to preliminary data released Friday by the University of Michigan. Economists polled by Dow Jones expected U.S. consumer sentiment to drop to 65 in May. \u2013Li\n\n9:56 am: New York manufacturing slumps but beats estimates\n\nBusiness activity continues to contract in New York, though not as bad as economists had feared. The New York Fed's Empire State Manufacturing Survey saw a reading of -48.5%, which signified a sharp contraction but not as bad as Dow Jones estimates of -60. The index measures companies reporting expansion against those seeing contraction, which in the May survey was 14.5% vs. 63.% respectively. Both new orders (-42.4%) and shipments (-39%) showed a continuing downturn but were significantly better than the April gauges. Notably, the employment reading was -6.1%, as 14.7% of employers reported increasing staff while 20.8% said they are seeing decreases. That net measure, though, was far better than the -55.3% reported in April. \u2013 Cox\n\n9:50 am: Cramer on signs of US-China trade escalation: 'Are we crazy?'\n\nCNBC's Jim Cramer said Friday that now is not the time for the U.S. and China to escalate trade tensions as the world already faces unprecedented economic calamity from the coronavirus pandemic. \"What are we crazy?\" Cramer asked, adding the prospect of retaliation from China is \"scary.\" The \"Mad Money\" host's comments come after the Trump administration's move to block semiconductor shipments to Huawei. \u2013Li, Belvedere\n\n9:36 am: Retail store sales by category, clothing stores took biggest hit\n\nAll but one of 13 major retail categories experienced declines in sales in April. Clothing stores took the biggest hit with a 78.8% drop, while electronics and appliance stores saw a 60.6% decline. Non-store sales, which includes online sellers, is the only category with gains. \u2013Li\n\n9:30 am: Stocks open lower, Dow down 200 points\n\nMajor U.S. equity averages traded lower at the open as a record drop in retail sales dented sentiment as signs of increased trade tensions with China added to investors' anxiety. The Dow Jones Industrial Average fell about 200 points, while the S&P 500 dipped 0.9%. The Nasdaq Composite declined 1.1% at the open. \u2014 Li\n\n8:30 am: Retail sales plunge a record 16.4% in April\n\nConsumer spending sank by a record 16.4% in April as a main component of the U.S. economy contracted amid the Covid-19 outbreak, according to a government report Friday. Economists surveyed by Dow Jones expected the advanced retail sales number to fall 12.3%. Some 68% of the U.S.'s $21.5 trillion economy is derived from personal consumption expenditures, which tumbled 7.6% in the first quarter as social distancing measures began to take effect. \u2014 Cox, Franck\n\n8:10 am: Barclays raises oil target\n\nBarclays raised its target on West Texas Intermediate and Brent on Friday, saying that while prices will likely remain volatile in the short term as the market re-balances, the worst is now over. \"Market forces have aligned producers around the world to support fundamentals and demand is increasingly showing signs of having troughed,\" the firm said. Barclays sees WTI and Brent averaging $33 and $37 this year, respectively, before rebounding to $50 and $53 in 2021. WTI traded around $28.23 per barrel on Friday, with Brent at $31.70. \u2014 Stevens\n\n8 am: China insider says the country could activate 'unreliable entity list' to retaliate\n\nHu Xijin, editor-in-chief of Chinese state-run publication Global Times, said in a tweet Friday that if the U.S. takes further action to block supply to Huawei, China will activate the \"unreliable entity list\", \"restrict or investigate\" U.S. companies including Qualcomm, Cisco and Apple, and suspend the purchase of Boeing airplanes. His comment came after the White House moved to prevent shipments of semiconductors to the Chinese telecom giant as tensions between the two nations flared up again amid the coronavirus pandemic. The companies Hu mentioned came under pressure in premarket trading Friday with shares of Qualcomm and Cisco dropping 5.3% and 2.3%, respectively. Apple also fell 2.4% in premarket, while Boeing dipping 3.5%. Hu's Twitter account was closely followed by many Wall Street traders for insight on the trade war last year. His commentary appeared to have inside knowledge about the U.S.-China trade relationship and has sometimes been market-moving. The Global Times is a tabloid under the People's Daily which is the official newspaper of the Communist Party of China. \u2014 Li\n\n7:55 am: Consumer purchases probably hit a new record low in April\n\nRetail sales are expected to hit new depths in April as wary consumers stayed home and bought mainly essentials online. The advance reading, to be released Friday at 8:30 a.m. ET, is expected to show a plunge of 12.3%, according to economists surveyed by Dow Jones. That comes a month after a record 8.7% drop for data that goes back to 1992. The previous low was a 3.8% decline in November 2008 during the financial crisis. Consumers account for about 68% of all U.S. economic activity, so the retail figures are critical. \u2014 Cox\n\n7:50 am: Chip stocks fall amid Huawei worries\n\nSemiconductor stocks fell in premarket trading after the Commerce Department said it would move to block the sale of chips to Chinese telecom giant Huawei. Shares of Micron were trading 3.4% lower, while Nvidia fell roughly 2%. Broadcom and Intel both slipped 1.8%. \u2014 Pound\n\n7:43 am: White House moves to block chips to China's Huawei\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday took action to prevent shipments of semiconductors to China's telecom giant Huawei Technologies. The Commerce Department said it was changing an export rule to \"strategically target Huawei's acquisition of semiconductors that are the direct product of certain U.S. software and technology.\" The company has for months been in the crosshairs of a broader U.S.-China trade battle and the latest announcement is likely to take a toll on the globe's second-largest smartphone maker. \u2014 Franck\n\n7:30 am: Stock futures point to Friday losses", "author": ["Thomas Franck Yun Li Jesse Pound", "Thomas Franck", "Yun Li", "Jesse Pound"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/when-will-we-get-haircuts-again.html", "published": "2020-05-15T22:43:29", "title": "When will we get haircuts again? Beauty experts weigh in on the future of self care", "text": "Rachel Ford Hutman is embracing a more natural style a few months into the pandemic Source: Rachel Ford Hutman\n\nRachel Ford Hutman, a California blonde for years, is now embracing a more natural look. After shelter-in-place was declared in San Diego to stem the spread of Covid-19, she tried to use a coloring spray to cover her roots but it was an unmitigated disaster. Now, she's liking the lived-in ombr\u00e9 look with natural-colored roots, which she hopes will save her money and frequent trips to a hair salon. \"With the last financial crisis, the first thing I cut was Starbucks,\" said Ford Hutman, who works in public relations. \"I'm thinking that any way to save now is a good thing.\" Across the U.S., people are taking creative approaches to their beauty regimens. Couples are watching YouTube videos before cutting each other's hair. Kids are trimming their parents' bangs so they don't cover their faces on Zoom videos. And a so-called \"black market\" for beauty has emerged in some states that are still hunkering down. Beauty workers, many of whom are still unemployed, are doing their best to adapt. Many say they are fielding messages from their former clients about how to manage their hair on their own, and are sending self-care packages in the mail. San Francisco-based stylist Tylor Johnson is taking advantage of the time at home to work on a new product line for blondes, as well as a blog with tips and tricks for hair maintenance. She's also taking online education classes that will help her with her new business. San Diego's Betsy Smith is providing beauty advice through Instagram and YouTube. Some of her clients, like Ford Hutman, are purchasing gift cards for future use, and Smith will donate some of the proceeds to a local charity. She's making ends meet by saving as best she can, and she feels fortunate that she still has some money coming in from a cosmetology school where she worked as an instructor (the school is shut down, but continues to pay her in the short-term). She feels fortunate, as some of her colleagues in the industry are struggling far more than she is. Many stylists, she says, are financially strapped but are nervous about going back to work once their state reopens as there's a lot of fear that they could be exposed to the virus. \"Half are ready to go back to work and the other half are very cautious,\" she said.\n\n\n\nHair stylist Betsy Smith at home Source: Zach J Smith\n\nHow salons will change\n\nJohnson, who works at the Culture of Hair salon in San Francisco's Financial District, specializes in coloring for blondes. She is just one of thousands in the beauty industry who are unable to work until the state starts to reopen. Even once that happens, Johnson expects that she'll take on a reduced client load to maintain social distancing. She expects that many salons will avoid blowouts altogether, or styles that involve super close contact, to reduce the risk of transmission. Clients will also likely sit more than six feet apart in the waiting rooms, and there might not be magazines to sift through. Large salons like Supercuts say they have consulted with public health professionals, and are now requiring their stylists to wear CDC-recommended face masks during their entire shift. They are also expected to wash their hands frequently and sanitize anything that touches a client, including the gowns. In some states where salons are already starting to reopen, including Alabama, Georgia and Louisiana, these precautions and more are in place. In other states, such as California, New York and Michigan, personal care services providers are still awaiting instructions on when they can reopen for business. Once they do, customers might expect longer wait times, as salons will have to take in clients at much lower volumes. Salons might also try to raise prices to recoup some of their lost revenues.\n\nThe rise of self grooming\n\nSelf-administering a haircut is no easy feat, and social media is filled with horror stories. But some say they've had success turning to instructional videos for guidance. YouTube is now filled with videos featuring beauty experts talking through how to embrace roots, cut bangs or to trim split ends with a steady hand. Some are even coloring their significant others' hair in the sink, or taking turns giving each other haircuts. Kids are also proving to be uniquely gifted helpers, and some parents say it's a great way to bond. Venture investor Lisa Suennen said her 24-year-old daughter Maddy helped her dye her roots after her hairdresser mixed her color and delivered a DIY package. \"We laughed like crazy during the process, which was the best part,\" she said. Buzzcuts and shaves are also seeing a resurgence. After a few months at home, Brooklyn-based health-tech entrepreneur Nikhil Krishnan decided it was the right moment to give himself a mohawk. \"I needed to shave because my hair was getting really long,\" he told me. Once he got started, he thought it would fun to document the experience with his friends. That quickly escalated, as he figured his parents might get a kick out of his edgy new style (they \"cracked up,\" he said). \"I had always want to change my hair up into something, and this seemed like the best time to try something new.\"\n\nNew styles\n\nSmith, the stylist in San Diego, is preparing for a resurgence of styles that \"free women from their highlights,\" alleviating the need for frequent root touch-ups. One of her favorite looks is \"grombre\" or \"grey ombr\u00e9,\" where women grow out their natural silver but leave in their lighter ends. Johnson, who's in San Francisco, also expects to see a resurgence of styles like the dip dye ombr\u00e9 look, which involves blending color into the ends with no harsh lines. It's no coincidence, she says, that ombr\u00e9 came into fashion with the great recession of the late 2000s. When consumers are feeling money-conscious and concerned about their financial prospects, they'll often opt for styles that require less upkeep. \"I think a lot of people after this will be happy with how healthy their hair feels,\" said Johnson, noting that many of her clients haven't had a touch up in three to four months. \"So it'll bring back a natural looking hair color.\"\n\nA tough year ahead for salons\n\nHair stylist Tyler Johnson Source: Samantha Lapidus", "author": ["Christina Farr"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/weekend-reads.html", "published": "2020-05-16T14:35:18", "title": "Health officials issue dire warnings; FBI scrutinizes senators' stock sales: This week's recap and best reads", "text": "Jackie Guarneri of Hudson enjoyed beers with friends at Jonesy's Local Bar on the first day of the bar reopening in Hudson.

That evening, the Wisconsin Supreme Court brushed aside health officials concerns and overturned the state's stay-at-home order as unlawful, ruling in favor of a lawsuit filed by the Republican lawmakers. Hours later, crowds were drinking at bars without face masks.\n\nOusted federal vaccine scientist Dr. Rick Bright used more even dire language than Fauci when he warned Congress that the coronavirus pandemic could prove more devastating than the 1918 flu, which killed at least 50 million people globally, and said the U.S. risked \"the darkest winter in modern history\" if the nation's leaders didn't mount a better response.\n\nTesla also reopened its car plant in Fremont in defiance health orders by local authorities and faced a police inspection.

Economists were expecting closer to a 12% decline.\n\nThe figure put into focus the virus' ongoing impact on U.S. economic data, market analysts said following the report.\n\nHere's what three of them, including CNBC's Jim Cramer, are watching now:\n\nJan Kniffen, CEO of J Rogers Kniffen WWE, said the pandemic has simply accelerated trends that were already changing the face of retail:\n\n\"The point is it was really bad, we knew it would be bad, and we know what wasn't selling. What wasn't selling was all of those stores that were closed because the government said, 'You have to be closed,' and people didn't want to really go to them anyway \u2026 and they didn't really want to go to restaurants even if the restaurants had been open. What we've just seen, though, is the worst month. It's going to be better in May because everything's starting to reopen in some parts of the country. The numbers will get better. Most of those stores are opening at about 55% of what they would've done the same time last year. So, that's a real number. And that tells you just how tough it is that you can't get them back in the store yet. That number will gradually rise and will be at 70%, 65% before we get to holiday, and then, if we're lucky, we'll be in the 90% range by the time we get into the holiday selling season. So, ... this number we just saw was terrible, but nobody thought it could be anything but terrible. However, we do know that pajama sales were up 150%. What does that tell you? \u2026 We've had a lot of retailers already file [for bankruptcy], and we're going to have thousands and thousands of stores that only reopen long enough to go out of business. So, that was already happening. We knew there was going to be shakeout in this industry. This started way back when. Gee, [in] 2014 I was on your show saying we're going to see 50% of non-bar, non-retail sales online by 2030. Now, it's going to be by 2025. I was saying we'll see 10,000 stores a year close for the next 10 years. Now, we're going to see 50,000 stores close this year. It's all just being accelerated by Covid. But there's no surprising things going on here. The retailers that were struggling are continuing to struggle, and they're just struggling harder now because cash flow went to zero for a lot of them. That's never happened before in the history of retailing. If you were down 10% in a recession, it was a big deal. Now it's gone to zero for some long period of time \u2013 six weeks, eight weeks, whatever \u2013 and even when you come back, your cash flow's going to 50, 60% of what it normally was. You can't make a living there, so, you continue to see people fail even once we start to put the stores back together. This is just an acceleration of the trend. We're going to go online; We already knew that. We're going to go digital; We already knew that. We're going to go to cashless payments; We already knew that. It's just going to come a lot faster since Covid is pushing that so hard with the consumer because now the consumer also doesn't feel safe. They don't just want convenience now, they want convenience and safety, and that's harder to deliver and it's expensive to deliver. So, the cost structure's also going to get worse for all these retailers as they have to do all of these things to make the consumer feel more comfortable.\"\n\nCramer, the host of \"Mad Money,\" said the government's distinction between essential and nonessential businesses has unfairly weighed on some consumer-facing companies:\n\n\"What can I say? There is just a really horrible distinction between essential and nonessential. \u2026 We were talking with Planet Fitness last night. When they made liquor essential and gyms nonessential, it wiped out a lot of gyms. And so what's going to happen is there'll only [be] one strong gym. All these numbers just point to the same stocks doing well: Costco, Home Depot and Lowe's, recommended this morning, obviously Amazon and, yes, Walmart. Target's doing well. But everybody else is doing poorly. There was an amazing article today about how FedEx is cutting back hours of the ones that are most hurt. \u2026 There's only going to be a couple places for us to go.\"\n\nJeff Saut, chief investment strategist at Capital Wealth Planning, said this downturn may not end up being \"that big a deal.\"\n\n\"I do think there's huge, pent-up demand out there. I mean, we haven't been able to go out to restaurants for five or six weeks. \u2026 I said on CNBC and I've written in my letter the past two weeks that the market's in for a rough spot right here. My models don't tell me how low it's going to go, but, again, I don't think the lows that we made a couple months ago are going to be retested because I think you're going to get a pretty strong pickup in earnings in the back half of this year and I think you're going to get a pretty strong pickup in economic activity in the back half of this year. And there's a ton of cash on the sidelines, and if you talk to the retail investors, they're still scared to death. And that's not the way market blow-off highs are made. So, I think we're still in a secular bull market. Secular bull markets last 15 to 20 years. I think we've got five to 10 years left in this one, and very few people believe that.\"\n\nDisclaimer", "author": ["Lizzy Gurdus"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/china-asks-united-states-to-stop-unreasonable-suppression-of-huawei.html", "published": "2020-05-16T10:20:07", "title": "China asks United States to stop 'unreasonable suppression' of Huawei", "text": "A logo is pictured on a Huawei NetEngine 8000 Intelligent Metro Router during a 5G event in London, on February 20, 2020.\n\nChina's foreign ministry said on Saturday the United States needed to stop the \"unreasonable suppression\" of Chinese companies like Huawei.\n\nThe Trump administration on Friday moved to block global chip supplies to blacklisted telecoms equipment giant Huawei Technologies, spurring fears of Chinese retaliation and hammering shares of U.S. producers of chipmaking equipment.\n\nChina will firmly defend its companies' legal rights, the foreign ministry said in a statement in response to Reuters' questions on whether Beijing would take retaliatory measures against the United States.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/16/saudi-sovereign-fund-discloses-stakes-in-citi-boeing-facebook.html", "published": "2020-05-16T09:29:31", "title": "Saudi sovereign fund discloses stakes in Citi, Boeing, Facebook", "text": "The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington, D.C.\n\nSaudi Arabia's sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund (PIF), has purchased minority stakes in major U.S. companies including Boeing, Facebook and Citigroup, according to a U.S. regulatory filing.\n\nPIF disclosed a $713.7 million stake in Boeing, around $522 million in Citigroup, a $522 million stake in Facebook, a $495.8 million stake in Disney and a $487.6 million stake in Bank of America, the Securities and Exchange filing on Friday showed.

Covid-19 Cases Still On Rise!\" at the entrance of the Atlanta Beltline near Piedmont Park as the coronavirus pandemic continues on May 11, 2020 in Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nCertainty is always more abundant than accuracy on Wall Street. Well argued, data laden hypotheses support opinions that drive buyers and sellers.\n\nA high-profile money manager and fellow talking head, Mr. I. M. Sureofmyself, was describing his view of how the economic and health care crisis would develop and unfold over the next six to 12 months. He offered an articulate, rational, clear vision of the path ahead.\n\nHe argued that cash and bonds are unattractive asset classes in today's environment. He says that in response to Covid-19, the Federal Reserve and federal government have so dramatically suppressed interest rates and ballooned the money supply that inflation will soon return with a vengeance. When that happens, he says, investors will be better off owning growth stocks, for instance, that can at least somewhat protect against the expected surge in inflation.\n\nIt sounds an awful lot like he is advocating that we pile into the very same stocks that massively outperformed 1) throughout the longest bull market in history from March 2009, through early this year; 2) during this year's Covid-19 sell-off (S&P 500 fell 34% from peak to trough); and 3) during the rebound from that sell-off (+26% from the low).\n\nTo me, he doesn't really sound like he is advocating a strategy of \"buy low.\" And in stark contrast to another legend by the name of Warren Buffett, whose company is currently carrying well in excess of $100 billion in cash on its balance sheet, I.M. seems to be largely ignoring the significant risks associated with this severe recession as well as the lofty valuations associated with said \"growth stocks.\"\n\nNow, you may have also heard other professional money managers talk about the risk of a deflationary spiral. They may have said that notwithstanding the massive job losses and business shutdowns, Covid-19 is likely to have a far bigger impact on aggregate demand than aggregate supply. In other words, the economy will be running at significant excess capacity (i.e., the economy is producing more than it can sell). And as we all know from Econ 101, if demand falls faster than supply then prices will not rise, as Mr. Sureofmyself suggests, they will fall.\n\nThat great minds can so disagree is unsettling. Who is right? Either of these outcomes seems plausible. And it's possible we could have deflationary pressures in the near- to intermediate term, followed by inflationary pressures thereafter. The point is that the path of our economic evolution is not preordained and is difficult to predict with much precision. As such, it is tempting but perilous to embrace a path with such conviction at a time when the future is inherently unknowable. Economists John Kay and Mervyn King describe this in their eponymous new book, \"Radical Uncertainty.\" Author Brene Brown suggests that vulnerability is an uncomfortable, unwelcome constant and should be recognized and incorporated into healthy psyches.\n\n\n\nHonest investors need to invest for a future that may have any number of outcomes. Investing weighs risk and reward and is a constantly evolving process. Designing portfolios for a prescribed path is straightforward; for example if interest rates are headed higher, sell dividend payers and bonds. If they are headed lower, buy them. But designing portfolios for any number of inherently unknowable outcomes is not straightforward. It requires a flexible process that can change based on changes in the investment backdrop. By definition, it will almost certainly be imperfect (unless you get crazy lucky). My goal as the steward for many families and institutions is an investment allocation that will endure market struggles, enjoy market gains and should produce solid, long-term results.\n\nStrong balance sheets with limited debt, lots of cash, low dependence on the capital markets, good cash flow and the ability to operate and earn are the core of my pandemic portfolio.\n\nBecause investors must also be opportunistic, I also seek stocks that are selling at significant discounts to intrinsic value because of an unfairly perceived vulnerability. Because I'm conservative and risk-averse, the airlines and hospitality sectors, for example, are outside of my comfort zone right now. There are investors that will place wagers on which airlines will survive, and some will have stellar returns. Yet there are others that will lose bitterly as businesses fail to continue as going concerns. We do not venture into the thin branches of risk. Will there come a time when there is more clarity in the airline and hospitality sectors and an investment opportunity arises that meets our criteria? Perhaps, but we are far too early in this crisis to make that sort of determination.\n\nRecognizing and accepting the \"radical uncertainty\" of the unknown is much harder than following a specific prescription or dogma. But it is often the only honest response.\n\nUnderstanding that outcomes are unknowable helps set reasonable expectations and avoids surprised, panicked disappointment. Keep your wits. Have a plan. Know that we are all vulnerable, but history argues that the long-term expansion in the U.S. economy drives stock prices higher. Longer periods mitigate and buffer short-term volatility. Invest with a disciplined, dispassionate plan and have confidence that the republic and U.S. economy will survive and thrive again.\n\nMichael Farr is the founder, president, and CEO of Farr, Miller & Washington Investment Counsel.", "author": ["Michael K.

Google Earth\n\nThe largest public companies that tapped the government's emergency relief fund for small businesses nearly all had ready access to other forms of capital, according to a CNBC analysis of filings. Even amid the upheaval caused by the coronavirus pandemic, these companies raised millions of dollars by selling stock or had idle credit lines they could've used, factors that likely should've prompted them to return loans they got from the federal Paycheck Protection Program. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has warned of \"severe consequences\" for companies that shouldn't have participated in the program. But just hours before a May 14 deadline to return PPP loans with amnesty, most public companies made no mention of giving back the funds, which become grants if used for approved expenses like payroll. Of the $1.32 billion tapped by public companies across 407 loans, only 61 loans making up a combined $411 million are being returned, according to data analytics firm FactSquared.\n\nOne example: Cutera, a California-based maker of devices like laser-powered hair removers, raised more than $26 million last month by selling shares on the open market, according to filings. It had also applied for a PPP loan days before the Treasury Department had explicitly discouraged public companies with access to the capital markets from doing so. Cutera received the money from stock sales on April 21, the very same day that its application for a $7.1 million PPP loan came through. On top of that, the company had $19.5 million in cash and liquid investments as of March 30, and an untouched $25 million credit line from Wells Fargo to fund its operations. Cutera, run in part by San Francisco-based hedge fund manager Daniel Plants, is just one example of dozens of PPP applicants found by CNBC that were large and established enough to have relationships with bankers and sophisticated investors.\n\nAfter the initial $350 billion round of the small business relief fund was quickly disbursed, a backlash grew against companies including Shake Shack and Ruth's Hospitality Group that had tapped the fund despite having other options. Those two companies returned the money, and were eventually followed by other firms with well-known consumer brands like AutoNation. But many public companies have so far escaped scrutiny because they aren't household names. CNBC found 49 companies with a market capitalization of at least $100 million that took PPP loans and hadn't disclosed plans to return the money as of May 12. Of those firms, 13 sold shares this year, and many of the rest had unused credit lines good for tens of millions of dollars in borrowing power, according to filings. Last month, the Small Business Administration issued guidance in response to the public uproar over the loans, saying that it was unlikely that a \"a public company with substantial market value and access to capital markets\" could make a good-faith certification that it needed the PPP funds. The agency gave companies two weeks to return the money if they suspected they may no longer qualify, and later extended the deadline to May 14. On May 13, Treasury issued an updated FAQ saying that PPP loans under $2 million would likely not be examined and that the deadline to return funds was moved yet again to May 18. \"The purpose of this program was not social welfare for big business,\" Mnuchin told CNBC's Andrew Ross Sorkin on April 28, adding that the government would audit PPP loans over $2 million to make sure they were valid. \"The purpose of this program was to help small businesses.\" Many of the companies found by CNBC are in the technology, health tech and pharmaceutical sectors, which are often the types of businesses that need to regularly sell stock to fund operations while developing new products.\n\nOne example is OncoCyte, which develops early detection cancer tests. The California-based company secured a $1.14 million PPP loan through Silicon Valley Bank on April 23. The next day, it filed a prospectus to issue shares, and ultimately raised $10.75 million last month from stock sales. Another is Xeris Pharmaceuticals, a maker of diabetes medication, which reaped $39.9 million from share sales in February. The Chicago-based company got $5.1 million from the PPP on April 22, and later decided to return $900,000 of that, keeping the rest for payroll and other expenses, the firm said. Applied Optoelectronics, a Texas-based maker of fiber-optic networking products, is another company that has ready access to capital markets. The company had $28.8 million in unused borrowing lines and $62.5 million in cash and liquid securities as of March 31, as well as a deal with Raymond James to sell $55 million in shares. Despite its solid financial footing, the firm applied for a $6.2 million PPP loan through Truist Bank, which it got April 17. In a May filing, the company said that despite the latest SBA guidelines, it still believed it met \"all the requirements\" for the program but that the loan could subject it to \"additional scrutiny which could adversely affect our financial condition.\"\n\nSteven Mnuchin, U.S. Treasury secretary, center, walks through the U.S. Capitol in Washington, D.C., U.S., on Sunday, March 22, 2020.

A spike in new accounts at online brokers show that young and inexperienced investors saw the coronavirus downturn as an entry point into the world of investing and not a time to hunker down. \"New investors who sense a generational-buying moment but do not have much background in the equity space,\" Citi chief U.S. equity strategist Tobias Levkovich said in a note to clients. \"We have heard anecdotally about younger individuals with less market experience viewing the March plunge as a unique time to start portfolios and often crowding into the tech arena, purchasing the stocks whose services or products they know and use.\" The major online brokers \u2014 Charles Schwab, TD Ameritrade, Etrade and Robinhood \u2014 saw new accounts grow as much as 170% in the first quarter, when stocks experienced the fastest bear market and the worst first quarter in history. But young people apparently saw it as an opportunity and began buying familiar technology stocks.\n\nIn March, stocks started to rebound led by resilient tech stocks. There were also hopes that slowly reopening the economy and a Covid-19 treatment will create a path to recovery.\n\n'Monumental volumes'\n\nThe major online brokers saw a major jump in new users during the coronavirus sell-off, bolstered by zero commissions and fractional trades. Charles Schwab CEO Walt Bettinger said in an earnings release the broker saw \"monumental volumes\" of trading from the 609,000 new broker accounts added in the first quarter, with over 280,000 in March alone. The quarter included 27 of the 30 highest volume days in Schwab's history.\n\nTD Ameritrade \u2014 which is set to be acquired by Schwab \u2014 said last month that retail clients opened a record 608,000 new funded accounts in the first quarter, with more than two-thirds of those opened in March. The e-broker's new accounts proved to \"skew younger\" over the last quarter,\" TD Ameritrade chief market strategist JJ Kinahan told CNBC. \"Perhaps because they're home or perhaps because of furloughs, they also have time to dedicate to their investments that they didn't necessarily have before,\" Kinahan added. ETrade, which is set to be acquired by Morgan Stanley, saw a gain of 363,000 accounts in the quarter, a company record. \"I think a lot of the innovation around trading commissions has really driven the accessibility of the markets for everyone and clearly that cohort, the younger ones, are seeing it for the first time in the headlines everyday, 'massive market drop,' so the combination of current events, innovation of trading and technology have really driven this whole movement,\" Tim Welsh, founder and CEO of wealth management consulting firm Nexus Strategy, told CNBC.\n\nRobinhood users soar\n\nRobinhood \u2014 millennial favored stock trading app \u2014 saw a mind-blowing 3 million new accounts in the first quarter, despite glitches and crashes on heavy trading volume days. \"The access to trading, there are no barriers to entry anymore, its on your phone, you can buy whatever you want, fractional shares are available so if you can't pony up $1,400 to buy one shares of Google you can still own the FANG stocks,\" Welsh added.\n\nStock positions at the Silicon Valley start-up have nearly tripled since the end of last year. With the major inflow of new market participants, the market chugged higher, led by the companies young people know and love.\n\nNarrow, tech-led rally\n\nAll three major averages have joined the marker comeback, but the technology-heavy Nasdaq Composite is in the green for the year. The technology darlings that have carried the market over much of the last decade \u2014 Facebook, Apple, Microsoft, Amazon, Netflix and Alphabet \u2014 are leading stocks out of the coronavirus trenches. Shares of Netflix are up 36% and Amazon is up 30% this year.\n\nWall Street is skeptical if this rebound is the real start to the next bull market, given its narrowness. Some analysts are confident stocks will retest their lows when the full economic picture is realized. TD Ameritrade investors \"have been doing a pretty good job choosing technology stocks,\" said Kinahan. \"In this last month, Apple was one of the stocks that stood out in terms of millennial clients compared to our overall client base and Apple performed pretty well in that time frame.\" \"You saw Microsoft, some of the banks, Disney, as the big ones in that time frame. These companies that tend to sit on cash, said Kinahan. TD Ameritrade clients also picked some beaten down oil stocks. Investor newbies are also piling into the beaten down airlines and cruise lines, according to Robintracker, which tracks Robinhood account activity but is not affiliated with the company. Market participants have increased positions in American Airlines, Delta Air Lines, United Air lines, Carnival Cruises and Norwegian Cruise lines the most of any stocks in the past month. \"In the height in March of things that were going very poorly, our millennial clients led the way buying Carnival cruise lines and at the time people are like 'oh my God, how can they do that?' Yet, they went and saw the opportunity where many of perhaps our older clients did not necessarily see that opportunity when the stock was trading sub $8,\" Kinahan added. Michael Krause, chief investment officer at Counterpoint Mutual Funds, said this strategy may not be a safe long term bet. \"Traders here are 'buying the dip' in a lot of names with questionable fundamentals now, i.e. airlines, highly volatile stocks, low in recent price momentum, and ones with that have recently (in the last 3 months) had lottery ticket like upside payoffs occur,\" added Krause. \"Robinhood investors are making all the classic mistakes in the short term.

The Los Angeles-based space start-up conducted a series of tests in December using a 3D-printed tank, which the company increasingly pressurized until it burst. \"It's a pretty big deal to show that the materials actually work and the manufacturing process actually works,\" Relativity CEO Tim Ellis told CNBC on Monday. Ellis explained that \"the point is to figure out what pressure the vessel actually holds.\" While the tank was a fifth the size of the one that will be used for Relativity's Terran 1 rocket, it was structurally representative of the pressures and stress that it would undergo during a launch.\n\nRelativity co-founder and CTO Jordan Noone stands next to one of the company's Stargate 3D printers. Relativity\n\nThe burst pressurization tests helped the company verify its ambitious 3D-printing approach to building rockets, as well as the materials it's using. Ellis said the tank burst at about \"10% more than the requirements with the safety factor\" needed for a launch. \"It's definitely sufficient for the whole launch vehicle,\" Ellis said, adding that \"we've got two years to keep making it better.\"\n\nRelativity growing despite coronavirus crisis\n\nRelativity's rocket development is still on track for its first launch in 2021, Ellis noted, despite the coronavirus pandemic that's begun causing delays within the space industry. While the company's rocket engine test program has been \"delayed the most,\" due to NASA's Stennis center largely shutting down, Ellis said that overall Relativity has been able to continue moving forward. That's in large part because of Relativity's unique approach to manufacturing. \"There's just fewer processes and way fewer supply chain steps, because almost everything is made from very limited raw materials, like our whole rocket structure. All of the engine and the other auxiliary structure components are made from just two raw materials, so it's a very simple supply chain,\" Ellis said. Additionally, Ellis said Relativity is \"in a really good cash position\" to weather the crisis, given that it raised $140 million in October. Relativity's investors include Social Capital, Playground Global, Y Combinator, Bond Capital, Jared Leto and Mark Cuban. \"We are not planning any layoffs and are actually accelerating our hiring,\" Ellis said. \"We've actually done well over a dozen either new hires or on boarding people remotely via Zoom during this time.\" His company began telling the majority of its workforce of more than 150 employees to stay home the first week of March. But the company has been able to keep development moving forward, as Ellis said Relativity has had all four its \"Stargate\" printers running during this time. \"We have one person per building operating printers right now,\" Ellis said. Relativity in February secured a new headquarters in Long Beach, California, which Ellis said most of the company will be moved into by the end of July, with \"the whole facility operational by the end of this year.\"\n\nRelativity co-founder and CEO Tim Ellis stands next to a 3D printed part of the company's Terran 1 rocket, with two of the Stargate printers visible in the foreground.

Because they were a 5% holder before the company went public, Pershing Square was able to be a 13G filer even though they were not a passive holder. However, they were required to convert to a 13D filing when they acquired an additional 2% beneficial ownership within a year.

So, with very little capex, the company just collects royalties which leaves it in an excellent position to weather the current COVID crisis. The Burger King brand was a turnaround story that was accomplished by 3G Capital and management. Tim Horton's is in a similar situation right now with flat same store sales, and Popeyes is doing great.\n\nPershing Square increased its position because it thinks the stock is cheap and is one example of throwing the baby out with the bathwater during the COVID crisis.

This seems paradoxical given the economic toll \u2014 to say nothing of the emotional toll \u2014 on millions of people across the country without a job. While some say this is further indication that the stock market has become decoupled from reality, others say there are clear reasons why stocks have rebounded, and can continue to move higher. For one, the jobs data in and of itself is backward-looking. The April figures \u2014 which saw a record 20.5 million Americans lose their job \u2014 is from the height of the crisis. Since then, economies have begun to reopen. There is still a long way to go, of course, but the market is discounting what's going to happen six months from now, when most states will be getting back to business.\n\nStrategists also point out that the losses have been somewhat concentrated in the leisure and hospitality sector, whose underperformance has overshadowed strength in other areas of the market. And with the government and federal reserve providing record stimulus measures, some argue that once businesses do get back up and running, the recovery will be swift.\n\nThe S&P 500, Dow Jones Industrial Average and Nasdaq Composite all opened higher on Friday, with the Dow surging more than 300 points. Since the March 23 low, all three averages have bounced more than 30%.\n\nWorst over?\n\nWhile the debate among health experts about how and when economies should reopen is ongoing, some states have already started easing shelter-in-place measures. A number of states including Florida began phase one reopenings on Monday. California became the latest state to lift some of its precautionary measures, with certain low-risk retailers allowed to open beginning Friday. \"The market knows that the job losses are self-inflicted due to the widespread shutdowns,\" Bleakley Advisory Group chief investment officer Peter Boockvar told CNBC. \"Thus, now that we are beginning the reopening process the market assumes many of these people will hopefully get hired back over the coming months and quarters.\"\n\nAdditionally, 78% of those who lost their job in April said they were furloughed, meaning the unemployment in theory will be temporary. Goldman strategist Jan Hatzius said this is an important distinction to make, given that it suggests the recovery will be swifter. \"If job losses are concentrated in this segment [furlough], it would increase the scope for a more rapid labor market recovery when the economy eventually rebounds (because employees can be recalled to their previous jobs, as in several past recessions),\" he wrote in a note to clients ahead of the report.\n\nPockets of strength?\n\nAt first the market sell-off was broad in nature as the uncertainty surrounding the coronavirus sent the major averages tumbling into a bear market at the fastest pace on record. But since then, the divide between the winners and losers widened. Unsurprisingly stocks most exposed to the coronavirus threat \u2014 including hotels and airlines \u2014 have continued to trade lower. But other names are showing strength. On Thursday the Nasdaq went positive for the year, as names like Netflix and Amazon surged to all-time highs. \"Large companies have fallen much less than smaller companies. It is likely that as a result of this crisis the strong will get stronger ... and so the stock market is reflecting that in its relative valuation,\" Peter Orszag, Financial Advisory CEO at Lazard and former OMB director under Obama, said on CNBC's \"Squawk Box.\"\n\n\"The US consumer has proven to be the economic engine over the last decade, and investors who are buying heavily into this market believe that behavioral changes are unlikely to create a dislocation in demand longer than a couple of quarters,\" added Shannon Saccocia, chief investment officer at Boston Private Wealth. That said, Saccocia said a more cautious tone is warranted, since she believes it's a \"misconception\" that demand for consumer services will return quickly once government edicts lift.\n\nOngoing stimulus?\n\nAs the coronavirus wreaked havoc on markets, governments and central banks around the world stepped in in an effort to prop up prices. In March, President Donald Trump signed into law a record $2 trillion federal stimulus package known as the CARES Act, while the Federal Reserve announced that it would engage in unlimited asset purchases. \"While the collapse in economic activity is historic, so too is the global policy response to cushion the impact and support a recovery as containment measures are relaxed,\" JPMorgan strategist Marko Kolanovic said in a recent note to clients. \"We estimate the impact of Fed easing in both rates and credit more than compensate for the temporary hit to corporate earnings when valuing the US market via discounted earnings,\" he added.\n\nZero rates?\n\nAs part of its stimulus measures, the Federal Reserve in March slashed interest rates to near zero. At the central bank's most recent meeting at the end of April, it pledged to keep rates at historic lows until the economy recovers. This supports economic activity since it makes borrowing money cheaper. \"Interest rates are going to be extremely low -- barely positive -- for a very long period of time, so that does provide some support to equity prices,\" noted Orszag.\n\nLooking forward", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/08/bitcoin-btc-cryptocurrency-prices-rise-as-halving-approaches.html", "published": "2020-05-08T06:45:03", "title": "Cryptocurrency market jumps by over $13 billion driven by bitcoin as major technical event approaches", "text": "Mehmet Ali Ozcan | Anadolu Agency | Getty Images\n\nA rally in bitcoin led the cryptocurrency market higher ahead of a major technical event for the digital coin and as industry participants report an increased interest from institutional investors.

The Dow Jones Industrial Average is up 28.4% since its March low. \"Overall markets have been bullish since the March lows and this is across asset classes, including crypto,\" Vijay Ayyar, head of business development at cryptocurrency exchange Luno, told CNBC. \"Money printing by the Fed and other central banks globally have given a lot of confidence to investors that the economy will be supported no matter what.\" The U.S. Federal Reserve has announced a number of unprecedented measures to help cushion the economic blow from the coronavirus outbreak. Other central banks around the world, including the European Central Bank (ECB), have unveiled their own stimulus packages. Central bank policies are seen as supportive of risk assets like stocks.\n\nThe 'halving'\n\nPart of the rise in bitcoin's price since the March low has been anticipation of a technical event known as \"halving.\" Bitcoin is not issued by a centralized authority like fiat currencies are. That is why it is often called a \"decentralized\" cryptocurrency. Instead it is governed by code and is underpinned by a technology known as blockchain. In the world of bitcoin, so-called miners with specialized high-powered computers compete with each other to solve complex math problems to validate bitcoin transactions. Whoever \"wins\" this race gets rewarded in newly minted bitcoin. This \"mining\" activity happens in blocks, which is essentially a group of transactions joined into one. Currently, these miners receive 12.5 bitcoin per block mined. The rewards are halved every few years to keep a lid on inflation. On May 12, the reward per miner will be cut in half again, to 6.25 new bitcoin. The effect is that the supply of bitcoin coming onto the market is reduced. Previous halving events, which happen every four years, have preceded big price increases in bitcoin.\n\n\"For the past few weeks, we have seen additional players enter the BTC market as prices have trended upward in anticipation of the halving event as bulls saw this as an opportunity to buy BTC ahead of a price pop and what many expect will be significant price appreciation,\" Matthew Dibb, co-founder of Stack, a bitcoin index fund provider, told CNBC. BTC refers to bitcoin's currency code like USD for the U.S. dollar. \"This has undoubtedly continued into this week and may even carry over the weekend as the halving draws closer.\"\n\nInstitutional buying?\n\nDibb said there are other factors at play as well, including more institutional money flowing into bitcoin. Paul Tudor Jones, a high-profile Wall Street hedge fund manager, revealed in a message that one of his funds holds a low single-digit percentage in futures on the cryptocurrency, Bloomberg News reported. \"The news that renowned investor, Paul Tudor Jones, has backed bitcoin\u2014publicly praising the asset for its properties as a store of value has almost certainly helped catalyse BTC's sudden movement into the US$10,000 zone,\" Dibb said. \"With monetary easing policies and 'unlimited' economic stimuli being recently unveiled across the world, fiat currencies seem set to weaken substantially. This has, in turn, led to bitcoin's narrative as a 'store of value' to gain added traction amongst investors who are seeking to hedge against volatility in traditional markets.\" Bitcoin has often been compared to gold as a so-called safe haven asset during turbulent times for other risky assets like stock markets. However, recently, bitcoin has fallen and risen when stock markets have.\n\nFlashbacks to 2017?", "author": ["Arjun Kharpal"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/bubble-stocks-like-beyond-meat-and-peloton-were-supposed-to-blow-up-but-the-opposite-happened.html", "published": "2020-05-08T12:37:07", "title": "'Bubble' stocks like Beyond Meat and Peloton were supposed to blow up, but the opposite happened", "text": "Peloton machine Source: Peloton\n\nMany on Wall Street were convinced the usual playbook would occur when this market and economic downturn hit. Bubble-like tech stocks that led the way up would get crushed as a bear market exposed their hype and sent stock speculators scrambling. But the opposite has happened. The names skeptics used to point their fingers at are actually among the biggest winners this year, and their strength pushed the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite into positive territory on Thursday. High-flyers Amazon and Netflix were the among the first stocks to fully make back the losses from the coronavirus sell-off that triggered the fastest bear market on record. Meanwhile, shares of Beyond Meat and Peloton rebounded violently, and are now up more than 50% each this year. Tesla is up a whopping 86%.\n\nIt turns out society shutting down to curb the spread of the coronavirus is good business for many of these speculative names. Investors flocked to their old loves Netflix and Amazon in the stay-at-home age, while cheering positive news from smaller players like Beyond Meat and Peloton. Beyond Meat reported that sales more than doubled in the first quarter thanks to newfound demand from its partners and retailers looking to bulk up on alternative meats in an age when meatpacking plants are shutting down because of the virus risk. Peloton said it held its largest class ever last week, with more than 23,000 people streaming it from home. The shares surged on Thursday after it said sales were up 66%. That is not to say these stocks didn't suffer from the market's historic rout at first as investors dusted off the old playbook. In fact, Beyond Meat, Tesla and Peloton all fell more severely than the S&P 500 during the rapid plunge. \"Several of these stocks did get hit hard initially,\" said Matthew Maley, chief market strategist at Miller Tabak. \"It was only after the worst was over that people came running back into those names.\" \"Once investors saw that the Fed was going to provide a strong safety net, they came back into the market, but they still wanted to weight their holdings towards those that would actually benefit from the lockdown,\" Maley said.\n\n'Cult of personality'\n\nTesla is a different story. The stock had a massive run earlier this year, driven by analysts upping price targets and short covering by those who bet against Elon Musk's automaker. Many were worried Tesla might be a speculative bubble that sometimes occurs near the end of bull markets. \"Tesla is its own cult of personality,\" said Dan Nathan, principal of RiskReversal Advisors. \"When the history books are written on this period of the stock market, this is going to be a big asterisk.\" Shares of Tesla surged more than 40% in the past month, boosted by strong quarterly results with better-than-expected deliveries even amid the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nGetting crowded again", "author": ["Yun Li"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/07/cargo-carriers-are-reaping-the-rewards-of-the-coronavirus-slowdown-in-air-travel.html", "published": "2020-05-07T22:01:11", "title": "Cargo carriers reap rewards of coronavirus chaos", "text": "A Boeing 747 cargo freighter belonging to the Atlas Air flies into the clouds after lifting off from Hong Kong International Airport, on 23 October 2017, in Hong Kong, Hong Kong.\n\nNot all airlines are reeling from the coronavirus pandemic.

ATSG posted net income of $133.7 million for the first quarter, compared with $22.6 million in the first three months of 2019, according to FactSet. Its stock fell slightly Thursday but is up more than 17% in the second quarter so far.\n\nThe results are a stark contrast to the four biggest U.S. passenger airlines, which last month posted their first quarterly losses in years as U.S. travel demand dropped more than 90%, a result of the virus and measures to keep it at bay, like shelter-in-place orders.\n\nUnited's stock is down by 28% since the end of March, Delta is off 24%, Southwest has fallen 28% and American is down 22%.\n\nThose airlines, however, have quickly moved to operate cargo-only flights facing a dearth of passengers.

Jeena Moon | Reuters\n\nWith one-third of S&P 500 companies declining to provide guidance, picking winners and losers has become a delicate business. How can anyone possibly figure out what's going to happen to earnings when the companies themselves have admitted they don't know? Regardless, one of the defining characteristics of stock investors is that ignorance of the future has never stopped them from making bets \u2014 big bets, in some cases. The last few weeks have seen many unusual flows into exchange-traded funds that offer an insight into what those bets look like. Here are some broader themes:\n\nIs this the bottom?\n\nHow many times have you heard this story? Despite the worst possible outlook, some investors are trying to call bottoms in beaten-up industries like energy and airlines Shares outstanding in the S&P 500 Energy ETF, for example, have increased 45% since the beginning of April. It's even wilder for U.S. Global JETS ETF, a basket of mostly American airlines. Shares outstanding have gone from 1.5 million at the end of March to north of 40 million shares.\n\nThe winners will keep winning\n\nGold diggers\n\nA smaller but equally enthusiastic groupis continuing to pour money into gold ETFs. Call them the doom-and-gloomers: those who believe gold is a haven in uncertain times. Investment demand for gold is way up even as jewelry demand in China and India, the two largest jewelry markets in the world, is down. Shares outstanding in the largest ETF that holds gold directly, SPDR Gold Trust, are at their highest level since 2013, even as gold prices also hit a seven-year high, swelling the value of the fund to over $50 billion. Shares in competitor iShares Gold Trust have also skyrocketed.\n\nInto the US, out of everywhere else\n\nAnother noticeable trend: into America, out of Europe and Asia. There have been outflows in the largest European ETFs, including Vanguard FTSE Europe, SPDR EuroSTOXX 50, iShares MSCI Eurozone and iShares Core MSCI EAFE. The picture in emerging markets is a bit more nuanced, but in general there have been outflows from the larger funds as well, including Vanguard FTSE Emerging Markets and iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF. Todd Rosenbluth, head of ETF and mutual fund research at CFRA, said it was no surprise investors were reducing exposure to areas with significant China influence. \"With expectations that China and other historically fast growing markets experiencing the same pain as the US, investors have chosen to reduce their risk profile,\" he wrote to me.\n\nWhat's it all mean?", "author": ["Bob Pisani"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/15/this-breakdown-of-retail-sales-data-shows-why-amazon-is-leading-the-stock-market.html", "published": "2020-05-15T20:12:19", "title": "This breakdown of retail sales data shows why Amazon is leading the stock market", "text": "\"In typical Internet fashion, a winner-take-most model played out with Amazon now accounting for 40% of US [gross merchandise volume],\" Bernstein analysts said Friday in a note to clients. Benstein pointed to Amazon's large production selection, lower prices, and reliable delivery as factors that will make it a \"clear beneficiary of eCommerce acceleration.\"\n\nOther retailers are also seeing a bounce in online orders, but Amazon's market share, as well as the one-stop-shop nature of the site, means it's often the first choice for consumers.\n\nIncluded in this category, which saw an 8.4% month-over-month increase, is online shopping. With much of the country under shelter-in-place orders during April, consumers increasingly turned towards e-commerce giants like Amazon for their shopping needs.\n\nAs the pandemic took hold in the U.S. in March, shares of the Seattle-based company initially moved lower, but since then the stock has recovered \u2014 and then some. Amazon hit an all-time intraday high of $2,475 on April 30, and shares have gained nearly 30% this year, compared with the S&P 500's 11.7% decline.\n\nIn the first quarter, Amazon said that net sales jumped 26% year over year to $75.5 billion as people flocked to its site. The volume was so high that the company temporarily halted delivery for non-essential items while hiring 175,000 additional workers to keep up with the heightened demand.\n\n\"Amazon loyalists leaned so heavily into this channel that they broke it \u2013 with the company pivoting away from non-essential deliveries and hiring 175K more workers to keep up. Walmart and Target loyalists did the same thing to those retailers' nascent digital channels,\" Bernstein added.\n\nAmazon is not the only retailer seeing a spike in online sales. On April 23 Target said digital sales were up 275% month-to-date, while Best Buy said in an April business update that domestic online sales jumped 250%. Wayfair, Shopify and Overstock.com are among the other online retails that have reported rising sales.\n\nLooking to capitalize on the digital sales surge, Walmart announced on April 30 that it was rolling out its Express Delivery service. The company accelerated the development of the service in an effort to meet growing demand for delivery, while also announcing plans to hire an additional 200,000 people.\n\nWhile all of these companies have seen a jump in sales, their market share of the digital shopping sphere lags Amazon by a significant amount. Amazon makes up roughly 40% of the market while Walmart, the second largest player, occupies around 5% of the market, according to eMarketer.\n\nShares of Walmart are up about 4% for the year while Target has slid 5%. The SPDR S&P Retail ETF (XRT), which tracks the sector, has dropped more than 20%.\n\nAmazon expects the jump in sales during the pandemic to lead to longer-term gains. For the second quarter, the company said it expects net sales to come in between $75 billion and $81 billion, representing year-over-year growth between 18% and 28%.\n\n\"We believe that the long term steepening of Amazon's growth curve driven by the acceleration of consumer adoption of ecommerce and enterprise adoption in cloud computing, enabled by the company's investments in fulfillment and infrastructure, and the associated high returns are likely to drive significant share price outperformance well beyond the current crisis,\" Goldman Sachs analyst Heath Terry said following the company's first quarter results.", "author": ["Pippa Stevens"]}, {"link": "https://www.cnbc.com/2020/05/06/jim-cramer-plant-based-meat-is-a-trend-investors-should-not-ignore.html", "published": "2020-05-06T16:35:17", "title": "Cramer says the plant-based meat 'movement is happening' and investors better 'get on the bus'", "text": "CNBC's Jim Cramer said Wednesday that investors cannot ignore the rising popularity of plant-based meat products.\n\n\"This movement is happening.

This is not blockbuster drug, but watch this trend,\" Cramer said. \"I think it's very exciting for investors.\"\n\nShares of Beyond Meat were up about 17% on Wednesday morning to around $118 each.\n\nBeyond Meat, at a $7.2 billion market value, has been at times one of Wall Street's hottest stocks but also one of the most volatile since its May 2019 initial public offering. Priced at $25 per share, the stock saw a meteoric rise to nearly $240 by last July. But come December, it had lost about 70% of its value. In the early part of this year, the stock rebounded before falling off a cliff, bottoming at about $48 in mid-March. Since then, the stock has more than doubled.\n\nOn Tuesday evening, in addition to strong revenue, Beyond Meat posted quarterly net income of $1.8 million, up from a net loss of more than $6 million last year. It did warn of a hit to its restaurant business due to the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nHowever, the \"Mad Money\" host said he believes the plant-based meat industry may ultimately be beneficiaries of the Covid-19 crisis.\n\nMeatpacking plants across the U.S. have seen significant virus outbreaks, forcing some to slow down production or temporarily close as workers became sick. The developments ignited concerns about the country's food supply, although President Donald Trump signed an executive order last week requiring the plants to remain open during the coronavirus pandemic.\n\n\"I think there are people who are getting appalled by what's happened at the meat packers. ... I think these stories make you become not necessarily vegetarian but to think twice about beef,\" Cramer said. \"If you think twice about beef and then you try to Beyond, you kind of realize it's very, very similar.\"\n\nWhile plant-based meat options have typically been more expensive than traditional meat, Cramer said the rising costs of beef, in particular, due to the coronavirus represents an opportunity for alternative producers.\n\nOne of Beyond Meat's chief rivals in the plant-based meat category, Impossible Foods, is not publicly traded. But it is widely available as well. Grocery store chain Kroger also has launched private-label beef options.\n\nCramer noted that food giant such as Nestle have entered the plant-based burger market.

On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV \u2018actively encouraging\u2019 a return to work.

An R value above 1 means the epidemic will start to grow exponentially again, which would result in a new surge of cases.\n\nIt raises questions about the extent to which restrictions can be safely eased in coming weeks. In his address on Sunday, Boris Johnson said: \u201cWe have the R below 1, between 0.5 and 0.9 \u2013 but potentially only just below 1.\u201d\n\nThe slight increase and narrowing in range is not linked to lockdown relaxations this week as the estimate is based largely on hospital admissions and deaths data, which reflect the levels of transmission two to three weeks ago.\n\nA likely explanation is that while overall levels of infection have fallen, hospital and care home settings are making a relatively bigger contribution to the overall estimate of R. Lockdown restrictions have less impact in these settings and there are still concerns about the levels of testing available in care homes.\n\nThe figure suggests that, while the lockdown has been effective at bringing down case numbers, R is still close to 1, meaning that it would not be possible to ease restrictions significantly without new measures to contain outbreaks, such as extensive testing and tracing.\n\nIt comes as data showed that while London was a hotspot of infection at the start of the epidemic, attention is now shifting to the north of England, where transmission rates of Covid-19 appear to be falling far less steeply.\n\nSome epidemiological models suggest transmission rates in the capital are now half those seen in the north-east and Yorkshire, raising the question of whether all areas will be safe to emerge from lockdown at the same time.\n\nThere is growing unease among civic leaders in the north of England at plans to ease lockdown rules, with one council leader branding it as \u201cfrankly, madness\u201d.\n\nThe leader of Gateshead council, Martin Gannon, said on Friday that the advice to the public to \u201cstay at home\u201d would continue. Gannon, whose views on lockdown were echoed by his counterparts in Newcastle and Sunderland, said there was evidence that the R rate was greater than 1 in his borough.\n\nHow do models calculate the R value?\n\nThe R value tells you how many infections each infected person passes the virus on to, on average. For an R above 1, the epidemic increases exponentially; below 1 it will eventually fizzle out. In the absence of direct measures of this elusive number, modellers have to rely on what firm data we have and extrapolate from there.\n\nSome models, such as one by Public Health England (PHE) and Cambridge University, rely on the numbers of reported deaths, and the steep, steady decline in deaths in London translates into an estimate that community transmission must have also rapidly dropped off.\n\nDeaths are reliable figures, less subject to biases than some other measures, but they reflect the infection rates that were occurring about three weeks previously and so do not give a dynamic reflection of where things are.\n\nPolicy changes around working and socialising introduced in the past week may have influenced R, but a model based on deaths will not give any insights into this. The PHE model projected that there might be as few as 24 new cases in the capital per day on 10 May. This reflects the strong downward trend London has been on, but the model is not designed to give razor-sharp predictions of day-by-day infection statistics. On Thursday, 49 people with new infections were admitted to hospitals in London.\n\nSome models rely on measures such as symptoms reported to phone apps, which have a shorter lag time. However, these data are more \u201cnoisy\u201d and so give a less robust measure of R overall, although they can give better insight into short-range changes.\n\nHow sure are we about regional differences?\n\nAlmost all available data and models suggest there are strong regional differences in terms of the number of infections and current transmission rates. Serology surveys suggest that more than 10% of people in London have been infected with Covid-19, compared with around 4% in the rest of the country. In general, urban centres have had more infections than rural areas.\n\nThe data from hospital admissions and deaths also suggest that R has come down far more steeply in London than in other regions. The PHE and Cambridge model suggests that R in London is 0.4, compared with 0.8 in the north-east and Yorkshire and 0.75 for the country as a whole.\n\nThis is one of a handful of models feeding into advice from the Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage) to government, and all are showing broadly similar patterns across the regions. However, the extent of the differences varies, meaning that an optimistic estimate for London cannot be relied on too heavily.\n\nMatt Keeling, professor of populations and disease at the University of Warwick, described the PHE/Cambridge estimate for London as \u201cextremely low\u201d. His own team\u2019s predictions put the London R value closer to 0.6.\n\n\u201cThis still predicts a faster decline in London than the rest of the country, but not as dramatic \u2026 The difference between 0.4 and 0.6 might sound like scientists arguing over small details, but these translate to very substantial differences in the rate of decline of cases, or the time for the epidemic to halve,\u201d he said.\n\nWhat are the reasons for regional differences?\n\nInitially, London was a few weeks ahead of other regions of the country because far more infections were seeded there at the start of the epidemic. However, it has also seen a steeper decline and, in fact, may have always had a slightly lower community transmission rate than some other geographical regions.\n\nThere are likely to be a wide range of factors behind this. London may now have a higher level of population immunity, which could be playing a role in bringing down transmission, since a higher proportion of people have been infected.\n\n\u201cIf it turns out that there\u2019s loads of immunity in the community, then that\u2019s brilliant, but I don\u2019t think we should plan for that scenario,\u201d said Thomas House, reader in mathematical statistics at the University of Manchester. \u201cWe don\u2019t really know yet.\u201d\n\nThere are also likely to be substantially different contributions from hospitals and care homes, where transmission rates have not been effectively brought under control. In some regions, the spread of infection in these settings, where lockdown does not have the same impact, could be making a major contribution to keeping R close to 1.\n\nDifferences in living arrangements \u2013 for instance, larger family groups living together outside London \u2013 could play a role. Models may also not fully capture the role of underlying health issues and deprivation in raising the risk of severe cases.\n\nIs there evidence that people in some regions have complied less with the lockdown?\n\nThere isn\u2019t strong evidence for this. The lockdown has brought down transmission rates in the community across the country, and a forthcoming study from scientists at Imperial College London does not seem to suggest that London has been an outlier in terms of compliance.\n\n\u201cThe uniformity with which the UK responded to the lockdown is remarkable,\u201d said Steven Riley, professor of infectious disease dynamics. \u201cI thought maybe people in London who were close to a large epidemic would be much more compliant than elsewhere. But the behaviour change was very well synchronised across the UK.\u201d\n\nDo the models suggest restrictions should be eased regionally?\n\nThis is an emerging view among scientists. \u201cBased on just the epidemiology, it makes a tremendous amount of sense,\u201d said House. \u201cThere\u2019s no point locking down if there\u2019s no cases to prevent.\u201d However, he and others acknowledge that the political decision will be weighted by factors beyond simply modelling the trajectory of case numbers.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s much more difficult to message the relaxation than it is to message the lockdown,\u201d said Riley. \u201cI suspect the most difficult aspect on possible regional differences is how you would message it. That uncertainty would be much greater than any mechanistic modelling uncertainty.\u201d", "author": ["Hannah Devlin"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/how-coronavirus-spreads-in-restaurant-video", "published": "2020-05-15T18:22:34", "title": "Dying to go out to eat?

Over the course of a typical dining period, the rest of the guests behave in predictable fashion, selecting utensils from serving stations, enjoying their food, checking their phones and so on.\n\nAt the end of the experiment the backlight is turned on and the substance is revealed to be smeared everywhere: plates, foodstuff, utensils and even all over some of the guests\u2019 faces.\n\nA second experiment in the same environment showed the benefits of improved hygiene techniques.

However, the regional governments of Madrid and Catalonia have been publishing their own figures on people who have died in care homes from the virus, or while exhibiting symptoms consistent with it.\n\nIn Madrid, the total for Covid, or suspected Covid, deaths since 8 March stood at 5,886 on Thursday. In Catalonia, it was 3,375. Between them, care home deaths in the two regions account for more than a third of all the coronavirus deaths in the country.\n\nItaly\n\nDeaths from coronavirus in Italy\u2019s care homes came to light only when newspapers started to report on the issue in early April.\n\nThe prime focus was on a care home in Milan, which had more than 1,000 residents and where there was an unusual increase in deaths in March. An investigation began, and care home officials found that 300 residents had died between January and April.\n\nOf the 900 residents still in the home, 34% were positive for Covid-19. Italy\u2019s higher health institute found that between 1 February and 17 April there had been 6,773 deaths across all care homes, 40% of which were due to Covid-19.\n\nUnited States\n\nOne of the first US coronavirus cases was confirmed by the Centers for Disease Control in Washington state in late January. By late March, the US outbreak was centred around one care home, the Life Care Centre of Kirkland in King County, where more than three-quarters of residents fell ill and 40 people died. Staff who worked multiple jobs unwittingly carried the virus to other care homes in the area.\n\n\n\nFor a variety of reasons \u2013 including the US\u2019s privatised healthcare system, pre-existing problems with infection-control in America\u2019s care homes, a lack of federal leadership on the pandemic and the varying rate of spread of the virus across other states \u2013 lessons from King County have not been learned.\n\nResidents of nursing homes have accounted for a staggering proportion of Covid-19 deaths in the US, where more than 85,000 people have died. Privately compiled data shows that such deaths now account for more than half of all fatalities in 14 states, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. But only 33 states report nursing home-related deaths, so the true extent of the problem across the state remains unknown.\n\n", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/society/2020/may/16/uk-bars-and-hair-salons-get-more-help-than-care-homes-say-providers", "published": "2020-05-16T16:53:34", "title": "UK bars and hair salons get more help than care homes, say providers", "text": "Care services, in residential settings and in the home, face ruin as they miss out on government money offered to other sectors\n\nUK bars and hair salons get more help than care homes, say providers\n\nCare homes are receiving less Covid-19 support from the government than restaurants, hairdressers and shops, according to leading care bodies.\n\nLast week, Friary Lodge in north London became the first care home to be forced to close by the financial impact of coronavirus and many more of the UK\u2019s 18,000 homes are under threat, according to members of the Care Provider Alliance, the umbrella group for care organisations.\n\nHomecare providers whose carers support patients in their own homes also face financial ruin, according to Dr Jane Townson, chief executive of the UK Homecare Association.\n\nThe UKHCA says up to 80% of homecare firms will be at risk of insolvency by the end of July.

Standing behind Trump, Anthony Fauci, an infectious diseases expert, wore a face mask and cast his glance down and reached to adjust his tie as the president spoke. Trump did not wear a face mask.\n\nThe US House of Representatives has narrowly approved a $3tn bill pushed for by Democrats to battle the coronavirus and stimulating a faltering economy. But Republicans who control the Senate have vowed to block the bill, though some support its provisions aimed at helping state and local governments.\n\nTrump also suggested on Saturday his administration might resume some payments to the World Health Organization, which he has frozen after accusing the body of promoting Chinese \u201cdisinformation\u201d.

So far, there have been 1.4 million confirmed cases of Covid-19 in the US, and 88,000 people have died from the virus.\n\nThose crises, as well as the high-profile killings of black people by police, loomed large in the virtual event, itself necessitated by the shutdown of large gatherings to stem the spread of the disease.\n\n\u201cThese aren\u2019t normal times. You\u2019re being asked to find your way in a world in the middle of a devastating pandemic and a terrible recession,\u201d said Obama.\n\nHe added that the injustices faced by African Americans are not new, and described the recent high-profile killing of Ahmaud Arbery, an unarmed black jogger who was shot and killed after being pursued in broad daylight by a white former police officer and his son through a neighborhood in Georgia.\n\n\u201cWe see it when a black man goes for a jog and some folks feel like they can stop and question and shoot him, if he doesn\u2019t submit to their questioning,\u201d said Obama.\n\nHe went on to use the circumstances of the online graduation as a rallying cry for new graduates: \u201cIf the world\u2019s going to get better, it\u2019s going to be up to you.\u201d\n\nAlthough Obama has largely avoided criticizing Trump\u2019s performance in office, in a call leaked last week the former president described the US government\u2019s coronavirus response as, \u201can absolute chaotic disaster,\u201d and questioned whether the justice department\u2019s decision to drop charges against former national security advisor Michael Flynn could endanger the \u201crule of law\u201d in the United States.\n\nThe remarks prompted the US Senate majority leader, Mitch McConnell, to tell the former president to \u201ckeep his mouth shut\u201d. The week also saw the emergence of #Obamagate, which one former CIA analyst described as, \u201ca hashtag in search of a scandal\u201d.\n\nObama\u2019s remarks were preceded by speeches and performances by musicians, actors and entertainers such as Steve Harvey, Anthony Hamilton, Doug E Fresh, Wyclef Jean, Common, Kevin Hart, Wendy Raquel Robinson and Vivica A Fox.\n\nMessages to graduates tuning in online because they could not hold traditional celebrations on campus were shot through with acknowledgements of America\u2019s history of racial segregation.\n\nThis, speakers said, made the universities essential, while noting the perseverance required to spend a final semester largely online, and the bittersweetness of the moment itself.\n\n\u201cThis is obviously not the way you wanted to graduate, we get that,\u201d said Doc Rivers, coach of the NBA\u2019s Los Angeles Clippers, \u201cBut you know what else we know?

It doesn't look like it from the regions | Andy Burnham", "text": "Two weeks ago, I joined the eight other English regional mayors on a phone call with the prime minister. As a former mayor himself, Boris Johnson gets where we\u2019re coming from. Over the best part of an hour, we had a friendly discussion about the release from lockdown and the need for the regions to be empowered to lead recovery within a national framework.\n\nI took the opportunity to repeat a call for a safety-led approach to any release. But I also made a point of saying how important it was for us all to preserve a sense of national unity. We wanted to continue work in that way, but given the complexity of what lay ahead, that would mean being properly involved in what comes next.\n\nWhen I listened to the PM make his announcement last Sunday \u2013 and observing the government\u2019s behaviour this week \u2013 it has felt as though it had decided to do the polar opposite of what I was asking. Life has changed and, suddenly, everything feels very fractious.\n\nIn Greater Manchester, we had no real notice of the measures. On the eve of a new working week, the PM was on TV \u201cactively encouraging\u201d a return to work. Even though that would clearly put more cars on roads and people on trams, no one in government thought it important to tell the cities that would have to cope with that.\n\nFar from a planned, safety-led approach, this looked like another exercise in Cummings chaos theory.\n\nBut it wasn\u2019t just the lack of notice that was the problem. The surprisingly permissive package might well be right for the southeast, given the fall in cases there. But my gut feeling told me it was too soon for the north. Certainly, the abrupt dropping of the clear \u201cstay at home\u201d message felt premature.\n\nSimply telling people to drive doesn\u2019t work for the third of people here who don\u2019t own a car\n\nIf the government had taken us through their reasoning, perhaps we could have been reassured. But this brings me to a recurrent problem throughout the crisis. The mayor of London is on Cobra, and rightly so. But there is no place for any mayors from the north, or indeed the rest, of England.\n\nFor a government elected on votes in the north, and promises to \u201clevel-up\u201d, it is surprising how quickly it has reverted to the default, London-centric mode in this crisis. Last Sunday\u2019s package certainly felt more suited to the south than to the north.\n\nAnd the same pattern continued into the week. On Thursday, a \u00a31.6bn funding package was agreed for Transport for London. I don\u2019t have a problem with that. But where was the deal for Manchester, Liverpool and Birmingham?\n\nLike London\u2019s Tube, our tram system has seen an increase in passengers this week. But we are running a skeleton, 20-minute service and are not even fully funded to do that. If you are encouraging a return to work, surely any safety-led approach would require you to help cities fund extra trams to allow for social distancing? Simply telling people to drive doesn\u2019t work for the third of people here who don\u2019t own a car.\n\nIt\u2019s not just on transport where the government is not reading the room. At the start of the crisis, the message to councils was, \u201cspend what you need to keep people safe, we will see you right\u201d. Now it\u2019s all about \u201csharing the cost\u201d.\n\nIn the same week that the ONS identified the link between the virus and deprivation, the government removed deprivation weighting from the latest council allocations. Nine of the 10 Greater Manchester councils received hefty cuts. The change resulted in a huge shift of resources from north to south, with Knowsley getting a 39% cut and South Gloucestershire a 30% increase. Not so much \u201clevelling-up\u201d as doubling down on the north-south divide.\n\nThis matters because northern councils are seeing more cases and facing extra costs, not least on issues like homelessness. At the start of all this, the government rightly launched an \u201cEveryone In\u201d policy. We needed no persuading and already had a scheme in hand. However, a few weeks on, the goalposts were moved. When we said Everyone In, civil servants explained, we meant people who were homeless before the crisis, not those who have become homeless since.\n\nWe are now left with 800 people in hotels and apartments but with insufficient funding to help them make a transition to a more secure placement. The communities secretary insists he is fully funding \u201cEveryone In\u201d but our councils see it differently. The gap between national government and local government in England is growing wider by the day.\n\nSo where do we go from here?\n\nIf the government carries on in the same vein, expect to see an even greater fracturing of national unity. Different places will adopt their own messaging and policies. Nervousness in the north about the R number will see more councils adopt their own approach on schools, as Liverpool, Gateshead and Hartlepool are doing. Arguments will increase about funding. And if we don\u2019t get the help we need, there is a risk of a second spike here which, in turn, will pass the infection back down the country through the Midlands to London.\n\nInstead, the government needs to draw a line and show it is listening.\n\nTomorrow morning, it should ask the mayor of the West Midlands to represent the non-London mayors on Cobra and commit to publish the regional R number, as requested by myself and the mayor of the Liverpool city region. They should quickly follow that by agreeing a transport funding package for cities to put on more buses and trams so that people can travel more safely to work. And something that would win back huge goodwill across all of England would be a commitment to honouring the promise to cover all costs incurred by councils, including on homelessness.\n\nWe remain in the midst of a national crisis and we need a sense of national unity to get through it. We all need to work hard next week to bring that back.\n\n\u2022 Andy Burnham is mayor of Greater Manchester", "author": ["Andy Burnham"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/men-masks-coronavirus-protests-masculinity-kills", "published": "2020-05-16T14:00:31", "title": "Men are less likely to wear masks \u2013 another sign that toxic masculinity kills | Arwa Mahdawi", "text": "Sign up for the Week in Patriarchy, a newsletter\u200b on feminism and sexism sent every Saturday.\n\nThe fragile face of mask-ulinity\n\nIsaac Newton is widely considered to have had a very productive plague. During two years of social distancing on a farm he came up with important new mathematical insights and started formulating his theory of gravity.\n\nMy own quarantine experience has largely consisted of attempting to complete Netflix. However, last week I decided to channel Newton and conduct some scientific experiments of my own. I stood in my local New York park counting passers-by to see if there were any gender differences in mask-wearing. Please don\u2019t judge me: at least I didn\u2019t spend my spare time starting a podcast.\n\nThe results of my study, A Sociological Park-Based Meta-Analysis of Gendered Mask Habits (due to be published in the Journal of Arwa\u2019s Thoughts) were unequivocal. Men were just as likely to wear masks as women. In face-coverings, at least, we had achieved gender equality!\n\nIt is with a great deal of disappointment, then, that I must announce that my findings have been refuted by a rather more robust study. A new survey of 2,459 people living in the US has found that men are less likely to don face masks because they believe wearing one is \u201cshameful,\u201d \u201ca sign of weakness,\u201d and \u201cnot cool.\u201d\n\nThe survey, conducted by American and British researchers, also found that men are less likely to believe they\u2019ll be significantly impacted by Covid-19 than women. Which is ironic, because there is a huge amount of evidence showing that men are much more likely to die from coronavirus. Researchers are still trying to figure out whether this is due to biology or behaviour.\n\nInterestingly, the study found gender differences in intentions to wear a face covering basically disappeared in places were masks were made mandatory. In other words: men need to be forced to wear masks more than women do. You\u2019re obliged to wear face coverings whenever you can\u2019t socially distance in New York, which explains why I didn\u2019t notice any gender differences in my own study. So I won\u2019t give up hope of a Nobel prize for science quite yet.\n\nThe fact that a significant number of men (including Donald Trump) think masks make them look weak is yet another reminder of how damaging gender stereotypes are. The pressure to seem tough doesn\u2019t just prevent men from wearing masks, it prevents them from expressing their emotions and seeking help for mental health problems. It\u2019s one reason that men are 3.5 times more likely to die from suicide than women. Reluctance to show any sign of weakness also factors into why men don\u2019t go to the doctor as much as women do and why they\u2019re less likely to adopt preventative health measures. Toxic masculinity kills.\n\nMasks aren\u2019t particularly fun to wear, but they work. One recent research paper found that if 80% of Americans wore masks, Covid-19 infections rates would drop to approximately one twelfth the number of infections. So if you\u2019re a dude who is still fretting about face coverings I encourage you to think: What Would Newton Do? I\u2019m pretty sure he would wear a mask.\n\nAfghan hospital attackers \u2018came to kill the mothers\u2019\n\nA group of barbaric cowards entered a maternity hospital in Kabul \u201cwith the purpose of killing mothers in cold blood,\u201d the charity M\u00e9decins Sans Fronti\u00e8res has said. 24 people, mainly new mothers, died in the attack. 18 babies were left motherless. It\u2019s still not clear who is responsible but it is tragically apparent that two decades of war in Afghanistan has not done much for women\u2019s rights. As a CNN op-ed by Anushay Hossain notes, the US government has long exploited the plight of Afghan women to win the PR battle for the war. Thanks to US intervention, Laura Bush said in 2001, Afghan women were \u201cno longer imprisoned in their homes.\u201d But, says Hossain: \u201cHere we are, almost two decades later, with Afghan women and their babies being slaughtered. If they\u2019re not safe in maternity wards, how safe are they in their homes, or anywhere in the country?\u201d\n\nTrailblazing woman at center of US trans rights case dies aged 59\n\nAimee Stephens died at home on Tuesday after suffering complications of kidney disease; her wife was by her side.

Ancient world, that sort of thing? It\u2019s so difficult to tell with a man who wears his learning as lightly as the prime minister does. But we must ask after a distressing \u2013 and distressingly well-sourced \u2013 report in the Financial Times suggesting that the reason senior Tories want all MPs to return to sitting in parliament like, yesterday, is because they feel their man does better when he\u2019s backed up at the dispatch box by the only set of cheerleaders in the world you wouldn\u2019t want to have sex with (I\u2019m very slightly paraphrasing their comments). Poor prime minister. I believe the same thing happened in the Athenian agora to Socrates, who came across as a stuttering haystack unless he was supported by serried ranks of inadequates screaming \u201cno, YOU are!\u201d at his debating opponents.\n\nAnyway, given that Johnson is our Churchill \u2013 the insurance dog version \u2013 perhaps it was inevitable that he would need a few nodding dogs on the frontbench next to him. All governments seek to disguise their own shortcomings, which is also why this one refuses to countenance a Brexit extension despite the vast economic shock of the coronavirus. Far from taking pause, the Conservatives are embracing the timing with the sweaty gratitude of a guy who knows that the unfortunate fire at a storage unit facility will take care of the corpse he\u2019s been storing there.\n\nFor now, Johnson\u2019s chief danger zone seems to be his weekly encounters with Labour leader Keir Starmer at prime minister\u2019s questions. Like me, you probably don\u2019t watch this show on the regular, but I was stuck with it this Wednesday, having exhausted almost all other forms of TV content during the lockdown. First impressions \u2013 and no spoilers please, if you\u2019re ahead of me on the boxset \u2013 is that the House of Commons now has all the atmosphere of the Emirates, but in a good way. It leaves those at the dispatch box with nowhere to hide, which will reflexively discomfit a prime minister who has never entered a bedroom without first checking if there\u2019s a wardrobe.\n\nThat said, it\u2019s only right to include the opposing view from the senior No 10 adviser whose judgment was \u201cKeir Starmer is the one who was rattled.\u201d There is, of course, no objective reality, so by all means feel free to get behind this version, where forensic answerer Johnson made light work of the former director of public prosecutions. It does, however, seem more likely that the opposite version is believed by some, given that not one but three Conservative MPs on Thursday shared a far-right video that used fakery to attempt to discredit Starmer. Well done, Nadine Dorries, Lucy Allan, and Maria Caulfield, who eventually deleted their tweets but were in all cases too small and wet to apologise. As health minister, Nadine won\u2019t have a lot on at the moment, so who can blame her for passing the time sharing far-right content on the old Twitter website? But I\u2019d urge her to use it to look into the possibility of simply no-platforming Starmer if she is upset by the things he\u2019s saying.\n\nAs for Jacob Rees-Mogg\u2019s idea that parliament should \u201cset an example\u201d to the nation by returning to work before the test, trace and isolate infrastructure has been set up \u2026 it\u2019s one way of looking at it. A lot of people say they now watch all TV dramas and have moments where they catch themselves thinking that the characters aren\u2019t socially distancing. I\u2019m not quite there yet. But given that two MPs have already ended up fighting for their lives in intensive care units, I do think that were I to watch a prime minister\u2019s questions done in the old style, my mind would promptly slow it down to the speed of one of those science videos showing how a sneeze travels.\n\nPicture it now \u2013 the great clouds of microscopic droplets being atomised as Iain Duncan Smith turns up his volume again. The strings of mucus arcing gracefully through the air in balletic accompaniment to an absolutely vital interjection concerning this or that honourable gentleman. The festoons of saliva hanging in grateful service to some point with which the prime minister is being invited to agree. The ability to watch in real time London\u2019s R rate rising to nine in the cause of Rees-Mogg being able to bray \u201cfrit, sir!\u201d at a female shadow minister. Too important not to be worth it, surely.\n\nOnce they\u2019d finished, I\u2019d like the chamber cleared, the electric lights switched off, some ultraviolet lights switched on, and Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to go around, CSI style, pointing at the various stains and trace fluids spattered across the green benches, like a Jackson Pollock work entitled The Spread of Democracy. We\u2019ve got to have something to watch, after all, and it might as well be parliament setting one sort of example or another.\n\n\u2022 Marina Hyde is a Guardian columnist", "author": ["Marina Hyde"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2020/may/16/however-obedient-its-citizens-are-the-government-cant-help-but-revert-to-thuggish-type", "published": "2020-05-16T18:00:36", "title": "Our self-discipline is holding up but we're afraid. Speak clearly to us", "text": "The most shocking feature of the lockdown is not that it is fraying but that it has held at all. If you had listened to rightwing moralists, you would never have believed collective self-discipline was possible. For decades, they have lamented the decline in deference. In her first speech as leader of Conservative party, Margaret Thatcher saw liberal leftists as rats who \u201cgnaw away at our national self-respect\u201d. By debunking the glories of British history, and undermining religious and educational standards, they were turning the British into a rootless mob unable to act in its own or the national interest.\n\nLeftwing moralists reached the same conclusion but took a different road to hell. Capitalism turned citizens into consumers, who thought only of themselves. \u201cA market society automatically carries with it an undermining of solidarity,\u201d declared Noam Chomsky. It generates selfish individualists, unable to stick together. In our day, liberals have explained away Brexit, Trump and populism by citing the willingness of tens of millions to listen to idiot demagogues rather than the educated.\n\nAnd yet here we are, shorn of most traditional beliefs, the undoubted products of consumer capitalism, and still more or less sticking together and obeying the medical elite. I could go on in the style of George Orwell or JB Priestley at their sentimental worst and praise British decency. Although it exists in millions \u2013 whoever thought that it did not? \u2013 surely the reason why the British and so many other populations are obedient is that they are terrified. The only way the authorities can begin to clear up the mess they have made of this crisis is by understanding our fears and showing us how to improvise ways round them. Unfortunately, they show no sign of doing it.\n\nI should emphasise that the fear is a fear of the virus, not of the government. At the start of the crisis, many warned of the creation of a police state. They had every reason to be alarmed. Ministers had ordered the population to stay at home, as if it were an invading army imposing a curfew. Their emergency regulations allowed the police and public health officials to detain, test and interrogate everyone they thought might be infectious, and force them into quarantine if required. We were, in the words of the former supreme court judge Lord Sumption, losing our freedom in a fit of \u201ccollective hysteria\u201d.\n\nA police state requires police officers willing to enforce a dictatorship. The police aren\u2019t prepared to do it\n\nAs it has turned out, the hysteria has been on Sumption\u2019s side of the argument. A police state requires police officers willing to enforce a dictatorship. The police aren\u2019t prepared to do it. Nor has the Johnson government asked them to, for whatever faults the hopeless man has, he\u2019s not a dictator in the making. Correct me if I have missed them, but I can find no reports of officers herding the sick into quarantine. The police in England and Wales have merely issued about 9,000 fines for breaking the lockdown \u2013 usually to young people out in public spaces without reasonable excuse. I don\u2019t want to underestimate how the determination to protect the old by denying education and social life to the young will haunt this country for decades. But to put the punishments into perspective, the French police had issued 915,000 fines for breaking the lockdown as of 23 April \u2013 100 times as many. You can either believe that the English and Welsh are 100 times more law-abiding than the French or that chief constables have, on the whole, trusted the public to behave sensibly if given a little leeway. If there had been a determined effort by even 10% of the population to break the lockdown, it would never had held. As it is, people have done what was asked of them, more or less.\n\nHaving denigrated their fellow citizens for decades, moralists have seized on the solidarity. Rather than realising that people were hiding from a terrifying plague, Tories decided the nation was rallying round the flag and seeing Johnson as a new Churchill. From the other side, I have heard leftists bend the Tory line for their own purposes and assure me we are witnessing the public sacrificing its freedom for the sake of the NHS. The peak of the self-congratulation came in early May when the BBC ran a propaganda series, Our Finest Hours. It would show \u201chow the outbreak of Covid-19 has revived our nation\u2019s wartime spirit and once again we can be proud to be British,\u201d the tastelessly upbeat narrator told viewers. \u201cNow, as we did in World War Two, we are uniting in a common endeavour.\u201d\n\nSceptics could counter with the revelations of the unforgivable failure, not just of Johnson but also of the government\u2019s scientific advisers, to lock down soon enough. They might point to NHS managers\u2019 willingness to send infected patients into care homes and to threaten doctors who spoke out about the shortages of protective equipment. Not much common endeavour to be proud of there.\n\nRealists would do better to return to what matters above all else: the fear. There may never be a vaccine. Even if there is and it is available to all \u2013 a big if \u2013 the virus may mutate. We will need new ways of living with the fear outside lockdown. Indeed, we need them now. Yet, instead of explaining to people how they can safely travel and work, the government is reverting to its thuggish type. It is picking fights with teachers\u2019 unions asking reasonable questions about how schools can reopen. Instead of realising that the cooperation of the mayor of London is essential if the capital is to reopen, it goes for him because he\u2019s Labour and a remainer and therefore an enemy.\n\nIt\u2019s not just that the government is gnawing away at national self-respect, to use Thatcher\u2019s words. If it can\u2019t find the authority and patience to convince the public to overcome its fears, it will gnaw away at the nation\u2019s security.\n\n\u2022 Nick Cohen is an Observer columnist", "author": ["Nick Cohen"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/the-antidote-your-favourite-reads-beyond-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-15T07:29:39", "title": "The antidote: your favourite reads beyond coronavirus", "text": "If you\u2019re feeling overwhelmed by coverage of the pandemic, try this daily list of non-coronavirus articles our readers spent the most time with\n\n\u2018You can work productively with whatever you have, from giant chest freezers to single compartments in small fridges.

Maria Branyas is calling for a revolution in treatment of the elderly\n\nWeeks after ringing in her 113th birthday, she found herself confined to a room in her care home in north-eastern Spain, suffering from the effects of the coronavirus. Now Maria Branyas \u2013 fully recovered and believed to be the world\u2019s oldest Covid-19 survivor \u2013 is calling for nothing less than a new world order.\n\n\u201cIt will have to be done all over again and differently,\u201d said Branyas, describing such a transformation as a debt owed to those who died in the pandemic. \u201cGiven my age, I likely won\u2019t be there. But believe me a new order is needed.\u201d\n\nNews that Branyas, Spain\u2019s oldest living person, had survived the virus made headlines around the world last week, offering a moment of cheer from one of the world\u2019s hardest-hit countries. Across Spain, the virus has claimed more than 27,500 lives.\n\nCovid-19 began making its way through the yellow-painted hallways of Branyas\u2019s care home in the city of Olot, some 70 miles north of Barcelona, in late March. Brushing aside their own fears and anxieties over the contagion, staff at the home continued to care for the residents. Still, the virus charted a deadly course, killing at least 17 of the 133 people living there.\n\nThis pandemic shows older people are the forgotten ones of our society \u2013 they don't deserve to leave the world this way Maria Branyas\n\nCovid-19 left Branyas \u2013 who has lived through the 1918 flu, two world wars and Spain\u2019s civil war \u2013 sick for just a handful of days. But she reeled from the deeper mark left by the pandemic, as it laid bare a society that, as she sees it, had pushed its elderly to the margins.\n\n\u201cThis pandemic has revealed that older people are the forgotten ones of our society,\u201d she said in an interview with the Observer, carried out with the help of one of her daughters. \u201cThey fought their whole lives, sacrificed time and their dreams for today\u2019s quality of life. They didn\u2019t deserve to leave the world in this way.\u201d\n\nThe virus has charged through Spain\u2019s more than 5,000 care homes, killing an estimated 17,500 residents. A similar story has played out across Europe with as many as half of all Covid-19 deaths believed to have taken place in care homes in Italy, France, Ireland and Belgium.\n\nIn Spain, where the reverence shown towards the elderly is a point of pride, the pandemic has forced a reckoning with an industry that has long fended off complaints of funding and staff shortages.\n\nBefore the pandemic, seniors had shared stories of waiting hours to go to the bathroom or receive a drink of water. Others had grappled with ant infestations or cockroaches, while staff at one home complained of being forced to ration essential items such as nappies and soap.\n\n\u201cThis is the situation in our care homes \u2013 not during the pandemic but in the last decade,\u201d M\u00e1s Madrid politician Pablo G\u00f3mez Perpiny\u00e0 told the regional assembly last month. \u201cThis is our how elderly have had to face the virus.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Maria Branyas at her care home in Spain.\n\nThe horrific situation came to light in March after the military was deployed to disinfect care homes. \u201cThe army found seniors who had been completely abandoned, some dead, in their beds,\u201d the defence minister, Margarita Robles, told broadcaster Telecinco.\n\nProsecutors in Spain said this month that they had opened 140 investigations into care homes, prompted by complaints from family members and relatives. The Federaci\u00f3n Empresarial de la Dependencia, an industry association that represents care homes in Spain, told Spanish broadcaster esRadio that homes had been left to care for residents after overwhelmed hospitals refused to take in more patients or to send care homes the appropriate medications.\n\nSpeaking from the care home where she has lived for nearly two decades, Branyas offered solutions. \u201cIt\u2019s as though those of us who choose to live in a care home have disappeared from society,\u201d she said. \u201cGovernments need to pay attention and provide funding and qualified staff in care homes. And, above all, they need to provide much more healthcare in homes.\u201d\n\nWith the help of an account set up and run by her daughter, Branyas last year made her social media debut \u2013 her Twitter bio reads: \u201cI\u2019m old, very old, but not an idiot\u201d \u2013 after she was recognised by the Gerontology Research Group as Spain\u2019s oldest known living person and believed to be among the 30 oldest people in the world. Records kept by Club 110, a forum run by one of the group\u2019s directors, suggest that Branyas is the world\u2019s oldest Covid-19 survivor.\n\nBorn in 1907 in the United States, where her Spanish father was working as a journalist, Branyas moved to Spain in 1915. As the 1918 flu swept across the world, she was living on the outskirts of a small village in Catalonia, seemingly unaffected by the pandemic, said daughter Rosa Moret.\n\nHer mother rarely speaks of the past, she added. \u201cShe says it\u2019s better not to think about these things, you have to keep looking forward. I think that\u2019s why she\u2019s lived so long.\u201d\n\nBranyas was instead happier to outline the changes she hoped her 13 great-grandchildren would see in their lives. \u201cA change in values, one that prioritises education, health and research,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd fewer weapons and far less spending on so many politicians.\u201d\n\nShe laughed off a question over what comes next after fighting off the coronavirus. \u201cWell, I\u2019ll live,\u201d she said. \u201cUntil God wants.\u201d", "author": ["Ashifa Kassam"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/world/2020/may/15/patient-amusing-inspirational-teachers-ace-lockdown-coronavirus", "published": "2020-05-15T10:00:22", "title": "Patient, amusing, inspirational... teachers have always made a difference", "text": "The Upside weekly newsletter celebrates the teachers who have made a difference to our lives in lockdown\n\nI was eavesdropping on my son\u2019s remote A-level history lesson, and liked what I heard.\n\nIt was all about Henry VII, who ruthlessly sought new ways to pay for a heavily indebted state (sound familiar, Rishi Sunak?).

Figures from the Office for Budget Responsibility, the independent body responsible for forecasting the public finances, showed the economy suffering a 35% decline in output between April and the end of June and a rise in unemployment to at least 10%.\n\nThe cost of measures such as the Treasury\u2019s furlough scheme, which has paid employers to send home over 7 million workers, will send the public spending deficit above 15% this year, 50% higher than the worst period following the 2008 crash.\n\nLeft-leaning thinktanks and academics have lined up to condemn plans for a return to austerity, saying it would harm the recovery, and adding that further government borrowing would be needed to secure a return to growth after the virus-induced mothballing of the economy.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Boris Johnson announced that there are no plans to impose a public sector wage freeze or other austerity measures.

Even an austerity hawk believes it is different this time.\n\n\u201cThe last thing you want to do is amplify the prospects of a full-blown depression,\u201d he added.\n\nPolicy Exchange, founded in 2002 by Michael Gove, the Cabinet Office chief, Tory peer Francis Maude, former MP Nick Boles and businessman Archie Norman, has a loyal following in the cabinet and has claimed to be behind several recent Tory policies.\n\nLightfoot said low interest rates meant the government could borrow cheaply to invest in infrastructure to get the economy back on its feet.\n\nMatthew Lesh, head of research at the Adam Smith Institute, founded in the 1970s to promote free-market policies, said: \u201cEven fiscally hawkish people have less of a problem with the current increase in debt levels.\u201d\n\nTom Clougherty, head of tax at the Centre for Policy Studies, said: \u201cI\u2019d usually be wary of big public investment schemes In the current circumstances, though, with borrowing costs very low and little prospect of crowding out private investment, I think the pros outweigh the cons.\u201d\n\nThe CPS was founded in the 1970s to combat socialism by former MP Keith Joseph, a close friend and supporter of Margaret Thatcher.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The public sector deficit is expected to climb by at least \u00a3300bn this year.

It was introduced in 2015 as part of hostile environment laws designed to discourage illegal immigration and combat health tourism. The surcharge must be paid alongside taxes and national insurance contributions.\n\nDr Chandra Kanneganti, the national chair of the British International Doctors Association, said: \u201cWe know BAME doctors are disproportionately getting ill. To have to pay for the same service that they are putting their lives at risk for doesn\u2019t seem fair. This charge needs to be scrapped completely for NHS overseas workers.\u201d\n\nThe Home Office said the surcharge raised about \u00a3900m for the NHS between 2015 and 2018-19. During this time the cost has repeatedly risen and healthcare workers have said they struggled to pay the fees. For other doctors and nurses, the charges are probably a deterrent when they consider coming to the UK.\n\nAt the daily Downing Street coronavirus briefing last month, Patel said in response to a detailed question from ITV regarding the surcharge: \u201cWe have a range of measures that are, like most things in government, under review, and we are looking at everything including visas, surcharge \u2026 We are looking at everything we can do to continue to support everyone on the frontline in the NHS.\u201d\n\nA Home Office spokesperson said: \u201cAs the home secretary said, in light of the exceptional circumstances that coronavirus presents, it is right that policies are kept under review.\n\n\u201cThis includes how the immigration health surcharge applies.

Two months ago if someone approached me with a mask I\u2019d either run or evade them somehow.

Instead they had begun recruiting drug users and in some instances had enticed them, rather than their own members, to inflict violence on rivals.\n\n\u201cAs well as child exploitation we are now seeing exploitation of vulnerable drug users. Some are being used as proxies to commit violence.

He was under no illusions about very old age \u2013 at one point in our conversation there came some pragmatic deliberation about the best way to kill yourself when the time came. But he was also keen to stamp on a few old-people cliches.\n\nWhat is it about ageing that is so confronting? \u2013 Full Story podcast Read more\n\nHe told me of an elderly man brought to an appointment by his children. They were deeply concerned, wanting him assessed for dementia. His major symptom was falling in love with a sex worker, moving her into his house, giving her money and property. The doctor reluctantly put him through rounds of rigorous tests \u2013 and found absolutely nothing wrong with his cognition or psychology. He was sane, he was loved, he was happy. The doctor hooted with delight as he told me this story.\n\nLater, he asked me: \u201cHow many years of your life would you trade for a Booker Prize?\u201d\n\n\u201cWhat?! None!\u201d I replied. I was surprised at the vehemence and speed of my answer, and that I knew it to be absolutely true.\n\nThen he asked, \u201cWhat if they were the years between 85 and 95?\u201d\n\nHmmm.\n\n***\n\nMy friend J reports on her mother, very slowly dying in a nursing home. She\u2019s in her late 90s, and so frail her heart has not the strength to push blood to the extremities of her body. Her hands and feet are bloodless, cold. Yet when she\u2019s wheeled into a patch of sunshine in the garden, she smiles with deep, sensual pleasure. \u201cHow lovely this is,\u201d she says, with relish. Soaking up the warmth, the sound of the trees moving above her.\n\nJ\u2019s sister leaves a nursing home visit one day in bleak distress. \u201cI can\u2019t go in there any more,\u201d she says.\n\nJ agrees that it\u2019s very hard, but is curious: What especially prompted this today?\n\nHer sister\u2019s expression is almost angry. \u201cIt\u2019s that she just \u2013 lies there.

Is it a biological imperative, to turn away as soon as we catch its reflection?\n\n***\n\nIn 2015, a review in an Australian newspaper rebuked Edna O\u2019Brien for her wild, chaotic and (I thought) stupendously adventurous novel, The Little Red Chairs. The reviewer\u2019s main point was not so much that the book was flawed, though it surely is, but more importantly that the cause of these flaws was the author\u2019s advanced age. What I read, between the faux-respectful lines, was an unprinted command to O\u2019Brien: You\u2019re old. You\u2019re embarrassing yourself. Shut up.\n\nO\u2019Brien was 85 at the time. Now she\u2019s 89 and her new novel, Girl, about the Nigerian girls abducted by Boko Haram, was published in September 2019.\n\nNot shutting up, then.\n\n***\n\nOur predictions for old age foresee an epoch of physical incapacity and psychic misery, in contrast with our vital, flourishing youth. But last night on my couch I spent five minutes scribbling down a list of the troubles that plagued me and those in my social circle \u2013 middle class, well educated, well resourced \u2013 before we turned 50.\n\nThe list: Major depression. Anorexia and bulimia. A birth malformation necessitating 15 years of agonisingly painful surgery and follow-up. Panic attacks and agoraphobia. Kidney disease. Broken arms and legs. Chronic, intensifying lung disease. Bipolar disorder leading to job and relationship loss, financial disaster. Endometriosis. Crohn\u2019s disease and irritable bowel syndrome with frequent hospitalisation. Asthma, fatal. Asthma, chronic, multiple hospitalisations. Excruciating diverticulitis. Migraines and an inability to hold a job. Severe postnatal depression. HIV/AIDs, mostly fatal. Type 1 diabetes and complications. Juvenile arthritis with attendant chronic immobilising pain. Major paranoid psychosis, forced hospitalisation and trauma. Cardiac problems, multiple open-heart surgeries. Schizophrenia causing lifelong inability to work and extreme social isolation. Melanoma. Bowel cancer, fatal. Breast cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Brain cancer, fatal and non-fatal. Stevens-Johnson syndrome caused by medical malpractice. Stomach cancer, fatal. Strokes, locked-in syndrome, fatal. Severe addiction to illegal drugs, alcohol, prescription painkillers. Chronic and acute immobilising pain in spine, knee, neck, foot. Knee and shoulder surgery, severely limiting mobility. High blood pressure. Car accidents, frequently fatal. Farm accidents. Multiple sclerosis. Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome. Suicide attempts. Suicide.\n\nAfter five minutes I stopped scribbling. Excluding a couple of the cancers, almost all of these issues had first occurred before age 30; many have persisted into the fifth and sixth decades. Yet some cognitive dissonance allows us to perceive even long-term disorders in youth as somehow aberrant, manageable and far less horrifying than the potential \u201cdegradations\u201d of old age.\n\nI recently saw a birthday card carrying the image of a haughtily elegant middle-aged woman in 1950s attire. The caption read, \u201cHoney, you couldn\u2019t pay me to be 20.\u201d I bought it immediately.\n\nThe day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power\n\nI was not a happy or a healthy young person. I had chronic asthma exacerbated by smoking; I was unfit; my diet was ordinary. \u201cOrphaned\u201d by 29, I spent most of my 20s and 30s in grief. I was deeply anxious with little confidence, my fretful neediness causing relationship problems. For many of those years, I cried every week.\n\nThe day I turned 50, I felt a mysterious surge of what I could only think of as power. A deep optimism, energy and peacefulness took up space inside me. Give or take a few crises since, it hasn\u2019t really left. In my mid-50s I\u2019m physically and emotionally stronger, healthier, more calmly loved and loving, more productive, more organised, smarter, wealthier and exponentially happier than I ever was in my youth. In the past four years I\u2019ve really cried about three times, on one occasion because a good friend died.\n\nI mentioned my mid-life happiness at a public event once. A woman in the audience called out cheerfully, \u201cYou think it\u2019s great when you\u2019re 50 \u2013 wait till you\u2019re 70!\u201d\n\nThere are global studies showing what\u2019s called \u201cthe paradox of age\u201d, a U-curve revealing that from childhood onwards happiness declines, and then dramatically rises. We\u2019re most miserable in our 40s, but things pick up around 50; happiness at 90 far exceeds that at 18. This upswing is partly owing to life experience, but is also a direct result of getting older, say psychologists: \u201cThe biological, cognitive and emotional changes of ageing itself \u2026 result in better emotional regulation, greater equanimity and compassion, more comfort with ambiguity, deeper gratitude and a focus upon meaningful engagement in the present.\u201d\n\nBirthday card from the website annetaintor.com Photograph: annetaintor.com\n\nHaving published a novel about older women, I\u2019m now seeing evidence of joyful, mischievous ageing everywhere I go. A woman at a book event tells me that at 77, she\u2019d resigned herself to a life that was winding down, finishing up. Instead, she says in astonishment, \u201cI can\u2019t stop the ideas coming. I just have ideas and ideas and ideas!\u201d She motions with both hands outwards from her head, in a delighted gesture of pouring abundance. Her husband sits beside her, beaming.\n\nAnother day I overhear two women \u2013 perhaps they\u2019re 80 \u2013 outside a cinema. One tells the other she\u2019s being badgered to visit her daughter, a long drive away in the country. She looks into the middle distance, then says serenely, \u201cI think she wants me to go before I lose my licence.\u201d The two women look at each other for a second, then burst into wild cackles. They gather their bags and stride into the movie house.\n\n***\n\nWhat am I afraid of, when I think about old age? I\u2019d like to say nothing, but that would be untrue. Dementia, obviously. Relentless physical pain so bad it eclipses small pleasures. Being forced to live with people I dislike. Loss of autonomy. The kind of poverty that destroys autonomy. Unstinting boredom caused by an inability to read or hear.\n\nI fear becoming a bitter, self-pitying person. Taking up genealogy. Boring other people to death with my \u2018wonderful stories\u2019.\n\nWhat am I not afraid of? Living alone. Being \u201cinvisible\u201d. The body\u2019s gradual decline, notwithstanding the above. Death.\n\nIt\u2019s possible I\u2019m completely deluded. When these things befall me, I\u2019ll probably be terrified.\n\n***\n\nIn \u201cWhy we can\u2019t tell the truth about ageing\u201d, an article in the New Yorker, Arthur Krystal sneers at the recent proliferation of \u201cfeel-good\u201d books about getting older. It\u2019s sheer trendiness to put a positive spin on growing old, Krystal grouches: the truth is, it sucks \u2013 please let\u2019s stop the lying.\n\nUnconvinced by the U-curve, then.\n\nBut he has a point. It\u2019s true that alongside the horror and revulsion there has now emerged quite a bit of jolly crusading about the fabulousness of old age. Like Krystal, I too find irksome the anti-ageism books refusing to acknowledge the downsides, those calling for a special new language with which to \u201ccelebrate\u201d ageing. Ditto the idiotic, sappy memes that pop up now and then on social media. (Wrinkles are engraved smiles? Jesus Christ.) Nor am I drawn to heartwarming movies in the genre that New York Times critic Neil Genzlinger calls Old People Behaving Hilariously. I cheer when Anjelica Huston sniffs her disdain for \u201capologetically humble or humiliating\u201d film roles, like one in \u201can old-lady cheerleader movie\u201d. I\u2019m with you, Anjelica, I think. When I\u2019m 67 I want my work taken seriously, too. But then I see a response from Jacki Weaver, who\u2019s in the old-lady cheerleader movie. When she read Huston\u2019s comments, Weaver says, \u201cI just laughed. And then I said, \u2018Well, she can go fuck herself.\u2019\u201d\n\nI snort jubilantly into my coffee cup. Go, Jacki. I\u2019m with you, too.\n\n***\n\nPalliative care nurses have told me people almost always die as they live. A person who has lived with acceptance and gratitude will die in gracious acceptance. One who\u2019s lived in bitterness and entitlement and anger will likely die in the same state. Suddenly it\u2019s blindingly obvious to me that ageing is the same; all our prior years are practice for the hard stuff of getting old. When I think of the old individuals I know who express delight and curiosity, a sense of purpose and appreciation, in ordinary daily life, I realise that give or take a few tragedies, they\u2019ve always been this way. It\u2019s their default state. When I think of the unhappiest old people I know \u2013 victimised, spiteful, ungrateful for small pleasures, eternally dissatisfied and offended \u2013 I look back and see those traits governing their early and middle years too.\n\nNote to self: Practise hard.\n\nQuestion to self: When is it too late to change one\u2019s default state?\n\n***\n\nThe Good Weekend magazine carries an account of life in a nursing home (\u201cone of the good ones\u201d) by a perceptive retired journalist in his early 80s. He writes brilliantly, the by-line is a pseudonym and the article is gloomy stuff. One of the worst things is enduring mealtimes with a fellow resident as she snatches and grasps, losing her manners, insulting the staff, bullying a vulnerable woman.\n\nNobody talks about what will happen when nobody wants our work any more\n\nA week later, a letter appears from an 84-year-old retired pathologist. His experience of residential care, \u201cin an affluent Melbourne suburb\u201d, is much better. Ageing, writes Peter Thomson of Ivanhoe, \u201cis inevitable, inexorable and interesting. AAA rating for ageing: Anticipate, Adapt, Accept\u201d.\n\nAgeing is interesting! I keep this letter and think of it often. It might be the most uplifting set of instructions I\u2019ve ever read.\n\nIt also points to something else that\u2019s scary: positive ageing takes money.\n\nMy partner and I talk about our Sydney mortgage. Unless suddenly showered with astonishing riches \u2013 unlikely \u2013 we\u2019ll have paid it off when he turns 78 and I\u2019m 76. I think: we\u2019ll just move to the country. We\u2019ll just move into a bedsit. We\u2019ll just move. As if that will solve everything.\n\nWhen I talk to other people in the arts about \u201cretirement plans\u201d, we laugh grimly. One says hers is to poke out an eye with the car aerial and claim compensation. Another has his sights on a salubrious cardboard box on the median strip as a retirement villa. Nobody has any superannuation to speak of \u2013 when the average writer\u2019s income is $11,000 per year, where would it come from?\n\nWe\u2019ll all just keep working, we say gamely. We\u2019ll keep writing, painting, performing. How could we stop, anyway? We wouldn\u2019t want to stop. We talk about Matisse and his paper cut-outs, Edna O\u2019Brien, Wallace Stegner. Adapting, accepting, but always making, always working.\n\nNone of us states the obvious: we\u2019re not Matisse, or O\u2019Brien, or Stegner. Nobody talks about what will happen when nobody wants our work any more.\n\n***\n\nIn recent years it\u2019s come to me that the point of all our living is to get ready to die. People laugh when I say this out loud. How morbid to think of death all the time! But I don\u2019t find it morbid. I find it interesting, a purposeful exercise, considering how to live \u2013 to strive towards living \u2013 with that readiness inside us.\n\nThe Jungian psychologist James Hillman posits that the purpose of human ageing is to fulfil our true character, to become our essential selves. More radically, he suggests that ageing might be \u201ca transformation in beauty as much as in biology\u201d. And then he asks a shocking question: could ageing itself be conceived of as an art form?\n\nI think the deepest dread is of being reduced, simplified\n\nIf it can, then maybe artists can teach us to practise it. Push beyond your first ideas, they might say. Develop a tolerance for solitude, and for failure. Make your mark, defend it, then challenge it, overturn it.\n\nJerry Saltz: \u201cDon\u2019t think good or bad.

I think the deepest dread is of being reduced, simplified. We\u2019re afraid that, to paraphrase British psychologist and writer Susie Orbach, we\u2019ll be \u201crobbed of the richness of who we are\u201d \u2013 our complexity stripped away by forces beyond our control. This reduction is already happening with the cheerleaders on one side, the catastrophisers on the other. Ours is an all-or-nothing, black-and-white-thinking culture; we picture ourselves as either relentlessly active, plank posing and Camino walking and cycling into our 90s, or dribbling in a nursing-home chair, waiting for death.\n\nBut maybe we don\u2019t have to choose either extreme to dwell on. Maybe we can be Anjelica and Jacki; be large, contain multitudes. Perhaps, instead of capitulating to reduction, we can keep adding to our concept of how to age \u2013 turn our thinking about oldness into an art, and keep exploring it. Doing something to it, and doing something else.\n\nThis article was first published in Griffith Review 68: Getting On (Text) as Experiments in the Art of Living (ed Ashley Hay)\n\nCharlotte Wood is the author of The Natural Way of Things and The Weekend", "author": ["Charlotte Wood"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2020/may/16/ruth-hunt-at-oxford-i-found-other-girls-wjho-liked-girls-cheap-alcohol-and-smoking", "published": "2020-05-16T17:00:35", "title": "Ruth Hunt: \u2018At Oxford I found other girls who liked girls and smoking\u2019", "text": "The LGBTQ+ campaigner, 40, talks about growing up gay, becoming a baroness and still longing for a cigarette\n\nScrewing up was never an option.

I remember going on adventures with my older brother and, when I was 11, being allowed to go to the corner shop alone, and filling up a bag with penny chews, Fruit Salads, Bruiser bars and Black Jacks.\n\nMy parents fostered about 100 children from when I was four onwards. Some stayed for 24 hours and some for 13 years. We were always getting folding chairs out of the garage and budging up to make space at the table or putting another jacket potato in the oven.\n\nMy parents tended to cook big batch food because there was always the possibility that other children would turn up with their carrier bag and shoes and we had to gently bring them out of their shells. One of the big catalysts for that was firstly sitting them at the table and eating with them. Only as an adult do I understand the emotional significance and security of that.\n\nI\u2019d been at the end of my tether as a single mother writing a political blog. Then I became a trainee reporter on the Southend Echo. I can tell you exactly what I ate then at my desk \u2013 pasta with butter and the occasional scotch egg, out of Tupperware. I had basically no money until my first pay cheque came through, but when it did I put some chicken in my pasta. And some cheese, if I was being profligate.\n\nI remember when my mother first took me to a proper hairdresser, instead of having her friend Julie round, or my nan\u2019s friend Lois to trim my fringe at the dining table. He was Barry at Legend in the town centre. It was the first time I had biscotti with tea and I said, embarrassingly, \u201cThese biscuits are really hard\u201d, when they were meant to be.\n\nLast night I ate a whole family-size macaroni cheese. I\u2019d planned to put half back in the fridge. I have a surprisingly large appetite anyway and I don\u2019t drive, I walk everywhere, I don\u2019t sit down at the moment and I pace the hallway when I\u2019m on the phone. I think that if I didn\u2019t eat large amounts of carbs and cheese I would wither away into a husk.\n\nI did take testosterone for six to nine months and I was very hungry and very randy all the time. A most dangerous combination. I stopped \u2013 and I\u2019ve got to be careful how I word this \u2013 basically, I got as far down that path as I wanted to go. I never wished to transition to be a man, I just wanted to knock some of my edges off. The thing about testosterone is that when you stop taking it, you soften back up again, although I\u2019ve still got a few extra hairs on my chin which will never go away. But what that period taught me is that I\u2019m pretty comfortable in this skin as it is. But I think if I hadn\u2019t done it \u2013 and my story is in no way representative of other people \u2013 it would have driven me mad.\n\nIf I\u2019ve learned anything in the last seven or eight years it\u2019s that my career flies by the seat of my pants and that every time I\u2019m booked for something, I\u2019m ill, and anything \u2013 like a TV opportunity \u2013 I treat as my last ever one because it\u2019s maybe my swansong. It\u2019s impossible to plan for the future and I don\u2019t take anything for granted. I\u2019m consistently surprised when I\u2019m commissioned to do anything, despite appearances.\n\nMy back-up plan, if everything dries up, is going back to the supermarket, where I\u2019ve worked before. I\u2019ll sit on the checkout and, as food passes, I\u2019ll say: \u201cDo you know what you could do with that? I have a great recipe for that.\u201d\n\nMy favourite things\n\nFood\n\nIn my nan\u2019s spare bedroom I found a row of Jilly Cooper novels and in one it said that the female protagonist had a body which looked like it had been raised entirely on tinned peaches. I thought, \u201cGreat, that\u2019s a diet I can go with\u201d, and I\u2019ve noshed down on them ever since.\n\nDrink\n\nI gave up a year-and-a-half ago. I\u2019ve fallen off the wagon, in a minor way, a couple of times since but think I\u2019ve got a handle on it. Nowadays, in the evening, I\u2019ll make a Thermos flask of tea and take it to bed.\n\nDish to make\n\nMy auntie Helen, a minuscule woman we stayed with in Plymouth during summers, would often make avgolemono soup; as would Mother, at 3pm on Sundays. It\u2019s something that underpins really comforting moments of my childhood and, as an adult, I keep a vat of it on the stove to feed friends and loved ones when under the weather.\n\nRestaurant\n\nA fantastic little Umbrian restaurant in Soho called Vasco and Piero\u2019s, where I took [my partner] Louisa early in our relationship.

He talks about life with autism and finding peace in the wilds of Northern Ireland\n\nIt is a challenging time to be 16 and, like his peers, Dara McAnulty must currently endure a form of house arrest that means no seeing friends, no GCSEs. Unlike other locked-down teens, McAnulty is also dealing with the harsh mischance of having his first book, Diary of a Young Naturalist, published during the coronavirus crisis. He was supposed to be touring festivals but every date is cancelled. \u201cI feel like my being is suffering from a slow puncture,\u201d McAnulty tweeted in March. \u201cI honestly feel like my world is falling apart right now.\u201d\n\nWhen we meet via a video call a month later, his mood has lifted. Lockdown is tough. His mum, R\u00f3is\u00edn \u2013 who McAnulty likes to have by his side, discreetly, during interviews \u2013 contracted coronavirus quite severely; meanwhile, he feels \u201ctrapped\u201d and is \u201cbouncing around the house like a ping pong ball\u201d. Mercifully, over the road from their modern housing estate is a wood where he takes his daily exercise. \u201cIf I didn\u2019t have it, I would be utterly insane,\u201d he says. \u201cThe ground there is alive with peacock butterflies\u201d, and that morning, he saw a red squirrel \u201cso that makes the day\u201d, he grins.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McAnulty\u2019s campaigning has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg. Photograph: PR\n\nThere is a genuine buzz around his debut, a combination of nature book and memoir, a warm portrait of a close-knit family and a coming-of-age story. Robert Macfarlane has hailed his \u201cextraordinary voice and vision\u201d; Chris Packham has become a friend; Steve Silberman, author of NeuroTribes, called him \u201cinspiring\u201d. The teenager\u2019s environmental activism has led to comparisons with Greta Thunberg.\n\nMcAnulty is autistic, and it would be easy to file his book alongside Packham\u2019s Fingers in the Sparkle Jar which gave a vivid insight into the naturalist\u2019s Asperger\u2019s but Dara has his own style. Simple, gorgeous sentences unfurl, one after another. Of a hot summer\u2019s day, he writes: \u201cDragonflies are whizzing, grasshoppers are trembling in the grass, and swallows are everywhere.\u201d Or: \u201cThe valley sings, heaves and rests.\u201d There are original, imaginative descriptions too \u2013 caterpillars move \u201clike slow-motion accordions\u201d and a goshawk chick looks \u201clike an autumn forest rolled in the first snows of winter\u201d.\n\nHe lives with his dad, Paul, mum and younger siblings, Lorcan and Bl\u00e1thnaid, in a small rented three-bedroom house in Castlewellan, Northern Ireland. As a young child, Dara loved to bang on about black holes to anyone who would listen, and was diagnosed as autistic when he was five. In fact, R\u00f3is\u00edn, Lorcan and Bl\u00e1thnaid are also autistic; only Paul, a conservation scientist, is not. The teenager describes his family as \u201cas close as otters\u201d. They are also punk lovers, chaotic and \u201cpretty formidable, apparently\u201d.\n\nMcAnulty exudes energy and laughs a lot. His voice, however, belongs to an older man, and his writing is often unexpectedly wise too. When I ask about literary inspiration, he answers immediately: Seamus Heaney. \u201cYou can reread his poems again and again\u201d; there are \u201call these different compartments like bubbles. You pop them one at a time and there\u2019s no centre to it. There\u2019s this saying about a brain: if a brain was simple enough to understand, we\u2019d be too stupid to understand that brain. That\u2019s almost the same as Seamus Heaney\u2019s poems because they have such complex connections.\u201d\n\nTwitter opened my entire world to like-minded people \u2013 you\u2019ll always find someone to talk to about mycelial networks\n\nHe also enjoys reading Ursula K Le Guin, is currently \u201cneck-deep\u201d in his umpteenth rereading of The Lord of the Rings, and is fond of Agatha Christie for her focus on people\u2019s hidden motives. \u201cThat\u2019s been quite important to me because I try my best to learn about humans so I can make acceptable social interactions.\u201d\n\nA teacher once told McAnulty he would never be able to string a paragraph together. He was miserable \u2013 \u201cand miserable is an understatement\u201d \u2013 at a succession of schools, including Oscar Wilde\u2019s alma mater, Portora. The bullying (he didn\u2019t know how to make small talk about Minecraft) intensified as he became a teenager. The noise and clutter of classrooms made them the worst environment for him.\n\nMcAnulty learned that being in nature helped. \u201cI can\u2019t speak for all autistic people, but I feel things more intensely. In a shopping centre there\u2019s all of those different noises coming from different angles \u2013 my brain can\u2019t process them quickly enough, and everything goes completely crazy. Being out in nature, the sounds are quite level and I find it easier with muted colours. Everything just works. It\u2019s not oppressive.\u201d\n\nHe wrote from a young age, on scraps of paper. \u201cOne of my ways of processing the world is writing things down,\u201d he says. Then social media helped him find a path. Aged 12, he began a blog about nature and joined Twitter. \u201cFour years ago I wouldn\u2019t have been able to talk to you right now,\u201d he says. \u201cTwitter opened my world to like-minded people. You\u2019ll always find someone who is willing to talk to you about mycelial networks. It\u2019s given me so many opportunities to connect with people and not feel so isolated.\u201d\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest McAnulty with his brother, Lorcan, and sister, Bl\u00e1thnaid\n\nAs McAnulty wrote, and also took his first steps in environmental activism \u2013 campaigning to end the persecution of birds of prey \u2013 his blog gained readers and admirers. Three years ago, he appeared on Springwatch and was befriended by Packham. Adrian Cooper and Gracie Burnett, the husband-and-wife team behind tiny independent publisher Little Toller spotted his writing and began talking to his family about a book.\n\nDiary of a Young Naturalist tells the story of McAnulty\u2019s year from spring equinox to spring equinox, from his 14th to 15th birthday. It was a difficult time. His family moved from one side of Northern Ireland to the other and he had to cope with changing schools and losing his cherished wild heartlands, a forest called Big Dog. \u201cWhen I was younger, I remember moving from a school I absolutely hated. Even though I wanted to get out of that place with every single fibre of my body, still, in the back of my mind, I was going: \u2018I don\u2019t want change.\u2019\u201d\n\nThe move from Big Dog precipitated a breakdown, where McAnulty ended up screaming in panic in his garden. His struggles that summer were not helped by the rise of social media trolling (the downside of forging those positive connections). \u201cRemoving\u201d himself from Big Dog \u201cwas devastating, as if it killed a part of me. Then I went up into the Mournes\u201d \u2013 the mountain range close to his new home \u2013 \u201cand everything became fine again.\u201d Was his recovery as simple as that? \u201cNo, but it definitely helped discovering a new place and building up a new connection with the land. I slowly crawled my way back into some semblance of a calm state of mind. Exploring was a really big part of that, trying to find new places to root myself.\u201d\n\nWriting was followed by a seven-month edit with Cooper and his parents. \u201cAll my family got together, trying to coax this book into something that was manageable,\u201d says McAnulty. But R\u00f3is\u00edn says she wouldn\u2019t want people to think his writing was overly shaped by others. \u201cAlthough it has been edited sensitively and beautifully, the first draft was actually incredible.\u201d\n\nRewriting was a mixed blessing for McAnulty, forcing him to \u201cre-experience\u201d memories both traumatic and joyful. \u201cI uncovered things about myself along the way. It\u2019s like reading a book for the second time. I had to drag myself back through that thornbush. But I understood myself all the better because of it.\u201d\n\nWe see a problem and we need to fix it. So when politicians seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier\n\nAfter his breakdown, he started at a new school. Despite huge anxiety, in the book he finds kindred souls and a nurturing environment. \u201cIt has been the best school I\u2019ve had,\u201d he says. He still has to flee lessons at times but \u201cI have, dare I say it, friends now, for the first time ever. I\u2019ve had the best luck in the world \u2026 I managed to land myself in a year group that was basically made up of nerds.\u201d\n\nMcAnulty plans to take biology \u2013 his first love \u2013 alongside maths, chemistry and politics at A-level. He is currently writing a picture book for younger children and anticipates a career in conservation science. Activism takes up an increasing portion of his time. He runs a project to satellite-tag birds of prey, an eco group at school, and is prominent in his generation\u2019s call for action over the climate and biodiversity crises. Although the British government last year became the first major economy to make a legal commitment to \u201cnet zero\u201d carbon emissions by 2050, these are still only words, he believes, and his generation is becoming impatient. \u201cWe see a problem and we need to fix it. So when [politicians] don\u2019t fix it and seem to be making excuses we get angrier and angrier.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, McAnulty keeps his family, and the simple glories of the natural world, close. His favourite time is dusk, when \u201cthe night sky seems to chase the sun out of the sky and you can\u2019t really see the sun\u2019s light but you know it\u2019s just underneath the horizon,\u201d he says. \u201cAt that time, the energy in the air is so charged. That\u2019s when the bats begin to come out, and you feel such a rush.\u201d\n\n\u2022 Diary of a Young Naturalist by Dara McAnulty is published by Little Toller (RRP \u00a316).

The family struggled with poverty during her childhood in Barbados; her home life was marred by violent arguments and her father\u2019s crippling drug and alcohol addictions. At school though, her teachers recorded that she was sure of herself, intelligent and \u201cvery observant of her environment\u201d. By the time she was 10, Rihanna had become a carer to her two younger brothers while her mother worked to support them. Her parents later divorced.\n\nIf humble, troubled beginnings go some way to explain the drive of the most successful stars, then Rihanna makes a bold claim to be among the biggest. At 32, she enters the Sunday Times Rich list as Britain\u2019s wealthiest female musician.\n\nBorn Robyn Rihanna Fenty, the pop megastar-turned-businesswoman has a fortune estimated at \u00a3468m. Eligible for inclusion in the newspaper\u2019s annual list since she moved to London over a year ago, Rihanna, who enters the musicians\u2019 category at No 3 after Andrew Lloyd Webber and Paul McCartney, is now richer than Mick Jagger and Elton John, Ed Sheeran and Adele. And, to the consternation of her fans, she hasn\u2019t even released an album since 2016. She last did a concert tour the same year.\n\nHer rise to the top of Britain\u2019s elite list appears to have even shocked Robert Watts, who compiles it. \u201cShe somewhat caught us by surprise,\u201d he told the BBC. \u201cVery few people knew she was living in the UK until last summer; now she\u2019s well placed to be the first musician to reach billionaire status in the UK.\u201d\n\nJay-Z and Rihanna, right, in New York in 2005, the year she signed her first record deal with him at Def Jam. Photograph: Brad Barket/Getty Images\n\nRihanna was just 17 when her first single, Pon De Replay, became an unexpected global smash hit. (Her UK label was paying such little attention to its Caribbean signing at the time, it didn\u2019t even bother spelling her name right on their first ever run of \u201cRhianna\u201d CDs).\n\nAt 22, she became the only female artist in the history of the US Billboard chart to score four No 1 singles in a calendar year. By 24, she had won the record as the biggest-selling digital artist of all time, and at 31, Rihanna became the first black woman to run a luxury fashion house. Backed by luxury brand Louis Vuitton Moet Hennessey (LVMH), her fashion brand has been the key to building her staggering wealth. First, with the industry-disrupting launch of Fenty Beauty in 2017, the first cosmetics line to cater for up to 40 skintones, then, with Savage x Fenty, a lingerie line for all sizes.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The success of Rihanna\u2019s fashion brand Fenty has largely fuelled her rise to the top of the rich list. Photograph: Dimitrios Kambouris/Getty Images for Bergdorf Goodman\n\nIt\u2019s a long way from the parish of St Michael, in the south west of Barbados, where Rihanna was born. Her Guyanese mother was an immigrant and her father came from mixed-race heritage, black and white. \u201cThe Guyanese are like the Mexicans of Barbados,\u201d she told British Vogue last month. \u201cThat\u2019s why I really relate and empathise with Latino people who are discriminated against in America.\u201d\n\nRihanna spent her early teenage years training as an army cadet. When she was 14, she formed the girl group Contrast with her friends. That summer, in 2003, the group auditioned for US music producer Evan Richards, who immediately dumped the other girls and set about making Rihanna a solo star. A meeting was arranged with Jay-Z at Def Jam records \u2013 he signed her on the spot.\n\nIn 2007, at 19 and with three albums already under her belt, Rihanna told the Observer: \u201cThey locked me into the office \u2013 til 3am. Then Jay-Z said: \u2018There\u2019s only two ways out: out the door after you sign this deal or through this window.\u2019\u201d Naively, perhaps, she was thrilled by the story. \u201cWe were on the 29th floor,\u201d she said. \u201c[It was] very flattering.\u201d Later, she said she felt stifled by the contract she signed so young, which saw her churn out seven hit albums in seven years.\n\nBut the release of 2007\u2019s Good Girl Gone Bad marked a creative turning point and saw Rihanna drop her label-mandated image which she deemed \u201cgirlie and boring\u201d to experiment with \u201cdifferent, unexpected and edgy\u201d looks. She moved on from reggae-flavoured dancehall and delivered Umbrella, a track that earned her the first of nine Grammys and spent 71 weeks in the UK charts, staying at No 1 for 10 of them.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s now got enough incredible singles to fill five greatest hits albums, and it\u2019s amazing she\u2019s never released one,\u201d says Michael Cragg, music journalist and editor of BEAT magazine. \u201cShe\u2019s got one great album \u2013 Anti \u2013 but like Madonna, she\u2019s made so many good singles it doesn\u2019t matter.\u201d Her ninth album is allegedly imminent, but then it has been for the last year.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rihanna and her then boyfriend Chris Brown on stage in 2008, the year they made their relationship public. The following year Brown, 19, was charged with assaulting her. Photograph: Lucas Jackson/Reuters\n\nWhile, professionally, Rihanna is at her peak, she has faced hardship in her private life. A year after going public about her relationship with RnB singer Chris Brown, photos of her battered face \u2013 swollen and bruised \u2013 were leaked to the press. Brown had beaten her after an argument in the car home from an awards ceremony. The couple broke up, but reconciled several times over the next four years.\n\nIn a 2009 US television interview with Diane Sawyer, Rihanna said that Brown was her \u201cfirst big love\u201d. She had been warned that her reconciliation with him would set a bad example for young girls. \u201cI realise that my selfish decision for love could result in some getting killed,\u201d she said. \u201cEven if Chris never hit me again, who\u2019s to say that [their abusers] won\u2019t kill these girls?\u201d In 2013, back again with Brown, she told Rolling Stone, she didn\u2019t care what people thought : \u201cI decided it was important for me to be happy \u2026 I wasn\u2019t going to let anyone\u2019s opinion get in the way of that.\u201d Months later they broke up again.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Rihanna in the audience at California\u2019s Coachella music festival in 2012.

Designers including Tom Ford and Alexander Wang have been quick to heap praise on her, marking out her daring and constant reinvention. \u201cShe\u2019s an amplified version of what a lot of girls want to look like, but she\u2019s always one step ahead of the game,\u201d designer Peter Dundas told British Vogue.\n\nCritics largely agree it\u2019s a talent that applies to her songs, too. The New Yorker, noting that her limited vocal range has never been the draw, declared in 2016 that her \u201creal art\u201d was \u201cher accessible brand of casual, forward-thinking cool\u201d. Put plainly, Rihanna excels at producing influential pop anthems that reverberate from school discos to underground clubs.\n\nRihanna is notorious for playing against pop machine\u2019s rules and has cultivated a brand \u2013 the \u201cBad Gal Riri\u201d of her Instagram handle \u2013 that is unapologetically sexual. She has her critics: Annie Lennox accused her of peddling \u201cpornographic\u201d music videos, and Mail on Sunday columnist Liz Jones called her \u201ctoxic\u201d and \u201cpoisonous\u201d.\n\n\u201cHer fans lap it up,\u201d says Cragg. \u201cRihanna can be messy, get drunk, have spats on Twitter, sit on the shoulders of her bodyguard at Coachella rolling a blunt, and it\u2019s part of her charm.\n\n\u201cShe\u2019s still got a real edge and you can\u2019t market that or fabricate it in any way. She genuinely has to have really great taste to still be so relevant at this point in her career.\u201d\n\nBy all accounts, Rihanna is supremely slick at what she does \u2013 with little sign that she\u2019s letting up.\n\n\u201cI was always trying to figure out \u2018how can I change the world?

Sometimes more, if I felt like I was wasting away, or less, if my doctor sister had texted me about diabetes again. It wasn\u2019t just gluttony. I write about restaurants. And it wasn\u2019t always the grande bouffe. Sometimes just soup. Sounds defensive, doesn\u2019t it? It looks excessive from our new vantage point.\n\nThat lifestyle came shuddering to a halt at the start of March. Our daughter Lily was born on 11 March. Then the lockdown began. I haven\u2019t been to a restaurant for nearly two months. Other critics have written heartbroken paeans to their former sweethearts. Not me. In fact, the longer the lockdown goes on, the more I wonder whether I miss them at all. The past few weeks have been a crash course in an old-fashioned version of sustenance. We plan meals, shop for ingredients, cook them ourselves. I feed wife, wife feeds daughter, nobody starves, I get to feel useful.\n\nWe are working our way through recipes we\u2019ve been meaning to try.

It should probably be more fraught. But it is a peaceful life, where the choices are basically reduced to \u201cwhat would you like to eat today?\u201d, a vision of a quieter existence that will end soon. I know we are lucky.

Our West Highland terrier, Ziggy, who had travelled the world with us, was rapidly declining.\n\nShe\u2019d beaten the odds three times following the discovery of a mass on her bladder which was finally confirmed as cancer. But in the space of a few months she\u2019d gone from accompanying us on 10km runs to struggling to walk, unable to pee and poo easily, her quality of life rapidly declining.\n\nWe\u2019d decided we wanted to be with her when she was euthanised \u2013 the kindest thing to do, our vet told us \u2013 but by that time in March that service was in short supply.\n\nThe best option we could find was for the procedure to be performed in a quiet part of a vet\u2019s car park in Epping Forest. It felt grim to contemplate. But in the end it was painfully moving, her last moments spent curled up between us as we sat on the ground, her chin resting in my lap.\n\nIt is perhaps why, last week, the television gardener Monty Don\u2019s response to the loss of his own dog Nigel triggered a jolt of recognition. \u201cWhat he had,\u201d said Don, \u201cwas this absolute sense of purity. He exuded an unsullied innocence. We all love our dogs but I\u2019ve had lots of dogs and he was special; it\u2019s very hard to put your finger on it.\u201d\n\nAmid the sadness, these days there is also a feeling of guilt. A sense somehow that \u2013 real as it is \u2013 it is wrong to be feeling grief for a dog at a time when so many others are losing friends and family.\n\nMonty Don with his dogs Nigel and Nell. Photograph: Murdo MacLeod/The Guardian\n\nThe dog thing came late for me. I just about remember our childhood English bull terrier, Fanny, a stage dog my father adopted while he was working in the theatre after she was fired for biting members of the cast of Oliver!\n\nZiggy, though, arrived in my late 40s, and became a firm fixture in our lives, accompanying us everywhere, including on a four-year stint as the Guardian and Observer\u2019s correspondent in Jerusalem.\n\nNow, he was gone. And suddenly we were without a dog.\n\nScientists and psychologists are still edging towards understanding the strange and millennia-old relationship between dogs and humans. On the animals\u2019 side of things, the picture is reasonably clear: the grey wolf, from which all breeds of domesticated dogs descended, already had a highly evolved, sophisticated and social brain. And, as dogs became domesticated, that brain appears to have acquired a sensitivity towards the human gaze and body language that allowed for training.\n\nBut, beyond the developing utilitarian function of dogs, the human draw to make canines their pets has prompted competing explanations.\n\nAs Marta Borgi and Francesca Cirulli of the department of behavioural neuroscience at the Istituto Superiore di Sanit\u00e0 in Rome suggested in a paper in Frontiers in Psychology: \u201cWhy animals constitute such an attractive stimulus for humans has not been completely clarified.\n\n\u201cLiving beings engage the attention of people more than objects do, and it has been hypothesised that the evolutionary reason behind this response is that paying attention to other living beings is significant for individual fitness.\u201d\n\nOther theories have been posited. One suggests that we feel a greater attraction to species that are closer to us on the genetic family tree or that are similar in behavioural or cognitive ways.\n\nThen there is the long-established notion of Kindchenschema or \u201cbaby schema\u201d, which suggests humans are attracted specifically to animals that display \u201ccute\u201d or infantile features with a large head and obvious eyes, although recent MRI studies of brain activation patterns in women viewing facial images of their own child and own dog suggested different responses.\n\nAnd while many of those specialising in the field have sought to avoid the use of the word \u201cfriendship\u201d in response to animal-human relationships, Borgi and Cirulli embrace it.\n\n\u201cIn our opinion \u2018friendship\u2019 appears to be the most suitable word to describe close human-pet relationships, which imply the formation of a social bond that serves analogous emotional and adaptive functions as human-human friendships,\u201d they write.\n\n\u2018Friendship\u2019 appears to be the most suitable word to describe close human-pet relationships Marta Borgi and Francesca Cirulli\n\n\u201cMost of the properties that a relationship should have in order to be characterised as friendship are traceable in the human-pet association: intimacy, companionship, trust, loyalty, commitment, affection, acceptance, sympathy, concern for the other\u2019s welfare, as well as time spent together and maintenance of the pair bond after long separations.\u201d\n\nPerhaps, as the Pulitzer-winning poet Mary Oliver wrote in Dog Talk, the end piece essay for the collection Dog Songs, some of the attachment relates to the way in which canines occupy a middle space between the wild and the tame worlds, interpreting that other place for us.\n\n\u201cSome things are unchangeably wild, others stolidly tame \u2026 There are wild things that have been altered, but only into a semblance of tameness, it is no real change. But the dog lives in both worlds.\u201d\n\nBut it is Don\u2019s comment about \u201cunsullied innocence\u201d that resonates the most with me. After Ziggy\u2019s death a friend suggested that what we see in our dogs are \u201chairy little saints\u201d. And in a time of such uncertainty, our social bonds disrupted, it is perhaps this that people are seeking.\n\nLast week a new dog arrived in our lives. Mindful of the \u201chairy saint\u201d description we\u2019ve called him Bodhi, meaning \u201cawakened,\u201d although into what dog world we\u2019ll never know. It is always an emotional contract, entered into, as Oliver puts it, in the knowledge of our dogs\u2019 brief time on earth.\n\n\u201cIt is exceedingly short, his galloping life. Dogs die so soon \u2026 We would do anything to keep them with us, and to keep them young.

In Dortmund Erling Haaland scored the first goal of football\u2019s plague times and stood by the corner flag with his teammates around him in a celebratory pastiche of social distancing, a strangely haunting image that will, you suspect, be recycled many times.\n\nWelcome to the new abnormal normal. Which is, needless to say, a fairly strange place to be. And yet for all the oddity of its staging, something did seem to shift over the 90 minutes of Borussia Dortmund\u2019s 4-0 defeat of Schalke at Signal Iduna Park, one of six comeback fixtures to take place in the Bundesliga, two months since football \u2013 and that rather less urgent entity, the world \u2013 went into standby mode.\n\nThere was encouragement here for the industry. By the end it wasn\u2019t too hard to see how televised football might re-emerge as a functioning entity. No spitting. No hugging. No fans. No noise beyond the constant muffled echo of managerial shrieking, like the sound of somebody being water-boarded in the flat upstairs.\n\nHaaland leads the way as Dortmund win by a distance on Bundesliga return Read more\n\nBut still, it worked after a fashion. There were early moments of double-take. No doubt the sight of players arriving in protective gear on sparsely occupied buses will become commonplace in time.\n\nThere was the deeply weird sight of the masked subs spread in a line in their large leather touchline seats, a row of ejected fighter pilots. Both sets of players grinned and shrugged as they warmed up in front of empty stands. At one point Haaland burst out laughing.\n\nSignal Iduna Park was a poignant venue in this respect, a ground that is as much as any in Europe an emblem of the importance of here and now and being present. This is an unshowy footballing giant, lodged in the leafy flatlands of the Ruhr and circled by low-lying industrial hubs. On match days the walkways are crammed with sausage stalls and beer taps. This is the essence of Dortmund, the place where the club\u2019s heart is located. They had 81,365 in here for the last home game, in February. The contrast in the opening seconds was stark. Why are we actually playing, you kept wondering as the ball was passed around with a forced sense of urgency and Dortmund in particular seemed to be playing through a laudanum haze.\n\nThere is, of course, a note of weirdness in the basic idea of football as our first shared step to normality. There\u2019s a famous Dave Chapelle joke about MTV broadcasting the views of the rapper Ja Rule shortly after the Word Trade Centre was taken down. As Chapelle points out: \u201cI want some answers that Ja Rule might not have right now.\u201d Perhaps there are those among us who felt all along that one day Steve McManaman would be the voice to guide our first tentative steps out of a global pandemic. But then football was always likely to jostle its way to the front of this queue, to plonk its tankard down on the bar for first helpings.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Schalke\u2019s players enter the stadium. Photograph: Martin Meissner/EPA\n\nAnd it must be said BT Sport\u2019s pared-back team did a fine job with a deeply odd occasion. James Richardson, ruggedly nautical in greying lockdown beard, looked absolutely delighted to be anchoring the show. His chief pundit Rafael Honigstein\u2019s usual air of ironic distances was only enhanced by the vast expanse of desk between them.\n\nOn commentary Paul Dempsey worked hard, and successfully, to bridge the oddity on the pitch, although it was touch and go at first. The ball was passed in silence. There was a foul and nobody howled or screamed. Was this the promised end, the final word on football as metaphor for the emptiness of modern life , the futility of consumer culture? Perhaps not.\n\nSteadily the day began to move, the old muscle memory kicking in. Football began to happen.\n\nChanges will no doubt be made. The games will need something to cover the empty seats and also some kind of soundtrack. Not music, that would be awful. Perhaps just a kind of monotone noise-cancelling drone that blocks out all sense of sound from your brain. Is Mark Lawrenson even available?\n\nHaaland scored with 29 minutes gone, the absence of a crowd offering the bonus of a lovely \u201cching\u201d noise as the ball hit the pole in the side of the net. And Dortmund ran the rest of the game. The final minutes were a kind of zombie game, played out by some tired athletes on both sides.\n\nEmpty seats and elbow bumps as Bundesliga makes clinical return Read more\n\nNo matter, though. The key elements are back. Television schedules will be filled. The rolling advert boards are fired up once more. Evonik\u2019s pitch-side awning is visible to the world, for all the good it\u2019s going to do them. And no doubt the Premier League, fearful of losing market share, will now look to accelerate its own return.\n\nBefore then it must be said that Germany has earned this, has earned the right to be first, to stand alone, crowd-less, staging football. The Bundesliga isn\u2019t declaring this health crisis to be over. It is instead declaring its own government\u2019s relative competence in the early months of this crisis, the mass testing that means football\u2019s own demands \u2013 testing through the whole process for all players and officials \u2013 makes it part of the wider culture rather than a special case.\n\nIn Britain the approach has been woollier, to the extent the Premier League would be a most unwelcome guest in the middle of this loss of control.

But it also lays out the principles of how a bio-secure venue may operate on match day.\n\nQuick guide The key principles of England's plan Show Hide Zones\n\nThe cricket grounds used this summer \u2013 expected to be the Ageas Bowl and Old Trafford because of their on-site hotels \u2013 will be divided up into areas and movement between them strictly limited. A one-way system of paths will be set up around the ground. Functional areas This is a group of staff \u2013 for example players or broadcasters \u2013 who are clearly defined and must operate solely within their designated zones. Some zones may be required to have more than one functional area working in it at the same time, such as players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match, but they cannot interact. Contact clusters\n\n\n\nIndividuals within a functional area can form their own exclusive social pod that, provided everyone involved commits to remaining socially distant from outsiders, allows them to relax in each other\u2019s company. All three concepts are designed to minimise the number of interactions an individual makes and reduces the risk of transmission in the event of an outbreak.\n\nAfter phase two, where training is permitted to take place in small groups, players and support staff from both sides would enter an \u201cisland site\u201d \u2013 a cricket ground with a hotel \u2013 for phase three and, following initial testing for coronavirus, they will then live and train on site but only within strictly designated zones.\n\n\n\nAshley Giles, England\u2019s cricket director, has confirmed they are looking at ways England\u2019s players can leave and re-enter the so-called \u201cbubble\u201d given a block of nine weeks away from friends and family that covers preparation time, practice games and the six proposed Tests, starting at Hampshire\u2019s Ageas Bowl on 8 July.\n\nHowever when the squad is together in the ground and part of a regular testing and screening programme it forms a \u201cfunctional area\u201d, one of a number of separate personnel groups that also include venue staff, the ECB events team, groundstaff, broadcasters/media and match officials within an overall headcount of around 300.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The hotel at the Ageas Bowl is set to form part of the\n\nbio-secure environment that players will enter. Photograph: Alex Davidson/Getty Images\n\nThese FAs must each stick to their designated zones within the hotel and stadium and though two such groups may find themselves down to operate in the same zone at times \u2013 for example players and ground staff on the outfield before the start of a match \u2013 contact between them must be kept to an absolute minimum.\n\nThe system is designed to create clearly defined distance between FAs and, in theory, prevent the spread of Covid-19 should it penetrate the ground. Perhaps the most intriguing element of the plan is the concept of \u201ccontact clusters\u201d, where individuals within an FA group can create their own exclusive sub-group.\n\nThe principle here is that individuals within a \u201ccontact cluster\u201d avoid anything but essential contact with those outside of it and so can be more comfortable within what is called \u201ca circle of trust\u201d. How this applies to the social dynamics of two playing squads that will both be up to 30 cricketers-strong remains to be seen.\n\nSchematics for the grounds detail the various zones and there will be signposted one-way systems to navigate on foot. Personnel will also be urged to sanitise hands at entry points to communal areas and use alternative methods of communication, such as telephone calls or video conferencing, where possible.\n\nWhile the introductory document states an intention to create isolation areas for individuals who become ill, as well as exit strategies and contact tracing, a full medical protocol for how a possible outbreak may be tackled has not yet been shared and will be crucial to receiving sign-off from the government.\n\n\n\nEngland\u2019s players have had a number of the details above explained to them already \u2013 one told the Observer it was \u201cmind-blowing\u201d \u2013 but much will hinge on convincing West Indies, the first set of tourists, they will be safe to leave the relatively untouched Caribbean to fly to one of the pandemic\u2019s hotspots.\n\n\n\nGiles has already admitted the plans have a number of \u201cpinch points\u201d that need fully ironing out before they can be put back to the government, while the International Cricket Council is yet to rule on whether players who have passed testing can still apply saliva to the ball and, if not, permit some form of legalised ball tampering.\n\nThe bill for creating these bio-secure venues and flying two touring teams into the country on charter flights will run well into seven figures and the proposed tours will ultimately hinge on how the national picture looks in the coming weeks as lockdown measures in the UK begin to be relaxed.\n\nWith the ECB facing losses of \u00a3380m in the event of no cricket being staged this summer \u2013 and six Tests worth an estimated \u00a3120m in broadcast revenues \u2013 the governing body is throwing every possible resource at getting international cricket back on television.", "author": ["Ali Martin"]}, {"link": "https://www.theguardian.com/football/blog/2020/may/16/premier-league-return-coronavirus-lockdown", "published": "2020-05-16T20:00:38", "title": "Football has always adapted to hard times.

Yet within two months, regional leagues had been established. Arsenal, for instance, hammered Sunderland 5-2 on 2 September and then beat Charlton 8-4 in their inaugural southern league fixture on 21 October. It is difficult to be sure of attendances, but in excess of 10,000 turned up for both their games against West Ham.\n\nThe War Cup final on 8 June 1940 \u2013 which kicked off at 6.30pm despite fears of bombing raids \u2013 drew 42,300 to Wembley, the restrictions on public gatherings long since lifted. The remarkable aspect of football in the second world war is how much of it there was. In Germany, they kept playing until the end of April 1945. In France, war champions were declared each year, although the 1943-44 season was incomplete. The Netherlands missed only one season, Italy two.\n\nHungary was invaded twice, first by the Germans and then by the Soviets, and yet football never stopped. At times the juxtaposition of detail becomes absurd. On 6 December 1944, with Nazi-occupied Budapest under bombardment from the Red Army, the Ujpest coach, Geza Kertesz, who was working with a resistance group that had been supplying details on troop movements to the United States, took a training session then held a press conference previewing the upcoming derby against Ferencvaros. That evening he was arrested by local fascists and handed over to the Gestapo; two months later he was executed as the Germans prepared to retreat.\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest The 1940 War Cup final, won 1-0 by West Ham against Blackburn at Wembley.

It adapts to circumstance and carries on, whether that means rejigging competitions and regulations, guest players or limited crowds. Second, and perhaps more pertinently, there has always been a demand for it, from both authorities and fans.\n\nAfter the German invasion of Ukraine, a league was quickly established as part of a process of \u201cnormalisation\u201d \u2013 which is what led ultimately to the \u201cdeath match\u201d between Start, a bakery side that featured a number of former Dynamo Kyiv players, and a team representing the Luftwaffe. The logic that encouraged the Hungarian authorities to keep football going is the same that led the British government to waive the restrictions on crowds so people could still gather to watch football. And that is the impact football has on morale.\n\nThis is not something to be treated glibly \u2013 and there is an obvious difference with wartime in the risk of the virus being transmitted by the act of playing. Danny Rose is right to fear players being forced back prematurely. But just because Dominic Raab says something doesn\u2019t necessarily make it superficial nonsense; it can also be glib for amateur virologists to dismiss out of hand the attempt to create a safe environment for football.\n\nPremier League's Covid-19 code of conduct form explained | David Hytner Read more\n\nThere was much discussion of a poll last week that suggested 73% of people did not anticipate their morale being lifted by the return of football. But 19% did, which seemed even more remarkable: one in five people \u2013 13 million Britons \u2013 think they will be happier with football to watch and, perhaps more important, discuss.\n\nIt may be that any football that is played ends up being tepid, that the sense of artificiality is overpowering, the absence of fans a huge turn-off. Once Liverpool have sealed their Premier League title, how engaging will the battle against relegation or for qualification to the Champions League be, particularly when it\u2019s far from clear if or in what form next season\u2019s Champions League will take place? On the other hand, the FA Cup may find itself reinvigorated.\n\nAnd, of course, the how is hugely complex. But if the infection rate falls, if the resources are available and if a safe environment can be created, then why would football not be considering a resumption? Every other industry is assessing how to restart as lockdown begins to ease: why not football?\n\nFacebook Twitter Pinterest Newcastle\u2019s Danny Rose (left) is among the top-flight players to express concerns about a restart. Photograph: James Marsh/BPI/Shutterstock\n\nThe Bundesliga\u2019s return is a huge test. Borussia Dortmund\u2019s managing director, Carsten Cramer, has said the protocols to protect players went far beyond the safety measures in most other industries. There\u2019s no reason for the Premier League not to match those standards. But Cramer also noted that, on top of the human cost, \u201cif we fail, the problems afterwards [for football] will be even bigger than before\u201d.\n\nFootball was right to stop when it did but it\u2019s right for it to consider when and how it may return. Judging precisely when the risk has been sufficiently minimised is clearly enormously difficult, there is every reason for extreme caution, and players need to be fully involved in the process, but that doesn\u2019t mean the assessment should be shirked. If the necessary threshold of safety can be achieved, the palliative effect of resumption is potentially huge. This is not just about the game or money.\n\nSign up to The Recap, our weekly email of editors\u2019 picks.\n\nCS Lewis observed that literature exists to remind us we are not alone. Football fulfils a similar function. It is the currency in which a vast amount of social interaction is conducted. Governments recognised that in times of crisis throughout the 20th century but football has never been bigger than it is now. After weeks of isolation, there has perhaps never been a time when it has been more important to remember we are not alone.

Liverpool reopened Melwood for individual training on 7 May and, despite the uncertainty over the return date, Klopp has no doubts over his players\u2019 preparation.\n\nAsked on BBC\u2019s Football Focus whether his players will be ready to start, the Liverpool manager said: \u201cYes.

An adult panda will consume up to 38 kilograms, or about 84 pounds, of bamboo a day.\n\nThe zoo\u2019s president, Clement Lanthier, told The Associated Press on Thursday that the facility spent months trying to overcome transportation barriers in acquiring fresh bamboo during the global pandemic. Bamboo is rare in Canada and Er Shun and Da Mao prefer only certain kinds.\n\n\u201cThey are picky,\u201d Lanthier said. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why they are endangered. They need their bamboo. That\u2019s all they do. They eat bamboo and they sleep.\u201d\n\nTransporting bamboo from California added even more frustration to the process.

As of Saturday, the confirmed death toll from the pandemic in the U.S. topped 87,000 people.\n\nNursing home neglect is a tragic but common occurrence in our country. Although elder abuse can happen from in-home care as well, it all too often occurs when caregivers feel overworked and exhausted.\n\nSince reports of negligent and substandard care at any nursing homes across the country show this is a serious problem, this may be the time for Congress to consider the importance of adequate staffing and compensation for long-term care facility employees \u2013 as well as transitioning some of our elderly and disabled to in-home care settings.\n\nPolicy implications moving forward must pay significant attention to infections in assisted-living facilities, especially focusing on staff who work at multiple sites, patients coming directly from the hospital and visitors to the facilities.\n\nAs I discuss in my book, \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d while our medical advancements have provided us with a longer lifespan, many elderly Americans are living with diseases and medical conditions that make them especially susceptible to the most severe effects of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur increased longevity is one of the greatest medical achievements of the modern era,\u201d I wrote in my book. \u201cOn average, Americans today can expect to live nearly thirty years longer than did our predecessors at the turn of the twentieth century\u2026. As medical advancements continue to improve health, and more baby boomers enter their retirement years, the demand for long-term medical services is growing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, nearly 5.7 million people in the U.S. are living with dementia. Similar to the global trends, these numbers are expected to rise as life expectancy increases.\n\nAdditionally, almost all recipients of Medicare with dementia (95 percent) have at least one other preexisting chronic health condition. And because of their impaired memory and reasoning ability, people living with dementia cannot solely manage or direct their own care. This requires them to live with a caregiver or in an assisted-living facility.\n\nAccording to Robert Egge, chief public policy office of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association: \u201cWhile there is a significant number of priority actions to take during a global pandemic like this, it has been increasingly clear that nursing homes and other long-term care communities are \u2018hot spots\u2019 for COVID-19. And their residents with dementia are particularly susceptible due to their age, their increased likelihood of coexisting chronic conditions, and the community nature of these settings. These issues have likely been overlooked due to an inability to access the necessary testing and inaccurate reporting. There is an urgent need, and there has been for some time, to address the disproportionate vulnerability of this population.\u201d\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association is urging policymakers to implement new policy solutions that will address the immediate and long-term issues impacting care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\nTesting\n\nEach nursing home and assisted living community should have the onsite capability to verify that all residents, staff and visitors are free of COVID-19 infection, whether or not they are symptomatic.\n\nAccess to testing should be the \u201cWhite House Standard,\u201d where staff members are tested frequently. Government support is needed to ensure accelerated production and delivery of testing material to nursing homes, with rapid turnaround testing staffed by trained personnel.\n\nReporting\n\nAll cases of COVID-19 at nursing homes and assisted living communities need to be reported immediately and accurately.\n\nAdditionally, these reports should be updated upon remission, death, transfer or other appropriate status update. With all appropriate privacy safeguards for individuals, this reported data should be freely and immediately accessible to all, down to the facility level.\n\nSurge Activation\n\nAs \u201chot spots\u201d occur, they must be dealt with urgently and effectively. Any reported cases should trigger careful, ongoing monitoring. If conditions warrant, \u201cstrike teams\u201d should be employed to a facility to provide needed support until the outbreak is appropriately contained and eliminated.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n\nAll nursing homes and assisted living communities should have full access to all needed PPE, testing equipment, training and external support to keep them COVID-19 free.\n\nSharply increased unemployment and other economic fallout caused by measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 are taking an increasing toll on the mental and financial health of the American people.\n\nAlmost all states around the nation are at least partially lifting stay-at-home orders and restrictions on businesses because officials realize we can\u2019t continue to keep our country locked down for months or perhaps even years while we await the availability of a coronavirus vaccine and effective treatments for COVID-19.\n\nAs a result, state and federal officials must ensure that measures are in place to protect the most vulnerable people in our country while we reopen.\n\nAs the statistics on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes make clear, the risk of death from this new disease is not spread evenly across our population.\n\nSome 94 percent of our nation\u2019s workforce is under age 55, and those without serious medical conditions are at far lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than are elderly Americans. In addition, children having the lowest severity profile of COVID-19 deaths.\n\nSo it makes sense that if we can focus on protecting the most vulnerable among us, our country can regain a level of normalcy while carefully reopening.\n\nA crucial mission will be to limit asymptomatic spread amongst the elderly, near-elderly and those with preexisting conditions. There is little doubt that even under the best of circumstances, when stay-at-home orders are loosened (as they should be), there will be increased COVID-19 cases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat\u2019s important is whether we are capable of identifying and reporting new cases and decreasing the amount of virus transmission.\n\nThe good news is that officials at every level of government have the information to strategically reopen our country by acknowledging the fact that the elderly and the near-elderly who also have other chronic diseases are at the greatest risk of deaths and severe illness caused by COVID-19.\n\nThe key to moving forward is ensuring that nursing homes and assisted-care facilities have adequate PPE supplies, universal access to perform enhanced surveillance and point-of-care testing, reporting measures in place, and protocols listed for new COVID-19 case surges.\n\nAdditionally, as \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in the home setting are reported, ensuring the safety of the most vulnerable Americans being cared for at home would only be feasible if caregivers were provided the necessary resources to care for their family members at home.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInvesting more resources so that nursing homes are better-positioned to respond to and contain virus outbreaks won\u2019t eliminate the threat posed by COVID-19 and other viral diseases, but it could significantly reduce the death toll of these diseases.\n\nIf the coronavirus pandemic results in increased safety and hygiene measures throughout our nation\u2019s nursing homes \u2013 and increased home-care resources for our elderly and disabled with the closure of facilities providing substandard care \u2013 we will be able to save lives and be better prepared to deal with viral diseases far into the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DR.

As of Saturday, the confirmed death toll from the pandemic in the U.S. topped 87,000 people.\n\nNursing home neglect is a tragic but common occurrence in our country. Although elder abuse can happen from in-home care as well, it all too often occurs when caregivers feel overworked and exhausted.\n\nSince reports of negligent and substandard care at any nursing homes across the country show this is a serious problem, this may be the time for Congress to consider the importance of adequate staffing and compensation for long-term care facility employees \u2013 as well as transitioning some of our elderly and disabled to in-home care settings.\n\nPolicy implications moving forward must pay significant attention to infections in assisted-living facilities, especially focusing on staff who work at multiple sites, patients coming directly from the hospital and visitors to the facilities.\n\nAs I discuss in my book, \u201cMake America Healthy Again,\u201d while our medical advancements have provided us with a longer lifespan, many elderly Americans are living with diseases and medical conditions that make them especially susceptible to the most severe effects of COVID-19.\n\n\u201cOur increased longevity is one of the greatest medical achievements of the modern era,\u201d I wrote in my book. \u201cOn average, Americans today can expect to live nearly thirty years longer than did our predecessors at the turn of the twentieth century\u2026. As medical advancements continue to improve health, and more baby boomers enter their retirement years, the demand for long-term medical services is growing.\u201d\n\nAccording to the Alzheimer\u2019s Association, nearly 5.7 million people in the U.S. are living with dementia. Similar to the global trends, these numbers are expected to rise as life expectancy increases.\n\nAdditionally, almost all recipients of Medicare with dementia (95 percent) have at least one other preexisting chronic health condition. And because of their impaired memory and reasoning ability, people living with dementia cannot solely manage or direct their own care. This requires them to live with a caregiver or in an assisted-living facility.\n\nAccording to Robert Egge, chief public policy office of the Alzheimer\u2019s Association: \u201cWhile there is a significant number of priority actions to take during a global pandemic like this, it has been increasingly clear that nursing homes and other long-term care communities are \u2018hot spots\u2019 for COVID-19. And their residents with dementia are particularly susceptible due to their age, their increased likelihood of coexisting chronic conditions, and the community nature of these settings. These issues have likely been overlooked due to an inability to access the necessary testing and inaccurate reporting. There is an urgent need, and there has been for some time, to address the disproportionate vulnerability of this population.\u201d\n\nThe Alzheimer\u2019s Association is urging policymakers to implement new policy solutions that will address the immediate and long-term issues impacting care facilities during the COVID-19 pandemic, including:\n\nTesting\n\nEach nursing home and assisted living community should have the onsite capability to verify that all residents, staff and visitors are free of COVID-19 infection, whether or not they are symptomatic.\n\nAccess to testing should be the \u201cWhite House Standard,\u201d where staff members are tested frequently. Government support is needed to ensure accelerated production and delivery of testing material to nursing homes, with rapid turnaround testing staffed by trained personnel.\n\nReporting\n\nAll cases of COVID-19 at nursing homes and assisted living communities need to be reported immediately and accurately.\n\nAdditionally, these reports should be updated upon remission, death, transfer or other appropriate status update. With all appropriate privacy safeguards for individuals, this reported data should be freely and immediately accessible to all, down to the facility level.\n\nSurge Activation\n\nAs \u201chot spots\u201d occur, they must be dealt with urgently and effectively. Any reported cases should trigger careful, ongoing monitoring. If conditions warrant, \u201cstrike teams\u201d should be employed to a facility to provide needed support until the outbreak is appropriately contained and eliminated.\n\nPersonal Protective Equipment (PPE)\n\nAll nursing homes and assisted living communities should have full access to all needed PPE, testing equipment, training and external support to keep them COVID-19 free.\n\nSharply increased unemployment and other economic fallout caused by measures to slow the spread of COVID-19 are taking an increasing toll on the mental and financial health of the American people.\n\nAlmost all states around the nation are at least partially lifting stay-at-home orders and restrictions on businesses because officials realize we can\u2019t continue to keep our country locked down for months or perhaps even years while we await the availability of a coronavirus vaccine and effective treatments for COVID-19.\n\nAs a result, state and federal officials must ensure that measures are in place to protect the most vulnerable people in our country while we reopen.\n\nAs the statistics on COVID-19 deaths in nursing homes make clear, the risk of death from this new disease is not spread evenly across our population.\n\nSome 94 percent of our nation\u2019s workforce is under age 55, and those without serious medical conditions are at far lower risk of dying from COVID-19 than are elderly Americans. In addition, children having the lowest severity profile of COVID-19 deaths.\n\nSo it makes sense that if we can focus on protecting the most vulnerable among us, our country can regain a level of normalcy while carefully reopening.\n\nA crucial mission will be to limit asymptomatic spread amongst the elderly, near-elderly and those with preexisting conditions. There is little doubt that even under the best of circumstances, when stay-at-home orders are loosened (as they should be), there will be increased COVID-19 cases.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWhat\u2019s important is whether we are capable of identifying and reporting new cases and decreasing the amount of virus transmission.\n\nThe good news is that officials at every level of government have the information to strategically reopen our country by acknowledging the fact that the elderly and the near-elderly who also have other chronic diseases are at the greatest risk of deaths and severe illness caused by COVID-19.\n\nThe key to moving forward is ensuring that nursing homes and assisted-care facilities have adequate PPE supplies, universal access to perform enhanced surveillance and point-of-care testing, reporting measures in place, and protocols listed for new COVID-19 case surges.\n\nAdditionally, as \u201cexcess deaths\u201d in the home setting are reported, ensuring the safety of the most vulnerable Americans being cared for at home would only be feasible if caregivers were provided the necessary resources to care for their family members at home.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nInvesting more resources so that nursing homes are better-positioned to respond to and contain virus outbreaks won\u2019t eliminate the threat posed by COVID-19 and other viral diseases, but it could significantly reduce the death toll of these diseases.\n\nIf the coronavirus pandemic results in increased safety and hygiene measures throughout our nation\u2019s nursing homes \u2013 and increased home-care resources for our elderly and disabled with the closure of facilities providing substandard care \u2013 we will be able to save lives and be better prepared to deal with viral diseases far into the future.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DR.

This was in response to a March 16 public health order seeking to free up as many hospital beds as possible to handle the expected high volume of COVID patients.\n\nIn addition to governors and hospitals, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the U.S. surgeon general and many medical organizations such as the American College of Surgeons and the American Society of Anesthesiologists recommended interim cancellation of elective surgical procedures. Physicians and health care organizations across the country responded appropriately and canceled nonessential cases.\n\nAs most of you know, I am married to an orthopedic surgeon and approximately 90 percent of his surgical cases are elective. These are things such as rotator cuff tears, meniscus tears and ACL\u2019s that need to be reconstructed.\n\nROBERT O'BRIEN: VENTILATORS FOR CORONAVIRUS \u2014 US IS ARSENAL OF HEALTH IN WAR ON COVID-19\n\nI remember my husband calling his patients and telling them that because their surgeries were elective, but not urgent and deemed essential, they had to be postponed due to the pandemic. Although the patients fully understood, that didn\u2019t take away their pain or their worry.\n\nMany states are starting to reopen nonessential businesses, a sign that restrictions caused by the COVID-19 pandemic are slowly easing. In California, where I live, we are now allowed to return to the beaches (with some restrictions) and pick up merchandise bought online from some retailers curbside.\n\nIn many other states, hospitals are making plans again to allow elective surgeries to be performed. California Gov. Gavin Newsom cleared the way this week for hospitals throughout the state to resume some discretionary surgeries. He urged providers to work together to ensure that resuming non-urgent services \u201cdoesn\u2019t affect their abilities to respond to any surges of COVID patients.\u201d\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nI agree with the governor and with those doctors and hospitals who feel it\u2019s time to move forward with elective procedures. And I say this for a few reasons:\n\nThis public health order was put in place so personal protective equipment would not be taken from those treating COVID-19 patients and hospital beds wouldn\u2019t be limited. As the first wave of this pandemic is hopefully going to be behind us soon (depending on where you live), the pent-up patient demand for surgical and procedural case is going to be immense. And the medical community can show that it is prepared to meet this demand.\n\nPatients are in pain and if they are not operated on within a certain time frame, their conditions are likely to worsen. Doctors have taken an oath to do no harm and these procedures simply cannot be delayed indefinitely.\n\nElective surgeries make up a substantial portion of hospital revenue and, as a result of COVID-19 and not scheduling these elective cases, hospital revenues have flatlined.\n\nHealth care represents approximately 18 percent of the GDP, so any financial improvements in the health sector can quickly help to stabilize state and national economies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe bottom line is many hospitals have the beds and supplies to accommodate both the patients and the staff. Conversations with hospital operators throughout the nation convened earlier this week show many are ready to move forward. The doctors are ready and patients want their pain or their situation to be changed or improved.\n\nIf we are concerned about our nation\u2019s health both physically and financially, and if all conditions are met by hospitals and the health care providers, it is time to take a step forward and allow our nation\u2019s physicians to do what they were trained to do.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY LESLIE MARSHALL", "author": ["Leslie Marshall", "Leslie Marshall Joined Fox News Channel As A Contributor In", "Providing Analysis On Both Political", "Social Issues A Liberal Point Of View.

BUT THEY ONLY CARE ABOUT POWER\n\nPresident Trump's critics imply that the draft guidelines were too rigorous and the president is making safety a low priority.\n\nNonsense.\n\nThe real problems with the draft guidelines were that they took a one-size-fits-all approach despite the huge differences between rural counties and dense cities like New York and that they were outdated.\n\nThey could have been written 50 years ago, ignoring technologies available now that can control the spread of disease and make returning to work or school safer. The final guidelines are shorter, but still a half-century behind the times.\n\nAgency guidelines for schools and offices, for example, recommend placing desks six feet apart and encouraging frequent hand hygiene.\n\nFine, but the agency should also be informing employers and school administrators of the many other tools available. They could upgrade to antimicrobial surfaces, including doorknobs, computer keyboards, handrails and other frequently touched surfaces.\n\nNumerous studies show how viral traces deposited on a doorknob can be spread by touch, infecting many people in just a few hours.\n\nCopper naturally destroys viruses and bacteria. Several manufacturers produce molded polymer products embedded with copper, including desktops, keyboards and chair arms.\n\nAntimicrobial coatings can also be painted on existing floors, furniture and equipment. All of these high-tech approaches are already used in hospitals. Now is the time to inform the public about their usefulness in combatting the coronavirus.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe CDC also recommends that schools, offices and other venues open windows and doors to increase air circulation.\n\nResearch finds that air conditioning can spread viral droplets from an infected person to other people across the room, depending on the direction of the airflow. Bringing in fresh air is better.\n\nMakes sense, but opening the windows is not always an option. The agency should at least mention that there are more effective options available, including continuous, nontoxic disinfection devices that can be installed in the HVAC system.\n\nThese technologies are already used by professional sports teams in their locker rooms, and by manufacturers and hospitals. They deactivate viruses in the air and reduce traces of virus or bacteria on surfaces.\n\nThe side benefit is a healthier workforce and lower absenteeism even if the coronavirus fades soon.\n\nThe CDC guidelines never once mention public restrooms. But reducing the risk of viral spread when toilets are flushed is important. The key is to be sure all toilets have lids.\n\nResearch indicates that coronavirus is carried in feces. When a toilet is flushed, the virus can become aerosolized. New findings in the journal Emerging Infectious Diseases suggest the virus is found in heavy concentrations in restrooms.\n\nPresident Trump has built a huge force of private sector companies to help with ventilators, masks, therapeutics and hopefully vaccines.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAt his press conferences, he stresses the importance of private sector innovation and capacity to beat the coronavirus.

It is administered by Israel, and contains several clearly defined Israeli population centers, most of which are contiguous to Israel.\n\nBut while European nations are quick to criticize Israel, they are passive about the real threats to stability in the region.\n\nJust last week, Mohsen Rezaei of Iran\u2019s Expediency Council threatened to \u201craze Israeli cities to the ground\u201d even in the event there is a U.S. response to Iranian attacks against American forces in Iraq.\n\nThese threats \u2013 to destroy Israeli cities filled with civilians and wipe out \u201cthe Zionist entity\u201d and the \u201cZionist cancer\u201d \u2013 are made on a regular basis by leading Iranian officials like Rezaei. The response in Europe to such genocidal rhetoric is essentially a collective yawn.\n\nIt reminds one of similar language used by the Palestine Liberation Organization in the years when it was hijacking airliners, attacking synagogues in Rome and Antwerp, planting bombs in buses in Israeli cities, and calling for Israel\u2019s destruction. At the time, much of this was dismissed by European governments as \u201cIsrael\u2019s problem,\u201d or minimized as just being for \u201chome (Palestinian) consumption.\u201d\n\nIn other words, don\u2019t take it seriously. That, while Iran continues its malign presence in Syria, attacks American bases in Iraq, re-stocks the arms depots of the terrorist group Hezbollah, counts the terrorist group Hamas as a willing ally, sends a military satellite into space, and marches on in its ultimate goal of developing nuclear weapons.\n\nIndeed, most European states are still not sure whether or not to call the nuclear deal with Iran \u2013 the JCPOA (Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action) \u2013 a failed enterprise, even while Iranian efforts to dominate the Middle East proceed apace.\n\nAnd yet, Europe always has time to express bias against Israel.\n\nPronouncements out of Brussels from the European Union\u2019s top foreign policy chief, Joseph Borrell, called annexation by Israel \u201ca serious violation of international law\u201d and said the EU \u201cwill act accordingly.\u201d\n\nSimilar warnings have come from Paris, Berlin and other capitals. Threats of imposing sanctions on Israel and the recall of ambassadors are being made, all in the name of protecting a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\nEurope\u2019s admonitions against Israel ring hollow.\n\nSince the-then European Economic Community (the forerunner of the EU) 1980 Venice Declaration that endorsed Palestinian self-government, Europe has been largely supportive of the Palestinian narrative to the conflict.\n\nWhen the EU has imposed discipline of voting at the United Nations, member states often abstain on Israeli-Palestinian issues, which to the Palestinian camp is seen as wavering support in Europe for Israel.\n\nEurope\u2019s admonitions against Israel ring hollow.\n\nWhen left to vote on their own, some European countries have voted with the Palestinian side on issues concerning Jerusalem, for example, at UNESCO or even at the World Health Organization.\n\nThere is also an interesting breakdown when no EU bloc voting is imposed at the U.N. Most countries in Central and Eastern Europe are more inclined to be supportive of Israel. But instances of such \u201copen voting\u201d are few and far between.\n\nIf Europe wanted to be helpful it would have been pushing the Palestinians from the time of the 1993 Oslo accords to resolve their conflict with Israel by going to the negotiating table and making reasonable and reciprocal compromises with the Jewish state.\n\nIt has been repeated often, but bears saying again: opportunities for the Palestinians to make a deal have been presented numerous times over many years \u2013 at Camp David, after Israel\u2019s withdrawal from Gaza, at Annapolis and with then-Secretary of State John Kerry\u2019s initiative. But the Palestinians have always walked away, because making peace would require their taking less than the zero-sum result they have been promising their people.\n\nThe Europeans know full well \u2013 as the Palestinians certainly do \u2013 that the Israeli population blocs close-in to Israel will not be relinquished in any negotiated settlement. This became clear during the Annapolis conference in 2008 and at all attempts at talks since then. And even if annexation were to occur, that would not preclude the formation of a Palestinian state at some point in the future.\n\nFor the past almost four years, the Palestinian Authority has given a cold shoulder to the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to get peace negotiations with Israel started, and then shut down completely on Trump\u2019s \u201cdeal of the century\u201d peace plan.\n\nThe Palestinian Authority made it clear that it would simply wait out the Trump administration. The old line that \u201cthe Palestinians never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity\u201d has never rung truer.\n\nIn the meantime, the world has moved on. Iranian aggression in Iraq, Syria, Lebanon and Yemen has recalibrated threats and challenges in the region.\n\nRegional strategic alignments are changing, and Israel\u2019s place in the region \u2013 in that camp that recognizes the Iranian threat to what we used to call pro-Western countries \u2013 has marginalized the decades-long urgency to place the Palestinian issue front and center.\n\nExcept in Europe. Its recent threats and bullying of Israel suggest a disconnect from the strategic reality on the ground. A two-state solution today may mean something different than it did 10 or 20 years ago.\n\nThe decades-long absence of goodwill on the Palestinian side, and the continued presence of Hamas in Gaza, means Israel must have a security presence in the Jordan Valley. For the same reasons, demilitarization of whatever Palestinian entity that may result from a negotiation is now a given. And a right of return for Palestinians and their descendants who fled the state of Israel when it was created in 1948 will not happen.\n\nTwo months out, we still have no clear indication of exactly what \u201cannexation\u201d will actually mean. It might include the Gush Etzion bloc and the city of Maale Adumim only, both large population centers very close to Jerusalem. Other options abound. Or, the whole idea could become moot, with the can being kicked down the proverbial road.\n\nWhat we do know is that Europe, which has nothing to show for its now four-decade support of Palestinian statehood, has failed in getting any return on its investment by convincing the Palestinian leadership to drop its nihilistic war against the existence of a Jewish state and negotiate an end to the conflict.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs important, Europe seems incapable \u2013 or worse, unwilling \u2013 to persuade the Palestinians to do what they\u2019ve refused to do until now, which is to finally level with their people about what is do-able and what is fantasy. Only by doing this will Palestinian leaders begin bettering the lives of those they\u2019ve used over decades to advance their own positions of status and power. The way to do this is by ending the conflict with Israel.\n\nEurope has not held the Palestinians accountable, despite protestations to the contrary. As they give a free pass to the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank \u2013 which continues to glorify and venerate those who have carried out acts of terror not only against Israelis, but Europeans and Americans as well \u2013 European governments have retreated into their familiar role of hectoring Israel.\n\nWhatever one might think of annexation, Europe\u2019s sanctimonious threats to Israel of sanctions, recalling ambassadors and worse will not move the conflict one inch closer to resolution. Israel deserves better from Europe, where anti-Semitism is rife.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nMuch of European anti-Semitism is connected to the steady drumbeat of anti-Israel rhetoric on the Internet and over the public airwaves \u2013 and from statements of political figures \u2013 that have created a threatening environment for Jewish communities across the continent.\n\nTo use a clich\u00e9 from our times, it\u2019s time for Europe to get real. With all the uncertainty swirling around us, are bluster and threats to a sister democracy \u2013 which happens to be sandwiched in the midst of chaos on all sides \u2013 a constructive use of its time?

But they were not the only targets.\n\nKAYLEIGH MCENANY SCOLDS MEDIA FOR LACK OF 'JOURNALISTIC CURIOSITY' IN FLYNN CASE\n\nIt is imperative to uncover the extent of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of U.S. intelligence for political purposes. This must include a full list of every American unmasked from intelligence reports \u2013 Trump aides, members of Congress, and ordinary Americans \u2013 and who made these requests.\n\nIt would be irresponsible for the intelligence community and Congress to turn a blind eye to this abuse simply because it happened years ago. Wrongdoing by the Obama administration in this scandal \u2013 which President Trump has dubbed \u201cObamagate\u201d \u2013 must be exposed to ensure such actions never take place again.\n\nThis week\u2019s revelation that an astounding 39 Obama administration officials \u2013 including then-Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 made 53 requests to unmask incoming Trump National Security Adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s name from National Security Agency phone intercepts between Election Day on Nov. 8, 2016 and Jan. 12, 2017 was a bombshell.\n\nThe stunning revelation regarding Obama administration spying on Flynn by secretly recording his conversations with the Russian ambassador to the U.S. at the time appears to confirm allegations by President Trump and his supporters of a broad effort by the Obama administration to weaponize intelligence to undermine the Trump presidency shortly before it began.\n\nFlynn was simply carrying out his duties by making contact with Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak during the transition period after Trump was elected president. It is perfectly routine for incoming members of a new presidential administration dealing with foreign affairs to contact foreign officials to introduce themselves before taking office.\n\nMaking this worse, the 53 unmasking requests by Obama administration officials are probably the tip of the iceberg of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of National Security Agency intelligence to target Trump aides.\n\nHouse Intelligence Committee ranking member Devin Nunes, R-Calif. confirmed this in a Fox Business interview this week on \u201cLou Dobbs Tonight\u201d when he said the Flynn unmasking scandal is \u201ceven worse than this\u201d because \u201ca whole lot\u201d of other Trump associates were unmasked.\n\nWith this in mind, it is frustrating to see former Obama officials, the mainstream media and some former intelligence officials brush off the Flynn unmasking requests by claiming such requests are \u201cnormal and routine\u201d and that all relevant rules and laws were complied with.\n\nAs a former CIA officer who helped process requests to unmask the names of U.S. citizens from National Security Agency reports, I know that unmasking requests are not normal and routine. And I believe these requests raise serious civil rights and legal issues that have not yet been addressed.\n\nFrom my 25 years working in U.S. government national security jobs, I know how sensitive and rare unmasking requests are.\n\nNames of U.S. citizens mentioned in U.S. intelligence reports \u2013 often National Security Agency communications intercepts \u2013 are redacted because under U.S. law, America\u2019s foreign intelligence services are normally not permitted to spy on U.S. citizens.\n\nAlthough senior U.S. officials are permitted to ask for the identity of a redacted name in an intelligence report (an unmasking request), such requests are unusual and the requestor must have a \u201cneed to know\u201d the identity of the U.S. person to understand the foreign intelligence information or assess its importance.\n\nWhen the request is approved, the unmasked identity is released only to the person who requested it \u2013 not to everyone who might have seen the original version of the report.\n\nFor example, during my time at the State Department from 2001-2006, Deputy Secretary Richard Armitage made about 100 demasking requests. Then-Under Secretary of State John Bolton only made 10 in four years.\n\nIronically, Senate Democrats made Bolton\u2019s unmasking requests an issue during his 2005 nomination to be U.S. ambassador to the United Nations by falsely claiming these requests were improper and made to intimidate people and gain political advantage.\n\nThen-Sen. Christopher Dodd, D-Conn., said at the time that unmasking requests were \u201crarely requested\u201d and made \u201cinfrequently\u201d by \u201cnon-career political appointees such as Mr. Bolton.\u201d\n\nAn April 14, 2005, New York Times article said this about unmasking requests in connection with the Bolton confirmation hearings: \u201cThe identities of American officials whose communications are intercepted are usually closely protected by law, and not included even in classified intelligence reports. Access to the names may be authorized by the N.S.A. only in response to special requests, and these are not common, particularly from policy makers.\u201d\n\nThe above statements about the rarity of unmasking requests are consistent with what I witnessed during my government career. In addition, the National Security Agency tightened the rules in 2005 on unmasking because of the controversy over such requests caused by the Bolton hearing.\n\nThe Obama administration, however, appeared to weaken the unmasking rules.\n\nIt is imperative to uncover the extent of the Obama administration\u2019s abuse of U.S. intelligence for political purposes\n\nThe Obama administration expanded access to National Security Agency information in February 2016 and on January 12, 2017. Both changes appeared to allow larger numbers of government officials to have access to unmasked names of Americans in intelligence reporting.\n\nEven more troubling was a major rollback by the Obama administration in rules protecting members of Congress from unmasking requests.\n\nI know from my five years on House Intelligence Committee staff of longstanding sensitivity by lawmakers that U.S. intelligence agencies could be used by the executive branch to spy on a president\u2019s political enemies. For this reason, until 2013 there were strict limits to keep members of Congress out of intelligence reporting and to prevent unmasking their names.\n\nUnder a policy in effect in the 1990s, unmasking requests of the names of members of Congress were extremely limited and generally had to be reported to the House and Senate Intelligence Committees.\n\nAccording to the Wall Street Journal, these rules were tightened further with \u201ca 2011 NSA directive [that] required direct communications between foreign intelligence targets and members of Congress to be destroyed, but [gave] the NSA director the authority to waive this requirement if he determines the communications contain \u2018significant foreign intelligence.\u201d\u201d\n\nHowever, in 2013 the Obama administration significantly weakened rules on unmasking the names of members of Congress from intelligence reports. The requestor\u2019s reason could now merely be \u201cto fully understand the intelligence.\u201d\n\nRules on notifying Congress also were weakened. National Security Agency officials henceforth would notify Congress when members were unmasked from intelligence reports \u201cas appropriate\u201d and would determine \u201cwhether and to what extent congressional notification would take place.\u201d\n\nThe Obama administration appeared to take advantage of these rules changes in 2015 when it obtained private conversations from National Security Agency reports of U.S. lawmakers who opposed the Iran nuclear deal in meetings with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\nThe rule changes on unmasking the names of members of Congress have a direct bearing on the Obama administration\u2019s unmasking of Trump aides.\n\nSince there no longer was a prohibition on using U.S. intelligence agencies to spy on members of Congress, Obama officials probably reasoned there was nothing to prevent them from spying on members of a presidential campaign or an incoming presidential administration. This helps explain the hundreds of unmasking requests regarding Trump aides in 2016 and early 2017.\n\nSo what should happen now?\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nIn addition to an investigation of spying on American citizens by the Obama administration, all Obama administration rule changes making it easier to unmask the names of members of Congress and ordinary Americans from intelligence reports need to be reversed immediately.\n\nThere also should be a requirement in the law restricting when U.S. officials can unmask the names of members of a presidential campaign or incoming administration from intelligence reports or otherwise spy on them. These rules should include a requirement for congressional notification if such spying is deemed necessary in the future.\n\nFinally, I want to know why career intelligence officials cooperated with unmasking Trump campaign and transition officials at the request of the Obama administration.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nSince the prohibition on spying on American citizens and keeping the names of U.S citizens out of intelligence reports are cardinal rules of the U.S. intelligence community, how could career intelligence officers agree to process hundreds of these requests? Why did none of them file complaints with their inspector general or the congressional intelligence oversight committees?\n\nThe hundreds of unmasking requests of Trump campaign and transition officials made by the Obama administration were in no way routine and necessary. I believe carrying out these unmasking requests was a huge ethical lapse by dozens \u2013 maybe hundreds \u2013 of U.S. intelligence community employees that must be addressed by the White House and the leaders of our intelligence agencies.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY FRED FLEITZ", "author": ["Fred Fleitz", "President Of The Center For Security Policy", "Served In As Deputy Assistant To The President", "To The Chief Of Staff Of The National Security Council.

Maybe Speaker Pelosi of San Francisco believes \u2018California Dreamin\u2019 could become the new national anthem.\u201d\n\nThere are a remarkable number of impossible-to-explain provisions in the bill. Some of them would:\n\nProvide money to people in the country illegally.\n\nAllow illegal immigrants to work when more than 30 million Americans are out of work.\n\nProvide taxpayer funding for abortion, even though Americans oppose taxpayer funding for abortions by 55 percent to 29 percent.\n\nBlock voter identification laws \u2013 even though 80 percent of Americans favor such laws.\n\nGive state and local governments, which already collect your tax dollars, $1 trillion more of your tax dollars.\n\nGive a tax cut to the richest Americans in blue states.\n\nImpose a host of other liberal fantasies on Americans.\n\nIn fact, the bill is so bad that I had also tweeted: \u201cTrump District Democrats need to be pushed on their support or opposition to the Pelosi $3 trillion bill.\u201d\n\nAs we learned about the nuttier parts of the bill after it was introduced, it struck me almost as a joke.\n\nThis bill could become a disaster for Democratic candidates if Republicans bear down and focus on it. Republicans will hate the bill. Independents and moderates will find large parts of the bill totally unacceptable.\n\nThere will be an entire series of issues in which 75 percent or 85 percent of the country will be deeply opposed to the Pelosi bill.\n\nI\n\nf this choice of which country we should become was the centerpiece of the U.S. House and Senate elections, it would probably guarantee a Republican landslide this fall. In this bill, Pelosi and the Democrats are advocating deeply unpopular issues.\n\nYet, we know Speaker Pelosi has had a long career in Congress (she was first elected 1987) fighting and earning her way to become the first woman speaker of the House (2007-2011), and then endured eight years as minority leader to become speaker for a second time.\n\nPelosi is a survivor. She is tough. She is hardworking, and she has been through a lot of campaigns \u2013 and seen and executed a lot of maneuvers.\n\nTherefore, you must assume there is a sound strategic reason for Pelosi to bring forward a bill that is this radical, expensive, and controversial.\n\nAfter spending days trying to figure out why she would lead her party into such an exposed position, let me offer this three-part proposition.\n\nFirst, Pelosi probably believes this is going to be a base turnout election, and she knows from all the polls that Republicans are more excited about the election than Democrats.\n\nPelosi had this reinforced by the special elections for House seats in Wisconsin and in California.\n\nIn Wisconsin, the GOP handily kept a House seat in an important swing state for the presidential election.\n\nCalifornia should have been a special shock to Pelosi, because the Republicans had not converted a Democratic seat in her home state since 1998. This breakthrough, after 22 years, came in a district Hillary Clinton had carried in the 2016 presidential election. The GOP win was clearly a function of a much more energized Republican base.\n\nFrom Pelosi\u2019s perspective, mobilizing the cannabis users and liberal investors is a useful move, too. They are as much part of the Democratic base as traditional small business owners are part of the Republican base.\n\nArousing the hardcore, pro-abortion activists helps Pelosi with turnout and donations. Disciplined repetition of the word \u201cdiversity\u201d appeals to her ideological activists and \u2013 to a lesser extent \u2013 minority communities.\n\nAppealing to the illegal immigrant community is a useful thing for Pelosi. And Democrats are working to make it possible for illegal immigrants to vote in a number of states.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nGiving a tax cut to the richest people in the bluest states is a direct favor to her donor base and helps the public employee unions in those states by making state and local taxes more bearable.\n\nPouring extra cash into the worst-run blue states with the biggest pension debt (think Illinois and New Jersey) directly helps Pelosi\u2019s public employee union allies and the Democratic politicians in those states.\n\nPelosi has likely calculated that \u2013 as usual \u2013 the Republican candidates will forget to focus. She also must be betting that in a few weeks the Republican and independent voters will have forgotten this monstrosity of a leftwing wish list.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nYet, Pelosi\u2019s base will be fired up to elect former Vice President Joe Biden and Democratic majorities in the House and Senate so they can get the ideological and financial goodies she has woven into this bill.\n\nIt is a major gamble on Pelosi\u2019s part.

But that\u2019s the point: so few people in LA have died, relatively speaking, that we\u2019re not certain how many are infected.\n\nWe know they\u2019re not sick enough to crowd hospitals. The city\u2019s health care system has never come close to collapsing.\n\nIn Los Angeles, the curve is now flat, and it has been flat for weeks. It could reopen tomorrow and it should and it would if its leaders were following the science.\n\nBut it\u2019s not reopening.\n\nJust the opposite is happening.\n\nLos Angeles Mayor Gil Garcetti has now extended the lockdown through the end of July, which means at least two and a half more months of it.\n\nHe\u2019s using law enforcement, liberally, to make certain that his citizens obey his orders.\n\nPolice say they\u2019ve brought criminal charges against at least 60 \u201cnon-essential\u201d businesses for the crime of going to work.\n\nCountless other businesses have shut forever.

Possibly forever, Garcetti announced this week:\n\nGARCETTI: We\u2019ve never been fully closed, we\u2019ll never be completely open until we have a cure. But I do believe that we can take steps, but monitor those numbers, listen to the scientists and the medical professionals, and make the tough calls even when there\u2019s criticism.\n\nYeah, this can\u2019t go on. It\u2019s too crazy.\n\nNow you may mock Los Angeles, and in some cases, it\u2019s deserved, there are some flaky people who live there. -- Barbra Streisand\u2019s in Malibu. But there are also an awful lot of normal, decent people in Los Angeles. Millions of them.\n\nSome of them understand where Garcetti is taking them and their city and they\u2019ve had enough.\n\nA couple of days ago, a group of them came together. It\u2019s totally bipartisan. Some of them are well-known liberal Democrats. Some are conservative Republicans and have been all their lives.\n\nOthers are labor leaders or middle-class voters.\n\nThe one thing they all have in common is the dead-certain knowledge that Mayor Eric Garcetti is poison.\n\nHe\u2019s hurting their city, he\u2019s hurting their families.\n\nGarcetti has allowed tens of thousands of mentally ill drug addicts to live on Los Angeles sidewalks and under overpasses \u2013 if you\u2019ve been there recently, you know about this.\n\nHe\u2019s also tolerated flagrant corruption in his own administration.\n\nNow he\u2019s shut the entire city down simply because he feels like it.\n\nThis group of citizens is going to try to bounce Garcetti from the mayor\u2019s office. And they can! Under California law, politicians can be recalled by voters.\n\nYou remember that Californians did it to their governor, Gray Davis, 17 years ago. It worked.\n\nNow a recall petition in California requires 330,000 signatures. And that, unfortunately, is where Garcetti has the advantage.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThanks to his extended shelter in place orders, citizens aren\u2019t allowed to gather these signatures.\n\nSo, under the guise of public health, Garcetti has stopped his political opponents from opposing him.

As long as there is no vaccine, for the Wuhan coronavirus, they can remain in power -- unchallenged -- forever. It\u2019s nice for them. They\u2019re enjoying it.\n\nBut in Los Angeles Garcetti may have gone too far.

Why am I here? How should I treat people? Where am I going? Origin, Meaning, Morality, Destiny.\n\nRavi wrote in the book, \"The issue, then, is not whether the belief system you espouse-monotheistic, atheistic, pantheistic or otherwise--is exclusive. The issue is whether the answers to the four basic questions of life pertaining to origin, meaning, morality, and destiny within the context of each of these world-views meet the tests of truth. Are they logically consistent, are they empirically adequate, and are they experientially relevant?\"\n\nRavi and I talked a lot about that on the \"Lighthouse Faith\" podcast last year in connection with his recent book, \"The Logic of God.\"\n\nIt is Ravi who said that all humans, regardless of what religion they practiced or whether they had no religious beliefs, had to answer four basic questions: Where do I come from?

Only one Republican voted for the measure. -- Rep. Pete King of New York.\n\nOn top of that, the White House has said President Trump would veto the bill in the highly unlikely event it wins Senate passage.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., has acknowledged that the HEROES (Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions) Act will not become law, but said it can be the basis for negotiations with Senate Republicans and the Trump administration.\n\nHOUSE PASSES $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF -- THE MOST EXPENSIVE BILL IN HISTORY\n\nDemocrats seem to take the position in the legislation that money is no object when it comes to spending trillions upon trillions of dollars under the cover of helping the American people deal with the coronavirus pandemic. In reality, Democrats are using the pandemic to justify their wish list of far-left Big Government schemes more extreme than anything ever enacted in American history.\n\nThe $3 trillion relief bill would be the costliest in our history as well, and would come on top of the $2.2 trillion CARES (Coronavirus Aid, Relief and Economic Security) Act passed by Congress and signed into law by President Trump in March.\n\nPerhaps if members of Congress spent as much time thinking about the impact of these free-spending bills as they did coming up with clever acronyms some of the most absurd provisions of both pieces of legislation could have been avoided.\n\nUnbelievably, some House Democrats on the far-left fringe of the party actually complained that the House bill was too modest. They\u2019d like to spend even more than $3 trillion.\n\n\"Do I think it should be bolder? Yes,\" socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, D-N.Y., told reporters. \u201cDo I think there should be more, especially as a starting offer? Absolutely.\u201d\n\nAmong the craziest provisions of the 1,800-page HEROES Act are a temporary elimination of the cap on state and local tax deductions on federal income taxes. This is a move that would mostly benefit wealthy taxpayers in blue states \u2013 people like Nancy Pelosi, among other Democratic lawmakers.\n\nThe bill would also give an eye-popping $1 trillion bailout to state and local governments to deal with their budget shortfalls caused by the shutdown of businesses and stay-at-home orders designed to halt the spread of the pandemic.\n\nDemocrats clearly don\u2019t believe in belt-tightening by state and local governments to eliminate wasteful programs during hard times. Instead, the Democrats just want to run up the national debt to stratospheric levels. Want to know who will ultimately have to pay higher taxes to pay off that debt? Look in the mirror.\n\nOther parts of the Democratic legislation passed by the House call for up to $10,000 of college debt forgiveness and a whopping $25 billion for the Postal Service.\n\nPerhaps worst of all, the legislation would provide yet another round of $1,200 economic stimulus checks for most Americans, as well as an extension of the $600 weekly unemployment insurance bonus to jobless adults until the end of January 2021 \u2013 with an option to extend the bonus payments through March 2021.\n\nThe unemployment bonus \u2013 which is paid on top of other unemployment benefits \u2013 would provide jobless workers with as much as an additional $31,200 over the course of a year for doing absolutely nothing.\n\nAfter adding the first and second rounds of stimulus checks and state unemployment benefits to the unemployment bonuses proposed by Democrats, it\u2019s clear that tens of millions of unemployed people in low-wage jobs could end up receiving significantly more money in government benefits than they earned while working.\n\nOne analysis by Ernie Tedeschi, an economist who previously worked for the Treasury Department, estimates that unemployed workers in all but a dozen states now receive about as much or more in government benefits than they did in wages prior to the economic shutdown \u2013 and his analysis didn\u2019t factor in two rounds of $1,200 stimulus checks.\n\nAlready, employers reopening their businesses have reported that they are having a hard time hiring employees for low-paying jobs because working would give so many people less money than they could collect in unemployment payments.\n\nDiscouraging people from working all the way through January 2021 or even longer is the last thing politicians should be doing in the midst of the most significant economic crash since the Great Depression, but that\u2019s exactly what House Democrats are clamoring to do. The biggest reason for the proposal is likely driven by politics, not economic considerations.\n\nThe proof is in Democrats\u2019 timeline. With so many unknowns, why would Democrats choose to call for extending bonus unemployment benefits through January 2021? Why not extend the bonus for a month or two and then reassess how state economies are performing?\n\nAfter all, many states are just now starting to reopen parts of their economies, and it\u2019s still unclear how successful those moves will be.\n\nThe most obvious reason for extending unemployment bonus payments is that January 2021 marks the beginning of the start of the next presidential term. If former Vice President Joe Biden ends up defeating President Trump in November, what better way to begin Biden\u2019s time in office than to have millions of workers forced back into the job market?\n\nIt\u2019s no wonder then that Pelosi said at a press conference discussing the HEROES Act that it is \u201creally quite an exciting time for us because we have a monumental need for our country at this sad time.\u201d\n\nThis sums up Democrats\u2019 view of the crisis: Sure, the coronavirus pandemic is a tragedy, but what an \u201cexciting\u201d tragedy for those of us looking to expand government at every turn!\n\nIt\u2019s perfectly reasonable to target government aid to those who have been hit hardest by government decisions to shut down the economy.\n\nAs the old saying goes, \u201cif you break it, you bought it,\u201d and in this case, the government unquestionably \u201cbroke\u201d the economy and forced millions of people out of their jobs.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nBut government relief programs should always be as limited and targeted as possible, and in this case, congressional Democrats and even many Republicans have chosen to do the opposite. They want to hook as many people on government aid programs as possible, instead of focusing on finding effective ways to get the country back to work as safely and quickly as they can.\n\nThe absurdity of sending $1,200 payments to millions of people who haven\u2019t lost their jobs and calling it \u201cstimulus relief\u201d proves just how outrageous this entire gargantuan cash giveaway has become.\n\nWhy would you send \u201crelief\u201d to people who haven\u2019t lost their jobs and thus aren\u2019t in any need of relief?

This was not supposed to be. Polls had Clinton\u2019s likelihood of winning at 77 percent.\n\nTRUMP VOWS TO RESUPPLY NATIONAL STOCKPILE, SAYING 'CUPBOARDS WERE BARE' AMID CORONAVIRUS PANDEMIC\n\nA key to a Trump victory this year in the Keystone State will be his energy policies, which have brought economic prosperity and created jobs in Pennsylvania. The coronavirus pandemic and the shutdown of businesses to guard against the spread of COVID-19 have derailed economies in every state, but Trump\u2019s pro-energy policies can play a crucial role in reviving the economies of Pennsylvania and the rest of our nation.\n\nIn sharp contrast, Biden and other Democrats have embraced radical energy policies demonizing fossil fuels that would bring economic pain and increased unemployment to Pennsylvania and states around the country. These far-left policies would be disastrous anytime, but would be especially so coming on top of the severe economic pain inflicted on the American people by the coronavirus.\n\nThe former vice president has even appointed socialist Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York \u2013 author of the radical Green New Deal \u2013 as co-chair of his climate policy group that is developing an energy agenda for his campaign. This is no doubt an effort to show his liberal bona fides and win over the far-left Bernie Sanders wing of the Democratic Party.\n\nHow does Ocasio-Cortez help Biden in Pennsylvania? Well, when the energy industry was imploding last month, prices bottoming and bankruptcies mounting, Ocasio-Cortez didn\u2019t express sympathy for the millions of jobs lost \u2013 let alone the financial ruin of innumerable businesses. No, she tweeted \u201cyou absolutely love to see it.\u201d\n\nHmmm.\n\nBiden, who was born in Scranton, Pa. \u2013 but moved with his family to Delaware in 1953 at age 10 \u2013 knows Pennsylvania is a vital electoral prize. That\u2019s why he set up his campaign headquarters in Philadelphia and held his first campaign event in Pittsburgh, despite being a senator from neighboring Delaware for nearly 40 years.\n\nBut voters don\u2019t really care where a candidate headquarters his campaign. They care about what a candidate can do to improve their lives. And when it comes to energy policy, the difference between the job-creating policies of Trump and the job-killing policies of Biden couldn\u2019t be more dramatic.\n\nDemographically, Pennsylvania is quite diverse, with major metropolitan areas, depressed Rust Belt towns, and a large rural population. But Pennsylvania also has something else: energy. And lots of it. It\u2019s America\u2019s third-largest coal-producing state. It\u2019s the second-largest shale gas producer. These industries employ thousands of people. And they vote.\n\nMy organization, Power The Future, published a study in January looking at the enormous economic benefits that hydraulic fracturing \u2013 better known as fracking \u2013 has brought to Pennsylvania and compared that to how New York has missed out on the economic benefits because Gov. Andrew Cuomo has unwisely banned fracking.\n\nOur study is titled \u201cNew York\u2019s Buried Opportunity: How Governor Cuomo\u2019s Policies Prevent Prosperity While Pennsylvanians Flourish.\u201d\n\nThe results of this study of neighboring states are important to voters around the nation. That\u2019s because many prominent Democrats are hostile to fracking and would no doubt pressure a President Biden to outlaw the practice nationwide \u2013 even though this method of extracting oil and natural gas has a strong record of safety and has played a crucial role in reducing our dependence on foreign energy.\n\nFracking has generated $1.7 billion in new tax revenue for Pennsylvania since 2012 and a remarkable 36 percent increase in wages for oil and gas employees in the state.\n\nDuring the Great Recession of 2008 to 2012 \u2013 when Pennsylvania was losing jobs overall \u2013 fracking jobs increased an astounding 259 percent, with the vast majority of these jobs in rural areas.\n\nEnergy has been a boon for the state because despite the recession, despite the collapse of the housing market and the Wall Street market tumble, America will always need energy.\n\nJob losses in the energy industry caused by the coronavirus pandemic are temporary. But if Democrats succeed under a Biden administration in banning fracking and taking other anti-fossil fuels actions, the job losses would become permanent. This would have a far more devastating impact on the hardworking men and women who produce the energy that powers America.\n\nPennsylvania is one of the leading energy-producing states, employing tens of thousands of energy workers. They will once again have a crucial role in this upcoming presidential election.\n\nCurrently, 28 percent of Pennsylvania\u2019s overall workforce is unemployed due to the coronavirus pandemic \u2013 a shocking and tragic number. Of the 1.8 million men and women who have filed for unemployment in the state, there\u2019s no doubt some have come from the energy industry.\n\nWe need to get these energy workers back on the job as soon as possible, consistent with public health guidelines needed to combat the spread of COVID-19. The last thing these workers need is permanent unemployment caused by unwise Democratic policies.\n\nBiden has made it clear what he thinks about Pennsylvania and its energy industry, despite putting his campaign headquarters in the state.\n\nOne would expect the Biden campaign to make an aggressive pivot to the center in an appeal for Pennsylvania\u2019s voters, but appointing someone as out-of-touch and downright offensive as Ocasio-Cortez to guide his energy policy shows his complete disconnect with reality.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAs President Trump aims to reopen America and restart our economy, he knows we will need energy. The airline industry will come back, but not without energy. Cruise ships, travel, tourism, resorts and hotels all need energy.\n\nMillions of Americans \u2013 once permitted to resume commuting to work \u2013 will need energy for their vehicles. Every business and industry in the nation will only be able to return to full economic strength if Americans can be sure we will have inexpensive, reliable and abundant domestic energy. And Pennsylvania has a lot of it.\n\nNo one wanted the coronavirus to invade America and cripple our economy. The last thing we need is to adopt Democratic energy policies that will further cripple our economy by design.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nTrump can tell Pennsylvania\u2019s energy workers he wants them fully employed, providing for their families, contributing to their communities and building our nation back to its full economic strength.\n\nBiden\u2019s message to these same energy workers is that he will put more of them on the unemployment rolls, and his message to all voters is that he will destroy our energy independence and ship billions of dollars out of our pockets to other countries to buy the energy we should be producing right here in America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE BY DANIEL TURNER", "author": ["Daniel Turner"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.foxnews.com/~r/foxnews/opinion/~3/GqIMgkBTjpw/biden-press-corp-trump-tim-graham", "published": "2020-05-15T18:18:12", "title": "Tim Graham: Biden still hiding from a press corps that will never dare grill him like Trump", "text": "Joe Biden\u2019s virtual campaign for president is a strange journey, with \u201cvirtual rallies\u201d and \u201cvirtual rope lines\u201d (whatever that is).

Three days later, restaurants and theaters followed. Hospitals once again were allowed to perform all needed surgeries. They could stop pretending that coronavirus was the only medical problem that patients faced. It is not.\n\nThere nothing especially radical about what Georgia did, but you wouldn't know that if you were watching television that week. The decision was described there as the most reckless, public health decision since 9 out of 10 family doctors endorsed Camel cigarettes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nUntold millions would die because Georgia was reopening. The state of Georgia would be flattened by a tidal wave of corpses. It was that dangerous.\n\nEven Stacy Abrams took a break from campaigning for vice president to offer an assessment.\n\nWe should be thrilled by this news because it suggests that America can begin to return to normal, restore the rights stolen from the population, maybe even treat citizens like adults once again, and not court medical disasters. You would think our leadership would be racing to the podium to share this great news. But of course, they are not -- just the opposite.\n\nStacy Abrams, former Georgia gubernatorial candidate: We honestly don't understand the mayors of our largest cities who have all expressed deep concern, that of our scientists.\n\nThis makes no sense and it doesn't improve our economy, it simply puts more Georgians at risk.\n\nYes, she seems to know what she is talking about. You should know, though, that Stacey Abrams is delusional. At one point, she announced that she was the governor of Georgia, which, from a mental health standpoint, is one step from claiming you're Napoleon.\n\nNow, Abrams imagines she is a public health expert. It's best to humor her on that. Just nod and look interested.\n\nChris Hayes is not a scientist, either. He is MSNBC's most ardent male feminist. But he still has strong views on epidemiology.\n\nHayes was so upset by the idea that people in Georgia might go outside without permission that he suddenly found himself arguing that everybody must obey the Trump administration.\n\nChris Hayes, MSNBC host: If that sounds insane to you, you are not alone. And for the record, Georgia does not meet the White House guidelines. It does not a 14-day trajectory of declining cases. It has tested less than 90,000 people out of a population of more than 10 million. Mayors in Georgia are describing the Governor's decision as reckless, dangerous, and illogical.\n\nOh, the voice of overpriced Brooklyn. \"We must do what the White House tells us!\" he screams on MSNBC. That is how dangerous it was. Mark this day, wrote one longtime Washington reporter, because two and three weeks from now, the Georgia death toll is blood on Gov. Brian Kemp's hands.\n\nWell, as it happens, we did, in fact, mark that day. It was April 25, 2020, when the reopenings began. That day, Georgia had 650 new cases of coronavirus. On Wednesday, which was 18 days later, Georgia had a total of 555 cases of coronavirus.\n\nInfections and death in Georgia have been declining since early April -- that's why they began to reopen it. There are still sick people in the state. There will be for a while; some of them will die.\n\nBut as of Thursday night, Georgia's numbers -- the actual numbers -- are no worse than the national average, and that tells us a lot. We should be thrilled by this news because it suggests that America can begin to return to normal, restore the rights stolen from the population, maybe even treat citizens like adults once again, and not court medical disasters.\n\nYou would think our leadership would be racing to the podium to share this great news. But of course, they are not -- just the opposite. In fact, they are doubling down on authoritarianism. They enjoyed being in total control of your life. They do not plan to relinquish the power they received from this pandemic anytime soon, if ever.\n\nAsk yourself how many healthy middle-aged people do you know who have died from this virus? Maybe you know someone. How many people do you know who are now unemployed and terrified of the future? Probably a lot.\n\nThe city of Los Angeles, for example, has extended its lockdown through the end of July. Citizens there will have to wear masks at all times, even when they are outside, where the risk of transmission is minimal.\n\nMayor Eric Garcetti did not explain the science behind these commands. There isn't any science. Instead, Garcetti told his city, that until there is a \"cure\" for the virus, life will never go back to normal -- never.\n\nThe mayor did not mention that it is possible -- in fact, it is likely -- that there will never be a cure for the coronavirus. Whatever.\n\nNancy Pelosi didn't ask questions about it. She just quickly endorsed the whole thing.\n\nWillie Geist, MSNBC anchor: There are a lot of people in Los Angeles County who are saying, \"Whoa, three more months. I can't survive this as a small business, I can't survive this as someone who is out of work.\"\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi: Well, of course, I agree with the decisions of the people on the ground in their particular venue and location. So yes, it is inconvenient, but it is even more inconvenient if you are going to be infected or worse.\n\nYes, it is inconvenient. But it is not as inconvenient as getting infected with a deadly disease, says Pelosi.\n\nThat's a good talking point, by the way. Hat tip to the 26-year-old staffer who wrote it. But as a factual matter, it is wrong.\n\nFor the overwhelming majority of Americans, the lockdowns are far worse than getting sick with the Wuhan coronavirus. If you are under 60, the odds of dying from this virus are fewer than 1 in 1,000, probably less than 1 in 10,000.\n\nThe odds meanwhile, that government lockdowns are making you poorer and destroying your life -- those chances are far higher than that. Ask yourself how many healthy middle-aged people do you know who have died from this virus? Maybe you know someone. How many people do you know who are now unemployed and terrified of the future? Probably a lot.\n\nThis is insanity. Obviously and at some point, we are going to look back in shame as we consider it. ... The question is for the rest of us: Why are the rest of us allowing this to happen?\n\nWashington Gov. Jay Inslee is not a math guy. He is not calculating probabilities like this. Inslee apparently believes that everyone in Washington state faces the real likelihood of dying from the virus, and that's why he has ordered officials in the state to track who goes to restaurants and who they eat with -- because that is not a Chinese police state tactic or anything.\n\nWashington state Gov. Jay Inslee: This contact tracing, obviously, if you have somebody who has become sick and they were sitting right next to a person at a restaurant -- to be able to identify that person could be very valuable for their health to try to save their life, and so we put that in place.\n\nYes, it's kind of weird that the authorities are taking notes on who you are having dinner with. But, you know, it's for the public health, so submit. It's not like politicians will ever misuse that information or anything. So sleep well, but don't forget to send in a blood sample so the government can sequence your DNA for public health reasons.\n\nNobody in America is enjoying all of this more than Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. It is always the most mediocre people who love fascism the most. It gives them power they never dreamed that they would have and indeed, don't deserve.\n\nWhitmer wants this moment to last forever. She is enraged that anyone would dare to complain about it. She went on ABC on Wednesday and dismissed any citizen who disagrees with her, needless to say, as a racist. And then she promised that disobedient citizens in Michigan -- serfs -- will be punished with more severe lockdowns.\n\nMichigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer: These have been really political rallies where people come with Confederate flags and Nazi symbolism and calling for violence.\n\nThis is racist and misogynistic, and I ask that everybody who has a platform uses it to call on people to observe the best practices promulgated by the CDC and to stop encouraging this behavior because it only makes it that much more precarious for us to try to reengage our economy, which is what everyone says they want us to be able to do.\n\nYes, not only is it racist, it is dangerous to the public health -- and racism.\n\nWhitmer was later asked if she had evidence, proof, that protesters were actually spreading the virus, and you will be surprised to learn she didn't. And by the way, that question is misogynistic, so shut up, bigot.\n\nSome people in Michigan are finally growing tired of this performance. Karl Manke owns a barbershop. He would like to continue cutting hair. Authorities won't let him do that. They prefer to send him welfare checks instead. That is not the country he wants to live in, though.\n\nKarl Manke, Michigan barbershop owner: I am 77. I've always worked. I have never looked for handouts. I don't even know what they are. I haven't -- somebody called me and said, well, why didn't you get on food stamps? Well, I don't want food stamps. I want to work.\n\nWhen our governor said we are going to have another 28 days, it knocked me to my knees. I couldn't take another 28 days. All of us as Americans need to begin to take responsibility for ourselves, you know? I feel that the government is not my mother. It never has been, you know. And matter of fact, this administration, for the most part, I've been in business longer than they've been alive.\n\nGretchen Whitmer was not amused by that. \"The government is not my mom\" -- misogyny. And by the way, cutting hair is racist.\n\nSo Whitmer's administration tried to shut Manke down with a court order because there's nothing else going on in Michigan right now. A judge resisted that it was too far.\n\nSo, Whitmer's lackey simply revoked Manke's barber's license. Now, he is shut down for good and will be even when the lockdowns finally end. That will show him. Stop whining and take your welfare check, bigot.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThis is insanity.

Now, more than ever, it is important to protect, support and uplift children and families by providing services pivotal to their stability.\n\nAs a part of President Trump\u2019s whole-of-government and whole-of-America approach to the coronavirus, ACF has thought strategically, innovatively and out-of-the-box about ways to support our programs and our communities during this time of crisis. Through actions like granting regulatory flexibilities and waivers, sending guidance, hosting webinars and much more, we have been able to continue serving America\u2019s children and families during this time.\n\nROBERT O'BRIEN: VENTILATORS FOR CORONAVIRUS \u2014 US IS ARSENAL OF HEALTH IN WAR ON COVID-19\n\nIn recognizing the critical importance of protecting the health of our child welfare workers and service providers, ACF worked with Eric Hargan, deputy secretary for HHS, to send a letter to governors. We encouraged them to work with their emergency management programs to classify child welfare workers and service providers as level 1 emergency responders in order for them to have greater access to personal protective equipment.\n\nWe also looked for opportunities within our programs like Head Start, which promotes school readiness of children under 5, where we can use their resources and talent to serve our communities in supporting emergency child care. Recently our Office of Head Start clarified how programs can support, when possible, the use of closed Head Start centers as temporary child care centers for medical personnel and essential workers. These efforts will help support our front-line workers with a safe and child-friendly environment so they can continue their important work.\n\nACF also took action by urging child welfare legal and judicial leaders to work together to ensure that necessary court hearings continue during this pandemic. We encouraged access to visits and other activities virtually where physical contact is not possible and in addition to physical contact, as well as clarified questions around the evolving crisis where courts have had to restrict parent/child face-to-face contact.\n\nWe also advised child welfare leaders of the flexibility of certain requirements regarding fingerprint-based criminal records checks and caseworker visits to a child\u2019s home.\n\nThrough our actions during this pandemic, we have developed countless new ideas that are adaptable to how we serve vulnerable populations nationwide in the months and years to come.\n\nFinding ways to be innovative virtually has made a difference in helping to meet the needs of children in foster care during this time, because life doesn\u2019t stop for them during pandemics.\n\nThe historic coronavirus relief package, the CARES Act, which President Trump signed into law on April 23, delivered a strong financial foundation of over $6 billion for our programs affected by COVID-19, including child care and child welfare.\n\nIn an effort to support the learning of children disrupted by the crisis, the bill includes up to $500 million for summer Head Start programs. We also secured $3.5 billion in supplemental funding for the Child Care and Development Block Grant to help states, territories and tribes address COVID-19 impacts on child care. Among other purposes, these supplemental funds can be used to provide child care assistance to health care workers, first responders and other essential workers playing critical roles during this crisis.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nWe also understand how important it is to inform our grantees and the vulnerable populations we serve about the actions taken and assistance we are providing, which is why we dedicated a web page to providing a comprehensive list of resources, information and services.\n\nThrough our actions during this pandemic, we have developed countless new ideas that are adaptable to how we serve vulnerable populations nationwide in the months and years to come. Going forward, we want to continue implementing better, stronger and more innovative ways to deliver human services.

There were newspaper stories and TV documentaries about how long survivors of a nuclear war would have to stay inside reinforced shelters until the fallout dissipated to a point it was safe to go out. Then, it was Geiger counters that would determine the level of radioactivity.\n\nCAL THOMAS: AMID CORONAVIRUS, GREATEST GENERATION STILL HAS LESSONS TO TEACH US\n\nToday\u2019s Geiger counters are temperature gauges held to our foreheads. Symptoms, such as coughing, sneezing and fever, as well as high-risk factors, such as age and underlying health conditions, are also part of the diagnostic equation.\n\nWe are told to frequently wash our hands, not touch our faces, don\u2019t shake hands with anyone, practice social distancing \u2014 we can recite these from memory \u2014 but then we are also told to stay inside and only go out for \u201cnecessities,\u201d such as food and prescriptions.\n\nGrocery stores where I shop require masks when entering and one-way traffic aisles. A hard plastic \u201cwall\u201d separates me from the cashier, who is also wearing a mask. Hand sanitizers and wipes are available at the entrance and exit where cart handles are wiped down after each use.\n\nIf these practices are almost as good as staying home, why can\u2019t businesses employing these practices, including restaurants and bars, be opened so people can make a living and not rely on government, whose debt now exceeds levels that will never be reduced without spending cuts (and likely tax increases if Democrats win the November election)? Restaurants can place tables six feet apart. Those operating in warmer climates could add outside tables, benches and chairs. For the fearful, takeout orders could be ramped up.\n\nAs experts have noted, it could be months and possibly longer before a vaccine is created. And there probably is more than one strain, as with influenza, so a single vaccine is unlikely to protect everyone from every strain.\n\nLast Sunday, my wife and I went to a local restaurant. Tables had been removed. We wore masks as did staff behind the counter. We purchased our food, left the place and ate outside without masks where tables and benches were available. There were others there, not all of whom were six feet apart. People engaged in social interaction, which is what humans do and need to do. No one seemed fearful.\n\nAs experts have noted, it could be months and possibly longer before a vaccine is created. Dr. Anthony Fauci, head of the U.S. National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, told a Senate committee Tuesday there is no guarantee a vaccine will work. And there probably is more than one strain, as with influenza, so a single vaccine is unlikely to protect everyone from every strain.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nDoes that mean staying at home until perfect safety can be guaranteed?

At the war\u2019s beginning, no one believed Germany would utterly collapse in May 1945.\n\nOn the morning of Dec. 7, 1941, the day of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor, German invaders were on the verge of capturing Moscow. Britain was isolated. London had barely survived a terrible German bombing during the blitz.\n\nA sleeping America was neutral, but it was beginning to realize it was weak and mostly unarmed in a scary world.\n\nREBECCA GRANT: WORLD WAR II IN EUROPE ENDED EXACTLY 75 YEARS AGO \u2013 IT HAS LESSONS FOR WAR AGAINST CORONAVIRUS\n\nBut by 1943, a booming U.S. economy was fielding vast military forces from Alaska to the Sahara. Britain and America were bombing the German heartland. The Soviet Red Army had trapped and destroyed a million-man German army at Stalingrad.\n\nHow did the Allies \u2014 Britain, the Soviet Union and the U.S. \u2014 turn around the European war so quickly?\n\nThe huge Red Army would suffer close to 11 million deaths in halting German offensives. Britain would never give up despite terrible losses at home and at sea from German bombers, rockets and submarines.\n\nYet the key to victory was the U.S. economy. It would eventually outproduce all the major economies on both sides of the war combined.\n\nBut how did the U.S. arm so quickly, build such effective weapons so soon, and from almost nothing field a military some 12 million strong?\n\nNeo-socialist President Franklin D. Roosevelt unleashed American business under the aegis of successful entrepreneurs such as Henry Ford of the Ford Motor Co., William Knudsen of General Motors, Henry Kaiser of Kaiser Shipyards and Charles Wilson of General Electric.\n\nThey were all given relatively free rein from New Deal strictures to work and profit without burdensome government regulations. The result was a military juggernaut that overwhelmed America\u2019s enemies.\n\nPolitics went on but in a less partisan fashion. Republicans picked up seats in the House and Senate in 1942, while Roosevelt won a fourth presidential term in 1944.\n\nRoosevelt was able to dodge charges of rank partisanship during the war by appointing Republicans to key positions in his administration. Republican Henry Stimson became secretary of war. Former Republican vice presidential candidate Frank Knox was the all-important secretary of the Navy. Roosevelt stocked the War Production Board with Republican capitalists.\n\nGovernment cannot restore prosperity. Only entrepreneurs and risk-takers can. Americans must master their fears of the virus and dare to go back to work.\n\nThe media turned from either propagandizing the success of the New Deal or hyping its failures to warning Americans of the looming existential threat that would soon make their differences irrelevant.\n\nMost importantly, Americans lost their fears.\n\nFrom 1929 to 1938, the U.S. economy was in ruins. FDR\u2019s New Deal could not restore economic growth or consumer confidence. As late as 1938, economic growth had sunk to negative 3.3 percent. Unemployment soared to an unsustainable 19 percent.\n\nOnly the threat of war terrified Americans into taking a gamble \u2014 to work feverishly and to ramp up industry.\n\nBy the end of 1941, the early rearmament effort had spiked GDP growth to 17.7 percent. Unemployment had fallen to about 10 percent and would soon fall to about 2 percent.\n\nAmericans began losing their dread that they could do nothing against a decade-long depression. The less they feared the Axis powers, the more they restarted the economy and began to produce a plethora of goods and services.\n\nAfter Pearl Harbor, Americans did not stay neutral, wait for government assistance or expect other nations to protect them.\n\nDoes World War II offer any lessons regarding our wrecked economy and staggering unemployment from the lockdown reaction to the coronavirus?\n\nPerhaps.

Bin Laden\u2019s rationale for his horrific plot was telling: \u201cBiden is totally unprepared for that post, which will lead the U.S. into a crisis.\u201d\n\nNow, a decade since U.S. Special Forces killed bin Laden in Pakistan, it\u2019s my guess that President Xi Jinping of China \u2013 our greatest geopolitical foe today \u2013 also wants former Vice President Joe Biden to be the next president of the United States. This makes perfect sense when you consider that Xi wants what\u2019s best for China.\n\nJoe Biden has been wrong on U.S. policy toward China virtually his entire career. In fact, Biden and other establishment politicians in Washington have been instrumental in China\u2019s meteoric rise from a developing nation into a Communist power with global ambitions.\n\nSEN. THOM TILLIS: CORONAVIRUS AND CHINA \u2014 US RECOVERY INCLUDES HOLDING BEIJING ACCOUNTABLE\n\nFor decades, China has executed a foreign policy focused on replacing the United States as the world\u2019s leading economy.\n\nDuring his time as lead Democrat on the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, Biden gave a floor speech in September 2000 in support of Permanent Normal Trade Relations (PNTR) with China. He said, \u201cFinally, I would like to point out that my support for permanent normal trade relations with China is based not just on an assessment of the economic benefits to the U.S., not just on the prospects for political reform in China, but also on the impact on our national security.\u201d\n\nTwenty years later, on each of the three prongs he laid out to justify his support for the legislation, it\u2019s clear that Biden was dead wrong.\n\nStatistics show that 3.7 million American jobs have been lost to China since 2001 due to our horrendous anti-U.S. worker policies. Furthermore, China has imprisoned upwards of one million Muslim Uighurs and other minorities in \u201cre-education camps.\u201d It also, according to reports, jailed more than 48 journalists in 2019 alone just for seeking the truth. And today we face a global pandemic with more than 80,000 Americans dying from COVID-19 because China chose to lie instead of help save lives.\n\nSo much for Biden\u2019s promises of economic prosperity, political reform and national security.\n\nAbout a decade after his pro-PNTR vote, in 2011, Vice President Biden doubled down on his cozy rhetoric toward China in an op-ed he wrote for The New York Times. Biden shamelessly reiterated his unwise support for the Chinese government, stating, \u201cI remain convinced that a successful China can make our country more prosperous, not less.\u201d He added, \u201cI am convinced, from nearly a dozen hours spent with Vice President Xi Jinping, that China\u2019s leadership agrees.\u201d\n\nBiden is choosing to ignore the fact that President Trump singlehandedly changed the debate and rallied America around his get-tough-on Beijing policy.\n\nBiden, who first visited China in 1979, couldn\u2019t see that the Communist leadership there was playing him for a fool. He closed the editorial by saying, \u201cSome may warn of America\u2019s demise, but I\u2019m not among them. And let me reassure you: based on my time in China, neither are the Chinese.\u201d\n\nLet Biden\u2019s naivety sink in and juxtapose it with President Trump\u2019s actions on China \u2013 which show he\u2019s been right from the beginning. You would think that Biden would observe this president\u2019s leadership and success in negotiating with China and change his ways \u2013 but you\u2019d be wrong.\n\nBiden is choosing to ignore the fact that President Trump singlehandedly changed the debate and rallied America around his get-tough-on Beijing policy.\n\nExactly one year ago at a May campaign rally, Biden boasted, \u201cChina is going to eat our lunch? Come on, man ... they can\u2019t figure out how they\u2019re going to deal with the corruption that exists within the system. I mean, you know, they\u2019re not bad folks, folks. But guess what, they\u2019re not, they\u2019re not competition for us.\u201d\n\nIn our current reality, this statement personifies how wrongheaded Biden remains on China.\n\nA typical liberal like Sleepy Joe in the White House would return to failed globalist policies and China would pass the United States as the world\u2019s leading economic superpower and never look back.\n\nA Biden administration would accept the failed status quo at the United Nations that President Trump has called out; a Biden administration would fund the World Health Organization and accept business as usual, and a Biden administration would consent to new job-killing global compacts that would destroy Trump\u2019s policies that prioritize the working men and women in America.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nThe bottom line is that Biden\u2019s disastrous policies would take us back to the days of economic stagnation.\n\nTrump came into office with the goal of making America great again. It wasn\u2019t some poll-tested slogan that sounded good in speeches \u2013 it was a promise to the American people. It was a promise that the failed economy of the Obama-Biden administration, characterized by slow growth and vanishing job opportunities, would not be tolerated.\n\nUpon entering office, President Trump confronted Chinese Communist leaders with his ironclad promise to the American people that he would bring our economy roaring back to life. The idea that America\u2019s time was up and that China was the future simply did not sit well with the president.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nBefore the coronavirus escaped Wuhan and infected the world, our unemployment rate had dropped to historic lows, stocks had risen to record highs, and millions of new jobs were being created right here in America, thanks to this tremendous president.\n\nChina and who can best rebuild our economy will be the dominant issues on Election Day and that\u2019s bad news for Joe Biden.

Sign up here.\n\nThe $3 trillion coronavirus relief bill backed by House Democrats was headed for a vote in that chamber Friday, although Republican opposition in the Senate was expected to prevent the bill from ever becoming law.\n\nHouse Speaker Nancy Pelosi, D-Calif., said Thursday that the legislation could become the basis of negotiations with the Republican-controlled Senate and the White House for compromise legislation.\n\nThe White House issued an official veto threat Thursday for the Democratic bill, which would be the biggest relief package in history.\n\nPELOSI CALLS $3T CORONAVIRUS RELIEF BILL DEMOCRATS' STARTING OFFER AS WHITE HOUSE ISSUES VETO THREAT\n\nAmong its flaws, the Democratic bill \u2013 called the HEROES (Health and Economic Recovery Omnibus Emergency Solutions) Act \u2013 threatens to undermine the increased workplace flexibility and accommodations that workers and employers alike need to deal with the coronavirus pandemic.\n\nThe Democratic bill includes a full-year extension of what was supposed to be a temporary mandate on small businesses to provide up to 12 weeks of paid sick and family leave to all workers.\n\nProponents of the legislation present this as another gift to workers \u2013 but it\u2019s not. The mandate would make it harder for employers to stay afloat amid changing circumstances and meet their employees\u2019 unique needs. Workers could expect more job losses, and those out of work would have a harder time finding jobs.\n\nUnder the proposal, the paid leave mandate that took effect April 1 would not sunset until the end of 2021. Throughout this year and next, employers would be required to provide both full- and part-time employees with up to 12 weeks of emergency paid sick and family leave.\n\nAlthough employers can fill out paperwork and send in documentation to receive a credit for some or all of the paid leave they provide, it\u2019s neither a straightforward nor simple process. Rather, Congress dictates the terms and conditions, which often overlap and interfere with employers\u2019 own policies and other provisions Congress has enacted.\n\nFor example, Congress dictates that workers qualify to receive the benefits their first day on the job and says the benefits must be given on top of any preexisting sick leave benefits, which cannot be changed by employers.\n\nBut COVID-19 has forced businesses and households alike to readjust their finances, and some businesses need to temporarily adjust their employees\u2019 benefits packages.\n\nThe mandate also dictates that employers allow the leave to be taken intermittently or as a reduced work schedule. Moreover, employers cannot ask for documentation of an employee\u2019s need for leave until seven days after the employee has returned from work.\n\nEmployers also cannot discipline, discharge or otherwise discriminate against any worker who takes paid sick or family leave, and they must restore workers who take leave to the same or equivalent position after their leave.\n\nThese mandates derail the organic process of businesses finding ways to meet their unique situations and needs. Instead of using their existing paid leave policies and focusing on adjusting to remote work options and keeping their businesses alive, employers are having to figure out how to comply with the new mandate.\n\nRather than help workers stay employed, this extended mandate could exacerbate unemployment.\n\nNearly a quarter of all U.S. workers have already filed for unemployment in just the last nine weeks. For nearly 37 million newly unemployed Americans, government-mandated paid leave benefits are meaningless; their priority is finding a job and getting their careers back on track.\n\nThat will become much less likely if Congress moves to make it even more expensive and more complicated for businesses to rehire. And regrettably, it could put women \u2013 who are more likely to be primary caregivers \u2013 at a disadvantage in the job market.\n\nThis paid leave mandate simply isn\u2019t necessary. Federal law already requires employers with more than 50 employees to provide up to 12 weeks of unpaid family and medical leave.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nMost employers want to do right by their employees and that\u2019s why the overwhelming majority of full-time workers already have paid leave benefits. But employers don\u2019t need to be altruistic to realize that it\u2019s in their best interests to allow and even encourage sick workers to stay home. That\u2019s never been truer than during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nRather than meddle in the employee-employer relationship with a sweeping mandate that burdens small businesses, encourages layoffs, and curtails workplace flexibility, policymakers ought to focus on the real vulnerabilities that people face. That is, the risk that unreasonably prolonged, forced shutdowns will cause thousands of businesses to shutter their doors for good and that potentially millions of jobs will be lost and could take years to recover.\n\nCongress should make it easier for workers to prepare for time off by expanding opportunities to save pre-tax income, allowing workers to opt for comp time rather than additional overtime pay (a policy change including in the Working Families Flexibility Act) and reducing costly mandates, taxes, and regulations that prevent employers from having the resources necessary to provide paid leave.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nAnd Congress can help workers accommodate to evolving work situations \u2013 including remote work and more flexible schedules to adjust to children being home \u2013 by easing restrictions on home-based businesses and clarifying the definition of an employee so that workers have more options to earn a living and be their own bosses, if that\u2019s what they want.\n\nAmericans want the opportunity to work and provide for themselves and their families. They know that employers face real challenges staying afloat and keeping workers paid.

Cuomo, Chris Cuomo asked: \u201cDo you think you are an attractive person now because you\u2019re single and ready to mingle? Do you really think you are some desirable single person, and that this is not just people\u2019s pain coming out of them?\u201d\n\nAndrew Cuomo replied: \u201cI think beauty is in the eye of the beholder.\u201d\n\nAnd 5,200 people died in rest homes.\n\nCLICK HERE TO SIGN UP FOR OUR OPINION NEWSLETTER\n\nAnyway, the Pew poll suggests the media don't act on behalf of the public.

The first tool that we have in this three-dimensional world is our body. The second tool that we have is our mind (our ego). And the third, which is the most powerful tool that we have, is our heart. That is our soul.\n\nHow can we use these three tools to have the best experience possible in this life, especially during these challenging times like right now? Let's go through them.\n\n1. The body\n\nThe body is here to help us experience things that we would not be able to experience without having a body. The body allows us to hold hands with people, allows us to grab things like an inspiring book or the TV remote to watch an amazing movie. It allows us to type in beautiful emails to loved ones. It allows us to, even though we're still at home, walk, exercise and move. It allows us to feel and experience things. And so it's up to us to choose if we're going to experience pain or if we're going to experience amazing feelings and emotions through our body. So let's put it at use towards all those beautiful things that we would not be able to experience without a body.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons Spirituality Is Integral to an Emotionally Wealthy Life\n\n2. The mind\n\nWe tend to allow the mind or the ego to take control of things. However, the soul, the heart should be in command. The mind is just here to understand what the soul is saying. Pay attention and listen to what the soul is saying and then execute rationally in the three-dimensional world what the soul is commanding.\n\nHow do you know if it's your soul commanding or your ego or mind commanding? It's pretty simple. You have to ask yourself the question, am I acting from a place of fear or am I acting from a place of love? If you're acting from a place of fear, you'll know right away. And so instead you need to observe and you need to identify what the fear behind is? Go deep down, find and dissolve that pattern. Not only do you have to do that, but you also have to ask yourself the question: If I was acting from a place of love, what would I do right now?\n\nRelated: How Tapping Into Your Spiritual Energy Can Improve Your Productivity\n\nAnd make sure that you're always executing things through your mind from a place of love, of certainty, of truth, of powerful, limitless, infinite possibility. Again, do not let your ego confuse you. You are in control. By you, I mean your consciousness, your soul, which is your infinite you. Not your three-dimensional you that will go away when we all die. I'm talking about the infinite you, which is your soul.\n\n3. The soul\n\nYou can access the soul through connecting to your heart. When you're connected to your heart, you're connected to your soul, you're connected to the source, you're connected to your infinite power, you're connected to your higher self, you're connected to God, the Universe, or whatever you may want to call it. It's important that we use that tool. Now it's difficult when there's so much outer noise, right? So much outer fear and confusion. You have to truly learn to turn down completely that outer confusion noise and voice and find that inner voice instead. Connect to your inner voice and when you are connected, all you have to do is ask a question and listen. You ask a question and listen. As you practice that over and over, you will receive clearer answers, quicker answers, and precise answers, which could come in different forms. They can come through visions, an inner voice, a very strong feeling, or simply an inner knowing of what to do next. The four intuitive gifts that we all have.\n\nUse the three tools we have today available to make the best out of this living. I promise you, it is a wonderful, wonderful journey.

It makes thousands of video titles available for free to its Amazon Prime members, and you can also rent or buy many other new and classic films. But there\u2019s so much to choose from that it can be a bit overwhelming.\n\nRelated: 10 TV Shows Every Entrepreneur Should Watch on Netflix\n\nThe films listed below offer important lessons on a variety of topics relevant to entrepreneurs. To help you get the most out of your movie-watching experience, I\u2019ve sorted these films under key topics and categorized them as being available to rent through Amazon, or available to watch for free through Amazon Prime.\n\nThese 10 movies go beyond entertainment: They set high standards and showcase the skills and drive you\u2019ll need to be a success, as well as warn against greed and corruption.\n\nStories that bring Wall Street to life\n\nFrom corrupt stockbrokers to astute hedge fund managers, these movies capture some of Wall Street\u2019s most intriguing true stories.\n\n1. The Wolf of Wall Street \u2013 available for rent through Amazon\n\nThis hit movie tells a wild, over-the-top tale that happens to be based on a true story. The plot revolves around scam-artist stockbroker Jordan Belfort (played by Leonardo DiCaprio), who takes an entry level job at a Wall Street brokerage firm.\n\nWhat to watch for: Belfort was a great entrepreneur who successfully built something out of nothing, but unfortunately his company was riddled with corruption and deceit. This story offers entrepreneurs important lessons, not the least of which is: Don\u2019t be a crook.\n\n2. The Big Short \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThe Big Short tells the story of a group of Wall Street fund managers and investors who were able to see the looming housing market crisis long before it began to implode in 2007 and 2008. The movie chronicles the work of hedge fund manager Michael Burry (played by Christian Bale), who discovers that financial institutions are bundling risky subprime mortgages into \u201cAAA-rated\u201d prime mortgage\u2212backed securities that were sold to investors. He realizes the U.S. housing market is perched atop a huge asset bubble that is about to burst.\n\nWhat to watch for: Burry creates a credit default swap that allows him to short, or bet against, those bonds, making his investors a bundle of money when the housing market tanks. The biggest lesson here is that while everyone else scoffed at him because they believed the market was unbreakable, Burry stuck to his guns and his strategy paid off.\n\nThe story behind American icon Walt Disney\n\nWalt Disney was a pioneer in animation and in the entertainment industry. These movies take a deeper look at his backstory and the creative process he used to create his iconic characters.\n\n3. Saving Mr. Banks \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nThis movie tells the story behind Walt Disney\u2019s quest to obtain the rights to P.L. Travers\u2019 novel Mary Poppins. Despite Disney\u2019s best efforts, Travers rebuffs every offer he makes because she fears Disney\u2019s version of her story won\u2019t be true to the characters she has created. She criticizes every step in the process to adapt the book into a movie script, nearly upending the project.\n\nWhat to watch for: The delicate way Disney handles this situation. He could have easily let the project sink or tried to pressure Travers to comply. Instead, he seeks to better understand her concerns and hear her out. He eventually finds a way to win her over, and his tenacity results in a movie that won universal acclaim and audience adoration for generations to come.\n\n4. Walt Before Mickey \u2013 available for free through Amazon Prime\n\nWhile you have likely heard about Walt Disney\u2019s many accomplishments, you may not be familiar with the many difficulties he faced on the way to success. Walt Before Mickey depicts a number of failures Disney had to overcome as he doggedly built a career for himself in animated films. This is the story of Disney\u2019s early years. Before he created Mickey Mouse, Disney created another famous animated character, Oswald Rabbit. But Disney didn't own the copyright to that character, and he had to let Oswald go.\n\nWhat to watch for: Owning your work is one of the many lessons he learned on the bumpy road to success \u2014 and a good one for entrepreneurs to take away from this film. By the time Walt created Mickey, he was on his fourth animation company and it is the one that stuck: Walt Disney Studios.\n\nStories behind famous business feuds\n\nThroughout history, businesses have feuded for a variety of reasons. Sometimes these conflicts become epic and can drive businesses to the brink \u2014 or propel them to new heights.\n\n5. Ford v Ferrari \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nIn the 1960s, automaker Ford's then-president Henry Ford II tried to buy luxury sports car manufacturer Ferrari, but the deal fell through at the last minute. Ford v Ferrari stars Matt Damon and Christian Bale and chronicles how Henry Ford II's disappointment turned into revenge, prompting him to create a new car that could beat Ferrari's model at Le Mans, the world's oldest active sports car endurance race.\n\nWhat to watch for: Consider how Ferrari executives don\u2019t take Ford seriously as a competitor, and the impact that has. The movie also shows how Ford\u2019s project passes through numerous middle managers, which likely reduces the overall efficiency of their operations.\n\n6. Adidas vs. Puma: The Brothers\u2019 Feud \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThe movie depicts the story behind two of the world\u2019s most renowned shoe companies, which stems from a vicious family feud that not only pitted two brothers against one another but also divided the inhabitants of their small hometown in Germany. Note: this is a German-language film with English subtitles.\n\nWhat to watch for: The rivalry between these two brands went far beyond corporate competition, but it also undoubtedly pushed both companies to excel. The movie shows how different business approaches resulted in the development of two of the most powerful sports brands in the world. It ultimately begs the question: If it weren\u2019t for this family rivalry, would these companies be where they are today?\n\nThe story behind the world\u2019s largest fast-food chain\n\nThere\u2019s no doubt that McDonald\u2019s is the largest fast-food chain in the world and has revolutionized our eating habits \u2014 for better or for worse. The origin story behind McDonald\u2019s offers great insights into how innovation is born when people are willing to think outside the box to solve customer problems.\n\nThe McDonald\u2019s empire we know today exists largely because of a man whose last name is not McDonald. In 1948, the McDonald brothers debuted a revolutionary kitchen assembly line during a time when drive-ins were still king. Enter Ray Kroc, who delivered several milkshake mixers to the McDonald brothers in 1954. Kroc was in awe of what they had created, and he had a vision for how he could take their \u201cgolden arches\u201d from coast to coast. Kroc eventually bought the business \u2014 and the rights to the McDonald\u2019s name. Today the company is worth more than $100 billion, and Kroc is considered its founder.\n\nWhat to watch for: Not only does the movie show how important it is to never give up; it also throws light on other aspects of business, such as the importance of having a good team, and why it\u2019s crucial to have all legalities in place.\n\n8. The Real Founder \u2013 watch for free through Amazon prime\n\nThe Real Founder features an interview with Dick McDonald, who, along with his brother Maurice, started the McDonald\u2019s restaurant chain. Dick McDonald offers his side of the story, describing how they opened a drive-in restaurant in Southern California, which became one of the most popular in town.\n\nWhat to watch for: If you\u2019ve seen The Founder, this documentary will give you a different perspective. The Real Founder offers the backstory on how the McDonald brothers came up with their own innovations to speed up food service, and even began franchising the restaurant long before Ray Kroc was part of the story.\n\nStories of women inventors who succeeded and failed\n\nThe key elements of success often come down to having drive, ambition and talent; however, as these movies show, you need to back that up with a solid product that performs as advertised.\n\n9. Joy \u2013 rent through Amazon\n\nThis movie captures the challenges of a woman entrepreneur and has a wonderful message for all women looking to build a successful company. Joy is based on the life of Joy Mangano, a self-made millionaire who created a business empire.\n\nWhat to watch for: This movie is about beating all odds and breaking the glass ceiling. But the best lesson here is that if you want to build a big, successful company, you need to get ready to go to war every day, rain or shine. Success means being willing to fight a multi-front battle.\n\n10. The Inventor: Out for Blood in Silicon Valley \u2013 watch for free through Amazon Prime\n\nThis documentary follows the story of Elizabeth Holmes, founder of Theranos, a blood-testing startup business. She led the public to believe that her device, the Edison, could perform dozens of blood tests with just a single finger prick. She was later criminally charged because it was all a lie.\n\nWhat to watch for: Holmes was gifted at creating a narrative that pulled people in and made them want to believe her. Entrepreneurs can learn from the way she masterfully drew investors to back her. But she also refused to listen to anyone who questioned her practices. Successful entrepreneurs listen to feedback and encourage open and thoughtful dialogue.\n\nRelated: 10 Movies All Entrepreneurs Should Watch on Hulu", "author": ["Deep Patel"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/DAYayu1NQ9c/348153", "published": "2020-05-16T15:30:00", "title": "Embracing Your Creativity in Uncertain Times", "text": "May 16, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWith every product and every service, there are so many unknowns.\n\nWill people purchase my product or service?\n\nIs it the right time to launch?\n\nDo I have the experience to take this to market?\n\nDo I have enough money to launch this business?\n\nIs the market ready for this product or service?\n\nEvery entrepreneur with a new product or service has to navigate through uncertainty. It's truer now than ever.\n\nTiming is important, but no one ever truly knows when the right time is.\n\nWill you have enough money? In most situations, no. Will you be able to find the financing you need? Many times, no.\n\nWith every product and every service, there are so many unknowns. Which is another way of saying, there\u2019s always risk.\n\nRelated: To Get Through COVID-19, Entrepreneurs Need to Embrace These 2 Truths\n\nAs a lifelong entrepreneur who has licensed products and built businesses in different industries, I know the feeling well. But one instance comes to mind in particular.\n\nMany years ago, a good friend visited my office to ask me if I could design some new guitar picks.\n\nI thought, Is he for real? I didn\u2019t know anything about guitar picks. Sure, yes, I liked products. But given the chance, why would anyone choose that business specifically? Guitar picks were pieces of plastic that sold for pennies. And I knew nothing about the music industry.\n\nHis timing was good, though. One of my inventions had recently stopped producing royalties for me, my wife wasn\u2019t working, and we had just moved into a new house. So truthfully, my back was up against the wall. I had some extra time on my hands, and it wasn\u2019t clear how I was going to pay our mortgage.\n\nIn times like these, you have to trust yourself. Your best creative work can happen in uncertainty.\n\nGiven the circumstances, my attitude was: \u201cSure, why not?\u201d That\u2019s the right attitude to have when it\u2019s time to get creative.\n\nSo, I jumped right in and began designing our first line of guitar picks. Guitars made me think of rock \u2019n\u2019 roll, which was sexy. Bingo, I thought: Women in bikinis. Guitar picks were curvy, like bodies. (Looking back, I cringe.)\n\nBut, as it turns out, my initial instincts were completely off. These picks didn\u2019t sell at all. When I placed a display with samples in a few local music stores, no one bought them.\n\nEvery successful entrepreneur is familiar with failure, having received more than a few rejections. And sure enough, this was one of mine.\n\nI realized that I hadn\u2019t studied the marketplace. At the time, I was 50 years old. What did I know about youth culture? I needed to study the social trends of a younger audience. So I went down to my local mall in Modesto, California, and walked into Hot Topic. I saw skulls everywhere! And that\u2019s when inspiration hit.\n\nI was going to design a new guitar pick in the shape of a skull. I even came up with a great name: The Grave Picker.\n\nWhen I looked into how guitar picks were packaged, I discovered they were often sold in jumble, stored behind the counter in a tackle box. I realized I could stand out by packaging my product differently too.\n\nBasically, guitar picks weren\u2019t lifestyle. They were utilitarian.\n\nIf I could design uniquely shaped picks that appealed to the lifestyles of different consumers, my market would be much larger than just guitar players. I would be able to sell picks to music fans.\n\nThat hunch bore out. In less than four years, we grew Hot Picks, our company, into one of the largest sellers of guitar picks in the world. Walmart, 7-Eleven and music stores everywhere ended up selling our picks.\n\nRelated: Every Era Brings Challenges. If You Don't Forget Your 'Thing,' You Will Prevail.\n\nTo land retailers that didn\u2019t normally even sell picks, we had to overcome uncertainty. I remember walking into my local 7-Eleven and asking if I could try to sell my picks there by leaving a display on the counter over the weekend. The manager told me he didn\u2019t think they were going to sell, but he agreed to let me try. By Sunday, the picks were gone \u2014 they had sold out!\n\nWe marketed our picks in novel ways too. At the time, the social media platform Myspace was just becoming popular, and we took full advantage of it by sponsoring garage bands with free merch and free advertising. In time, their fans became our army of fans.\n\nTaking a chance on yourself pays off, especially when your back is up against the wall. This is what I\u2019ve learned about harnessing through uncertainty.\n\n1. There\u2019s power in observation. Learning from what you can observe around you is key. You may think you have a good idea, but you should never rely on an assumption. What are consumers actually doing?\n\n2. To minimize risk, test your hunches on a small scale first. We were able to produce a small run of our first designs. When they failed to sell, we lost a little bit of money, but not much. That made going back to the drawing board to come up with a different set of designs easy.\n\n3. Think differently. Simply changing how guitar picks were designed allowed us to sell to a much larger market. Stores that normally didn\u2019t carry picks sold multiple styles of our designs.\n\n4. Pick the right partner. While I knew nothing about the music business the day my friend walked in the door, he was a musician who had owned two music stores. He knew distributors and the trade shows, which helped us tremendously. (Crucially, he knew how to collect money from accounts that were late.) Pick your partners carefully. If you don\u2019t have firsthand knowledge of an industry, find and partner with someone you trust who does.\n\n5. Be unafraid to break the mold. You have to take a chance on your creativity. Not having firsthand experience was actually an asset for me in this situation. I was able to think about guitar picks differently because I didn\u2019t play guitar. I let myself be creative and have fun.\n\nI\u2019ve never forgotten the times when my back was up against the wall, rent was due and I had to try something new. That's why, through feast or famine, my work ethic never wavers. Every entrepreneur launches a product in an uncertain time.

Charisma. Character. Collaboration. So much of what builds personal brands and reputations focuses on human connection and interaction. But how can we maintain relationships when we\u2019re apart?\n\nThe coronavirus pandemic hit us all, in every corner of the world, in real and unexpected ways. Previously, we built engagement with others through eye contact, image, conversation and relationship. Now we find ourselves isolated and conversing with our cats, dogs and children instead of prospective clients, networking contacts, students, audiences and co-workers.\n\nBuilding or maintaining reputation without in-person interaction\n\nToday, it is still critical to be concerned with our reputation and brand as we navigate the new normal. These six tips can help.\n\n1. Virtual meetings. We are all undoubtedly familiar with the virtual meeting tools available today. Are you using them? Seeing a human face gives us an additional layer of connectedness over a phone call or email. We get to see the person\u2019s eyes and get a glimpse of their environment. We can read tonality in their voice differently than without these visual cues. I\u2019ve recommended to my clients that have remote teams that they do a daily \u201cstand up\u201d check-in by video. Each morning, they do a quick group meeting to facilitate conversation and engagement as they discuss what they're working on, call out any roadblocks they\u2019re facing and focus on goals for the day. This keeps continuity in the team and ensures everyone feels supported. I\u2019ve heard of groups doing virtual coffee meetings, virtual happy hours and more. We can\u2019t forget the power of a smiling face, even if we can\u2019t physically be in the same room.\n\nFor virtual meetings, ensure your video presence represents your presence accurately. Will you take the video call from a bedroom, garage, kitchen table or home office? Check the background of your environment \u2014 not to sterilize and depersonalize it, but rather to ensure there is nothing inappropriate or distracting. One case I heard of involves a sales professional who began taking video calls with international clients and forgot to remove several pinup posters in the background. He was speaking with a very conservative client and the client was disturbed by the posters in the background. Another IT specialist did video calls with a client in a bikini top, as she was grounded at her beach house. These are simple steps you can take to ensure your visual reputation is intact.\n\nRelated: 9 Ways COVID-19 Is Like Running a Marathon\n\n2. Voice calls. Similarly, if given the option of an email or a phone call, try calling. It\u2019s likely the person you\u2019re attempting to reach is at home, maybe at their desk or managing their children\u2019s schoolwork (if they are suddenly home schooling). A phone call \u2014 even a short one \u2014 gives us human connection. Warmth, compassion and empathy can be communicated differently on a call than an email.\n\n3. Social media. The online space offers us a compelling place to gather, albeit not in person. The flow of information and insight is constant and global. While it will never replace in person human interaction, social media offers some unique ways we can leverage our strengths, help others and come together as a global community.\n\nRelated: When Your Business Runs Out of Your Home, How Do You Restore Work-Life Balance?\n\n4. Share your resources. Do you have skills, talents, experience or work you can share online? There\u2019s a mathematics professor in California offering to tutor college students online for free. A musician in Nashville offers free concerts to lift spirits and entertain. A neighbor posts an offer to run to the pharmacy for her neighbors. Personally, I reached out to former and current executive coaching clients offering free sessions if they need it to help them manage their businesses. Many of us are mentoring military veterans who are trying to transition to a civilian career in a completely chaotic civilian work sector.\n\nAs you share your resources, consider connecting your offer to your \u201cwhy\u201d \u2014 your values. Personal branding and reputation are anchored in values, and without them, offers are meaningless. The neighbor who says she\u2019ll run to the store for neighbors adds, \u201cI believe it\u2019s important to help those who are at risk.\u201d The professor offering tutoring services adds, \u201cWithout learning, we are nothing as a society.\u201d And the musician who performs concerts on live-streamed platforms says, \u201cWe come together as a world through music. And I was gifted with the ability to help, so I am.\u201d Adding your value statement to your offer creates greater meaning, without depreciating the offer. Authenticity is key here \u2014 the value must be real and not opportunistic. Values, after all, are your moral operating system.\n\n5. Share your humanness. What are you feeling and experiencing? We all see the posts of individuals scared and lonely. We also images of empty (or fully stocked) shelves and the meanings those images are meant to imply. In all of the ways we share content online, we are sharing our humanness and insight into what we believe and value. Some people offer continuous posts of meaningful scripture to remind their followers that the Bible shows the way out of this situation. Others use humor and levity to help their online community release some stress and smile for a moment.\n\nHowever you share, remember that human beings are sharing human thoughts and emotions, and other humans are reading them. Consider how you\u2019ve presented yourself online in the past and whether it\u2019s appropriate and necessary for you to post more authentic, heartfelt messages at this time.\n\nFor example, a client of mine is a mental health specialist. She works with a specific population who regard her as strong, competent and knowledgeable. In the past, this reputation has empowered her to give hearty and meaningful advice meant to help her community navigate their unique circumstances. She\u2019s rarely shared her own feelings or fears. Today, as her small audience blends into the larger community of people struggling with broader mental health issues, she finds herself speaking differently. We\u2019ve broadened her messaging to ensure she\u2019s not professing academic advice and protocols, but rather is sharing her feelings and concerns, along with real recommendations for those listening. This step took a lot of faith for her to do: She was reluctant to speak about herself for fear it could dispel her credibility. In fact, as she has shared more, and pulled other colleagues into the conversation with her, she\u2019s found her clients and audiences grow and appreciate the trust she placed in them to share her story. Her personal brand stands on helping others. In these times, she is helping others by sharing her vulnerability and enlisting the support of others to grow strength in her community.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways to Find Opportunity in a Crisis\n\n6. Share carefully. I\u2019ve noticed several colleagues sharing inflammatory information, and while I have to believe their intent is good, the message can be harmful. In some cases, the information is later proved untrue. Or the information upsets followers who are trying to remain calm. Social media has become a news source and a respite from daily life (especially when we get a lens into the lives of famous people, access to concerts, museums, and other art forms we otherwise couldn\u2019t visit, and can hear from leaders who might otherwise stay quiet). Social media offers access to information and inspiration to help keep us grounded and proactive in our own response to current situations. Online posts that gaslight panic are not helpful, and it could be argued that when we find our new normal after the pandemic has resolved, reputations of those who stoked the flames of these fires could be negatively impacted, if they aren\u2019t already.\n\nYour reputation is about more than you\n\nWhat do you care about? If you are moved to action during this time, consider sharing your ideas online so others can be inspired to do the same, or can help you. Many people are struggling to find ways to support and help and protect others. If you have ideas, consider it your obligation to share those. From fostering shelter animals to donating blood to offering free coaching, how can you help? The goal is not to get gold stars for your efforts, but rather to inspire, influence and impact others to help as well. That is the greatest way to build reputational equity and help the world at the same time.

But that isn\u2019t necessarily a bad thing. Let me explain. Good names are usually only good in the rearview mirror. At the time they are created, they seem risky and sometimes dumb. Are Google and Apple inherently good names, or do they have the benefit of a rosy rear view? Probably the latter.\n\nTerrible timing has certainly contributed to a difficult start for the Jeffrey Katzenberg-founded mobile-video platform, which launched earlier this spring. Still, maybe it isn\u2019t just the timing. Maybe they made bad decisions. Maybe the product doesn\u2019t fit. A name should be judged based on how well it matches the company\u2019s criteria, not on public perception. Because, as mentioned, success shades how we perceive the company, not the strength of the name. Phil Rosenzweig calls this tendency to be biased by success The Halo Effect.\n\nRelated: Brad Flowers\u2019s The Naming Book is available now from Amazon | Barnes & Noble | IndieBound.\n\nA company that raises nearly $2 billion should plan for success. They certainly planned a naming strategy with that in mind. The criteria assumed rapid adoption in the U.S. and quick adoption abroad. Quibi is purpose-built for travel. It feels familiar in the UK with its close tie to the slangy quid. You can imagine the French embracing it as \"Kee-bee,\" similar to Quebec. It is at home in Arabic and Hindi. The alternating consonant/vowel, consonant/vowel construction is reminiscent of one of the most well-traveled brands, Coca-Cola.\n\nHowever, those positives aren\u2019t positive in the current light. If the naming strategy assumes rapid usage in the U.S. and that doesn\u2019t happen, the international flair puts up barriers to a skeptical stateside audience with more time on their hands than usual. The primary obstacle is unclear pronunciation.\n\nWe have all been in a bar and become interested in an exotic beer, only to order the IPA because we didn\u2019t know how to pronounce the other one. Same with a dish in a restaurant or an author in a bookstore. People, in general, don\u2019t like to look stupid, and few things make you feel as stupid as saying something incorrectly.\n\nThere are a couple of ambiguous points in Quibi. I mispronounced it before I heard someone say it. Rhyme is one of the factors that improve memorability in a word; maybe I was trying to force it into the name. Also, the decision to end the name in \"-i\" rather than \"-y\" makes the word look more French. I found myself saying \"Kee-bee\" as I was reading to myself. It feels more snappy, more energetic and in-line with quick snippets of content.\n\nThe second hangup is with the tagline. Currently, it reads: \u201cQuick bites. Big stories.\u201d That leads you to think the name is a blend of the words quick and bite. But, as the reader, you quickly reconsider this because pronouncing it \"Kwi-bye\" doesn\u2019t seem right. It doesn\u2019t feel or look right, and you are left a little confused. If you combine quick and big, you get closer to the right pronunciation, but quick and big aren\u2019t as meaningful as quick and bite.\n\nI will admit to Googling the name to figure out its pronunciation. There were several videos, which probably isn\u2019t a good sign. The name is intended to be pronounced like \"Quimby\" without the -m, which is the last point of confusion. With this pronunciation, you would expect the more standard English spelling of Quiby.\n\nRelated: Elon Musk's Boring Company Completes Excavation of Las Vegas Tunnels\n\nAll is not lost, though. Defying expectations can be a good thing. The result is memorability. The more you have to think about the name, the more likely you will be to recall it. If Quibi can overcome launching in a pandemic by providing users with great content, and assuming it can move quickly abroad, then I think we will all be looking back in 10 years thinking: \u201cDamn, Quibi is a really great name.\u201d If not, I am afraid it will end up with the Nova in the dustbin of misunderstood and misremembered names that we don\u2019t like because the product didn\u2019t live up to our expectations.", "author": ["Brad Flowers"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/Z2Ewz2gZtow/350256", "published": "2020-05-15T18:30:00", "title": "5 Ways Entrepreneurs Can Rebound After a Crisis", "text": "May 15, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nThe current pandemic is dramatically impacting American small businesses and entrepreneurs.

Not only do recessions accelerate cost-saving changes in business models, but they also necessitate completely new business models to best serve the ensuing \u201cnew normal.\u201d\n\n2. Strengthen your core.\n\nThe wonderful thing about technology is that it allows us to do more with less. It also allows us to do more of what we\u2019re good at while automating and/or outsourcing the rest. Since COVID-19 has proven the benefits of remote work, it will naturally accelerate our evolution toward a knowledge and skills-based economy. In this model, entrepreneurs can access more outside expertise more quickly than ever before, and even on-demand.\n\nRelated: 3 Fundamentals for Building a Resilient Supply Chain\n\nHistorically, entrepreneurs have been hindered by wearing too many hats. The old belief was that, in order to cut costs and conserve resources, startups should do everything in-house. For many, this in-house model correlated with the old school prioritization of in-office collaboration \u2013 the idea that, in order to maximize trust, value and efficiency, you need \u201cbutts in seats.\u201d This belief persisted, even in the years leading up to COVID-19.\n\nYet many startups don\u2019t need many (if any) butts in seats, and some companies might never get up off the ground without remote, distributed work teams. Post-pandemic, it won\u2019t matter if you have all the necessary expertise on staff, as long as you have quick access to that expertise. And, as many businesses become more digitally complex, they\u2019ll need to rely more on remote talent from around the world.\n\nThis way of the future will free more creative visionaries to found world-changing businesses without necessarily having or even staffing niche technical expertise. Utilizing new platforms that provide quick, on-demand access to talent around the world, founders can focus on the core day-to-day functions that keep their business running.\n\n3. Adopt a millennial mindset.\n\nIn 2018, millennials already represented the largest generation in the U.S. workforce. Conditioned to work with digital tools like Zoom and Slack, \u201cGeneration Nice\u201d also embraces more compassionate . With up to 71% of millennials seeking a \u201csecond family\u201d at work, entrepreneurs who lead with empathy stand the best chance of maximizing their teams\u2019 potential.\n\nThis post-pandemic business world will prioritize human capital alongside advancing technology because millennials know that you cannot program creativity. Millennial leaders also recognize that, despite the Soylent-drinking Silicon Valley stereotype, millennials reject the old top-down mentality that professional success means working yourself to the bone while sacrificing your relationships with friends and family.\n\n4. Let work stem from life.\n\nMany who have been furloughed or shifted to remote work are spending more time with their families. And though many of us have been conditioned to view our personal lives as separate or even detracting from our professional success, true entrepreneurs know that some of our best creative ideas stem from our essential, everyday experiences.\n\nRelated: 8 Ways the Crisis Will Forever Change the Future Workforce\n\nAny entrepreneur who\u2019s taken a work break can attest to the way their mind and body literally detox. When you\u2019re out of the game, you have the opportunity to clear your mind and begin to operate on a more empathetic and understanding level. Learning how to access this more relaxed and benevolent mindset is absolutely key to successful entrepreneurship because it optimizes your ability to creatively solve problems.\n\n5. Learn how to recover.\n\nIf you\u2019re always responding to challenges with anxiety or aggression, people will be much less likely to pitch creative ideas to you. They\u2019ll be much less likely to pull you into spontaneous Zoom meetings to brainstorm if they don\u2019t think you\u2019re open to new, potentially disruptive ideas. Often, the only way to develop a more open and receptive leadership style is to pull yourself out of the fight and take time to relax and recover.\n\nUsing downtime to establish effective recovery strategies can help you rebound stronger in your next professional pursuit. Whether through meditation, exercise, or both, taking the time to recover in the way that best clears your head and leaves you feeling the most refreshed will pay dividends now and in the future, when you\u2019re back in the thick of work stress.\n\nLearning how to promote your own wellbeing will not only improve the health of your personal relationships \u2013 it will also deepen the connections you build with your colleagues. And when your core team feels respected and cared for, they\u2019ll work extra hard to take care of your customers, and your profits will take care of themselves.", "author": ["Danny Beckett Jr."]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/latest/~3/NJr8Edd7nzI/350637", "published": "2020-05-15T18:30:00", "title": "This Entrepreneur Started Her Business to Offer Meals to New York City Hospital Workers", "text": "May 15, 2020 2 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn early April, Stacy Rotner launched GratiFoodNYC, a grassroots initiative dedicated to sending gratitude through food.

As we strode confidently into 2020, global stock markets where on highs \u2014 of course, around that same time, the World Health Organization became aware of a string of pneumonia-like illnesses in Wuhan. The rest, are fully, painfully, up to date on. The global economy is in paralysis, necessitating huge interventions by government and leading to significant job losses.\n\nEven the mighty Google is reportedly looking at ways to find efficiencies, cutting marketing budgets as well as initiating hiring freezes. Startups are also increasingly sharply in focus, with many that were previously flying high now in a fight for survival.\n\nRelated: Why Progressive Leaders Focus On Playing the Long-Game\n\nAccording to Crunchbase, 280 startups laid off 21,609 employees from March 11 to April 21. Eventbrite, the global ticketing and experience platform has announced a $100 million annualized expense reduction plan, reducing its global workforce by 45 percent together with other cost-saving measures. Coming only a short time after Amazon's potential investment in online delivery business Deliveroo being provisionally approved by the UK competition watchdog, reports emerged that Deliveroo is set to cut hundreds of employees, struggling with lower demand during the lockdown.\n\nAnother eye-catching story was StockX laying off 12 percent of its workforce. This should serves as a warning on how fast things can change; StockX was valued at $1 billion as of July 2019, and as recently as an March 27, the CEO of the \"stock market for things\" mentioned it had benefited from the events over the last few months. However, in a statement to Business Insider, StockX said it was now shifting from a \"growth-focused mentality to one rooted in operational efficiency.\" Clearly it is a time for all businesses to face into our new reality \u2014 things are changing quickly.\n\nWhat is operational efficiency?\n\nLet\u2019s be honest, the concept of operational efficiency probably didn\u2019t come up too often in your management team meetings pre-crisis. Operational efficiency measures the efficiency of profit earned as a function of operating costs; the greater the operational efficiency, the more profitable a company is, generating greater income or returns for the same, or lower costs. One example is lean manufacturing. Adapted from the Toyota Production System, it also refers to the concept of \"continuous improvement,\" a process that seeks to reduce and eventually eliminate inefficiency and waste.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Recognizing a Meaningful Business Opportunity When You See One\n\nOne of its key frameworks, 5S, is named after five activities derived from the Japanese words seiri, seiton, seiso, seiketsu and shitsuke \u2014 to sort, straighten (or \u2018set in order\u2019), shine, standardize and sustain. Interestingly some later adaptions of the model also call for a sixth \u2018S\u2019 for safety \u2014 but hopefully that\u2019s a given right now.\n\nWhen adapted, these principles can prove to be a useful starting point for startups to consider. Operational efficiency does not just need to be focused on reducing headcount \u2014 there are many practical areas to address declining revenues and profits and positives to derive as well.\n\n1. Review your core business functions\n\nIn 5S, the first step of \"sort\" typically refers to the need to remove all unneeded items, only retaining what is needed for efficient production. This reduces distraction and the time required to look for something, increasing the amount of available, useful space. Take this time to review your business activities end-to-end. Do you have areas that are not (yet) core to your business survival? Can they be paused for now?\n\n2. Realign resources to your core business\n\nConnected to the above, this is also an opportunity to realign and focus your team on the areas of greatest return for your business.\n\n3. Are you returning to the same scale of business?\n\nConsider your own \"space\" when things return to normal. Most of us reading this have been working with a distributed team for some time now, so do you still need all of your office space? Perhaps this new way of working can enable you to reduce your costs.\n\n4. Review your workflows\n\n\"Set in order\" in 5S refers to making workflow smoother through establishing specific locations, quantities and order of parts needed for efficient operation. Look at your internal process for completing different types of task with an efficiency focus. How they might be improved?\n\n5. Partner review\n\nDo you have multiple companies offering similar services to you or point solutions in different parts of your business? Single or integrated solution might enable you to reduce cost. Equally, consider if you still need enterprise scale solutions you selected for growth.\n\n6. Identify hidden areas of waste\n\nIt may be a while since you\u2019ve audited your business supply and procurement. Now is the time to look to reduce waste in your business (e.g. SaaS services you are subscribed too that you can do without or can reduce to the free for now).\n\n7. Finish off those projects\n\nIn 5S, shine or shining represents inspecting your workplace and tools on a regular basis in order to improve efficiency, safety and prevent errors and defects. Consider if this is a time to finally get onto refining things that you\u2019ve never finished as you intended, such as long overdue software enhancements or addressing that backlog of technical debt. This will also improve the robustness of your core product.\n\n8. Standardize processes and KPIs\n\nSeiketsu refers to implementing visual displays and controls to standardize processes to making them part of daily routine. Do you agree, manage and monitor your key principles of working currently? Are your team clear on their responsibilities? Use this time to establish stronger KPIs and targets for creating efficiencies in your company.\n\n9. Bring the team into the process\n\nShitsuke also translates to \"do without being told,\" and focuses on maintaining operational efficiency through continued training and total employee involvement. As a startup, you might already be working in an agile, self-organized manner, but take this as an opportunity to bring your team into the review process, explaining why this is important for survival.\n\n10. Training and skills improvement\n\nAs you reorganize, seek input from your team to identify improvements \u2013 ideally incentivize them for offering suggestions. Ask them how they would suggest you reduce costs and innovate without impacting customer experience.\n\nTempering your growth ambitions and implementing an authentic-feeling culture of continuous improvement is not going to happen overnight, but hopefully some of the ideas covered here will spark ideas to help you becoming a leaner business as we all recover from this period. Gaining improvements in productivity, customer value, team morale and employee engagement, as well appropriate cost reduction will ultimately improve your business agility and operating model and lead to greater profitability. Be transparent and seek input \u2013 you just might find some game-changing improvements.\n\nRelated: 5 Steps to Help Your Business Emerge Stronger From the Health Crisis", "author": ["Geraint Evans"]}]}, "entrepreneur_marketing": {"rss": "http://feeds.feedburner.com/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing", "link": "https://www.entrepreneur.com/topic/marketing", "articles": [{"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/-LnqDpTYbmg/348139", "published": "2020-05-15T15:30:00", "title": "The 17 Best Content Marketing Books You Can Read Right Now", "text": "May 15, 2020 8 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nAre you looking to up your content marketing game right now? Are you tired of seeing the same on everyone\u2019s \u201cbest of\u201d list? Me too.\n\nDon\u2019t get me wrong, those books are good, and some are even classics, but content marketing is always evolving. You must keep up with what\u2019s new and exciting in the field so you can apply it to your business, no matter how big or small you are.\n\nSo, I decided to take a deep dive into the newer content marketing books that have been released in the last couple of years. I\u2019ve gathered the best 17 books on content marketing that\u2019ll help you be a better marketer, strategies, and business owner.\n\n1. Content Marketing by Gavin Turner\n\nTurner\u2019s book is a step-by-step guide on how to set up your business with proven strategies that\u2019ll help grow your brand and business. It\u2019s filled with useful tactics you can use in both the short-and long-term to ramp up your marketing, boost content recognition and production and how to tie it all together.\n\n2. Dreyer\u2019s English: An Utterly Correct Guide to Clarity and Style by Benjamin Dreyer\n\nA fresh alternative to the dull grammar and writing books out there, Dreyer\u2019s English was written by a long-time copy chief at Random House Publishing. It\u2019s an engaging and fun look at words and grammar that anyone will appreciate, no matter if you\u2019re new or a veteran marketer. Use it to answer your questions about when to use a semicolon or em dash and why it\u2019s okay to start a sentence with \u201cAnd\u201d or \u201cBut.\u201d\n\n3. F#ck Content Marketing: Focus on Content Experience to Drive Demand, Revenue & Relationships by Randy Frisch\n\nOnce you get past the title, this book is an excellent resource for content marketers. Frisch, the CMO and co-founder of Uberflip, wrote it to help marketers focus more on the way content is experienced, rather than simply pumping it out. His main idea is that marketers have worried too much about content production and not enough about content scalability. It\u2019s an interesting read and one that can help marketers surface their content in the never-ending chronological scroll that is our online world today.\n\n4. Marketing Rebellion: The Most Human Company Wins by Mark Schaefer\n\nSchaefer wrote this book because he knows that the marketing landscape has changed dramatically. Consumers have so many ways of avoiding ads on TV, their browsers, and social media streams that marketers have no choice but to change their tactics. In the book, Schaefer advocates that marketers take a more effective and human approach to their messages. He explains it all clearly and outlines actionable steps that all marketers can take to move forward.\n\n5. Mean People Suck: How Empathy Leads to Bigger Profits and a Better Life by Michael Brenner\n\nThis book was published at a time when interest in the customer experience is more critical than ever, and job dissatisfaction is at an all-time high. Negativity can seep into any business from anywhere, so Brenner explains the benefits of empathy at work, and how it can help people be better outside the office too. Brenner\u2019s filled the book with stories of companies that were able to replace toxic cultures and dissatisfied customers with helpful, positive employees that delivered high-quality customer experiences.\n\n6. Superfans: The Easy Way to Stand Out, Grow Your Tribe, and Build a Successful Business by Pat Flynn\n\nFlynn wrote this book to help entrepreneurs build a more engaged, loyal audience, and explains why a smaller, more loyal audience is better. Superfans makes the case that we should be thinking more about connecting with our audiences on a deeper level through extra-special moments that \u201ccreate novelty, defy expectations, and break the mold.\u201d\n\n7. Talk Triggers by Jay Baer and Daniel Lemin\n\nBaer and Lemin do an excellent job of writing about an often overlooked aspect of content marketing in this book \u2014 word of mouth marketing. Most marketers don\u2019t have a strategy for this particular marketing channel, so they created one. Their \u201c4-5-6\u201d learning system will help you uncover and activate talk triggers in your business. They\u2019re such good writers that this well-organized book explains a complex topic without being overwhelming.\n\n8. They Ask, You Answer by Marcus Sheridan\n\nSheridan\u2019s popular book got an update last year, with new sections on closing deals with video marketing and the essential elements every good business website should have. He also included new stories of businesses who\u2019ve used these tactics to great success, lending even more proof to the fact that this strategy works for everyone.\n\n9. Conversational Marketing by Dave Gerhardt and David Cancel\n\nDrift co-founders Cancel and Gerhardt wrote this book as the definitive book on how to generate better leads and close more sales with chatbots. Conversational Marketing explains how chatbots are transforming the way brands market themselves and interact with customers. It\u2019s a well-written and digestible primer on how to convert a business from traditional communication channels to the modern messaging apps we all use today.\n\n10. Killing Marketing: How Innovative Businesses Are Turning Marketing Cost Into Profit by Joe Pulizzi and Robert Rose\n\nIn this follow-up book to an earlier classic, Pulizzi and Rose explain how today\u2019s innovative companies are achieving remarkable results by fundamentally changing their approach. They\u2019ve dramatically increased customer loyalty and revenue by creating more value for customers by using owned media and changing to a customer-centric way of thinking about content. Pulizzi and Rose write in an engaging, easy-to-read manner that makes it enjoyable to learn more about this new take on content marketing.\n\n11. Crisis Ready: Building an Invincible Brand in an Uncertain World by Melissa Agnes\n\nInformation moves fast today, and many marketers aren\u2019t ready for when things go wrong. Since marketers are often involved in PR and crisis management for today\u2019s modern brands, it makes sense that they learn a bit more about how to handle bad situations. Agnes focuses more on being proactive rather than reactive in her book, helping brands anticipate threats so they can handle them with resiliency and poise.\n\n12. The Lead Machine: The Small Business Guide to Digital Marketing by Rich Brooks\n\nWhile not about content marketing specifically, this book can help entrepreneurs and small business owners develop strategies to manage the digital marketing channels they\u2019ll use to distribute their marketing. It walks you through the steps to create a social media strategy, explains how to increase SEO, add subscribers to your email list and convert loyal fans into customers.\n\n13. This Is Marketing: You Can\u2019t Be Seen Until You Learn to See by Seth Godin\n\nSeth Godin has written several wonderful books on marketing, and his latest is another great entry. In it, he breaks down how to tap into conversations with your audience and engage them with marketing that matters to them. He teaches you how to craft content that speaks directly to your audience, builds trust with them, builds a product or brand they\u2019ll care about, and how to use storytelling as a powerful marketing strategy. Another great read from Godin.\n\n14. Marketing Made Simple: A Step-by-Step StoryBrand Guide for Any Business by Donald Miller\n\nIn keeping with the storytelling theme, next is Donald Miller\u2019s latest book about using his StoryBrand framework for any business. Here, he offers a five-part checklist to help marketers and business owners apply his StoryBrand messaging framework to key customer touchpoints to develop, strengthen, and communicate their brand\u2019s story. Companies that use his methods see double-digit increases in engagement and sales numbers, so if you\u2019re interested in the nuts-and-bolts of it all, this book\u2019s for you.\n\n15. Traffic Secrets: The Underground Playbook for Filling Your Websites and Funnels with Your Dream Customers by Russell Brunson\n\nAs more people jump into entrepreneurship, they must learn how to generate traffic and fill their sales funnels; otherwise, no one will hear about your amazing products that could make a difference in their lives. Traffic Secrets will help you discover and understand precisely who your dream customers are, find where they are online and create the hooks that\u2019ll grab their attention and bring them to your business.\n\n16. SEO 2020 by Adam Clarke\n\nSEO is always a moving target as the search engines change their algorithms. In this updated version of the book, Clarke explains how to do SEO today, dives into the details of what Google\u2019s changed in their algorithms and explains how to use them to your advantage.\n\n17. Top of Mind by John Hall\n\nStaying top-of-mind is the ultimate goal for a brand. You want to be the one consumers remember when they\u2019re ready to buy. In this book, Hall reveals how consumer expectations have changed and what that means to brand owners and how to build a helpful, authentic brand that serves others more than it serves you.

But creating a second act for your business journey will help you prepare for the inevitable, while creating a stream of income your business desperately needs.\n\nEntrepreneurs must fulfill the needs and emotions of their audience in different ways than before. Business owners need to be sensitive to the current situation in order to provide necessary value and an engaged response from customers.\n\nHere are four suggestions for entrepreneurs to creating a pivot strategy during the current crisis:\n\nRelated: 5 Ways to Pivot Your Business During a Crisis\n\n1. Create a digital offering that fits consumers\u2019 needs and emotions now\n\nIf you are a service-based business or if you work off of retainers from your clients, creating a new service that aligns with the feelings of your clients is something that will set you apart from others who are continuing traditional efforts. Analyzing the current mental state of the client will help you customize your offer to something that will sell and help fulfill the need for what your client wants.\n\nOffering something such as one-on-one strategy calls and new ways for clients to tackle the current situations with their will provide more clarity to the entrepreneur as an individual. This clarity can then help them build a more reliable brand.\n\n2. Increase content and create more on digital media platforms\n\nSocial media usage has shown a massive spike in numbers when it comes to users utilizing newer and current platforms during this pandemic. The creation of content on platforms is critical for Entrepreneurs because it gives them the opportunity to showcase thought leadership.\n\nIn addition to the content on social media, creating content utilizing digital media platforms such as podcasts, YouTube videos, and even Tik Tok can communicate necessary value to new and current consumers. The latest platform, Tik Tok, has over 500 million users worldwide, and creating visually appealing content can help create a funnel for entrepreneurs to gain new customers.

Create online digital experiences that replicate in-person emotions\n\nWhile most, if not all, business events have been canceled, the first step of is rescheduling events and keeping the in-person event ideas alive for when it is safe to have them. However, in the meantime, creating the digital event, roundtable, or conference as if everyone was actually in-person can assist in driving conversations of business development and defining the next steps in an entrepreneur's journey. Platforms like hopin.to and bluejeans.com create great in-person vibes for events, conferences, and intimate workshops as well that work towards creating an engaging experience.\n\n4. Build new relationships that can foster new monetary partnerships\n\nA brand or business's relevance through awareness during this time of crisis is significant because maintaining a relationship with your consumers will drive genuine conversations that can turn into partnerships and potentially sponsorships that give more value to your audience.\n\nDirect messages, one-on-one zoom calls, and think tanks are great ways to start conversations. Simply saying \"how can I help you?\" can lead to a new business partnership.\n\nUltimately business is an odyssey, so when the current crisis is over, having an exit strategy that moves you forward is essential. Even if it's just going back to the same business model as before.\n\nLikewise, strengthening new and existing relationships is vital, because on the other side of this, consumers and partners are going to remember who was there for them.\n\nRelated: How to Become a Brand, Not an Employee", "author": ["Andrew Nguyen"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/H9Btak43CC8/350643", "published": "2020-05-14T19:15:00", "title": "Free Webinar | May 27: How to Increase Sales and Find New Customers While Working From Home", "text": "May 14, 2020 1 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nCOVID-19 has changed the way we do forever.

So this begs the question: how does your businesses\u2019 blog stand out? Unfortunately, the answer is not simply to publish good articles \u2013 that\u2019s true, but not enough. We live in the age of information overload; for every question, there\u2019s bound to be five people with an answer. Crafting blog posts that will gather the attention of viewers and draw more traffic is going to require a bit more work. But don\u2019t be afraid! It won\u2019t involve staring for hours at your laptop screen in your pajamas (or your WFH quarantine outfit of the day). To enhance your blogs, it\u2019s going to require some added thought beyond posting, that doesn\u2019t mean you need to adopt the life of a full-time influencer. As you implement techniques to enhance traffic, you\u2019ll find they do a lot of the work for you \u2013 meaning less time on your part. I\u2019ve compiled a list of my favorite pro tips and ideas from other experienced bloggers to help you propel your blog above the rest. Grab your cup of Dalgona coffee, sit back, and let\u2019s talk blogs!\n\n1. Re-evaluate your niche\n\nRemember when I said there\u2019s an audience for every topic? It\u2019s still true, but the popularity of (or lack of) your topic can actually hurt your blog traffic. To explain, let\u2019s quickly visit your childhood and the story of Goldilocks and the three bears; the porridge was either too hot, too cold, or just right. Just like the porridge, your topic has to be just right in terms of the size of its audience. Choose a topic too large and you may have a difficult time standing out. If you choose one too specific, you could have a difficult time attracting a following. So here\u2019s my advice: if your audience isn\u2019t as large or reachable as you\u2019d like, reconsider your blog\u2019s focus, and adjust it\u2019s specificity accordingly.\n\nRelated: Get One-on-One Expert Help From Entrepreneur NEXT powered by Assemble\n\n2. Adjust posting frequency\n\nMuch like posting on social media, determining your post frequency for your blog is just as crucial. Post too much and your viewers may feel overwhelmed; post too little and they may forget about your blog altogether. There is no universally correct amount of posts that will drive your traffic up \u2013 as fantastic as that would be. Don\u2019t feel as if you need to suddenly churn out five blogs a week! Start slowly, adding an extra post, or even experimenting with one less post. Watch closely how your traffic reacts, and you\u2019ll slowly determine the frequency that will bring in a steady stream of viewers!\n\n3. Feature your most popular posts\n\nMost blog platforms will have a feature that allows users to showcase their most popular posts on the main page; my advice is to use this to your advantage. By showing off some of your most successful posts, this will impress any viewer first arriving at your page, and increase the likelihood that they\u2019ll visit your other posts, as well. Take some time to look through your past blogs and notice which ones received the most engagement and views. By showing off these specific posts, visitors to your blog site will be more likely to return to see similar content!\n\nRelated: How to Start a Blog and Make Money Online\n\n4. Post about your blog\n\nSometimes less is more, but not in this case. Promoting your blog shouldn\u2019t stop once it\u2019s published. Now is the time to tap into your influencer side, and post, post, post! I\u2019ve worked with blog sites at a variety of companies, and if I\u2019ve learned anything it\u2019s that promoting blogs on social media is a surefire way to increase traffic. Provide clickable links to your latest blogs on Facebook and Twitter, and post the website link to your blog in your Instagram bio. Increasing the visibility of your blogs across social media will surely benefit your blog traffic, and demonstrate to your followers that you have more to offer outside of these platforms.\n\n5. Add keywords\n\nHave you heard of SEO? If not, let\u2019s take a quick crash course. SEO means \u201cSearch Engine Optimization\u201d, or optimizing your content so that it ranks higher in search results. One of the easiest ways to dip your toes into SEO is by adding keywords to your content that are currently popular in your niche. For example, if I wanted to write a blog about pop culture, I\u2019d sprinkle in keywords such as \u201cGigi Hadid\u201d, \u201cCharli D\u2019Amelio\u201d, or \u201cTiger King\u201d (all currently trending topics in the celebrity realm). Adding keywords will increase your blog\u2019s chances of becoming more visible in searches on the web, therefore bringing more traffic to your site!\n\nRelated: How to Write a Book (and Actually Finish It) in 5 Steps\n\n6. Follow related blogs for inspiration\n\nThe good news is, you\u2019re not alone. Where there\u2019s one blog about an industry, there\u2019s bound to be plenty more, and that\u2019s not always a bad thing! In fact, there\u2019s no better inspiration than existing content from other businesses and leaders related to your topic. If you\u2019re feeling stuck, or even need somewhere to simply begin your blog, look to others for inspiration. Connect with them. Learn how they became successful with blogging and mold their success tips into creating your own popular blog site. And stay connected! I can guarantee, after years of experience in blogs, there are still moments of feeling stuck despite having a good amount of experience under my belt. When these times come, I turn to the blogs of other established people within the industry. Soon enough, the creative juices flow once again, and they will for you, too.\n\n7. Guest blog posts\n\nHere\u2019s a tip that will give your tired fingers a rest from typing: invite someone else to write a blog on your site. I don\u2019t mean someone random that you meet on the street (but who am I to judge your strategy?), rather someone who is within your industry. In #6, I spoke about how there are many blogs for almost every topic- which means there is also a good bunch of people who are like-minded to you. Tap into this network. Although partnering with your competition can be an intimidating idea, there\u2019s no need to be afraid. Guest blogging can be a friendly way to help one another gain new blog traffic, and introduce your brand\u2019s content to an entirely new audience. By hosting another industry professional\u2019s content on your site, you\u2019ll be able to offer a fresh perspective for your readers \u2013 and keep them coming back for more.\n\nCreating and maintaining a successful blog is no easy feat, and certainly isn\u2019t accomplished overnight. But don\u2019t let those initial feelings overwhelm you; it does get easier over time with a little practice and fine-tuning. Take the time to determine the best plan for your blog, and stick to it as much as possible. The more you put into promoting your blog posts and standing out amongst the sea of competitors, the more views you\u2019ll receive!", "author": ["Entrepreneur Next"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/9wLAEwCksVk/349181", "published": "2020-05-13T21:00:00", "title": "Want to Advertise Your Business on Podcasts? Here's How to Get Started.", "text": "May 13, 2020 4 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nEveryone \u201cknows\u201d that sponsoring podcasts is, quite often, one of the most effective and easiest ways to launch a modern startup and set it on a fast-growth trajectory. Although podcast audience numbers are down slightly during the pandemic, most industry observers predict they will bounce back up once the stay-at-home orders are rescinded and commutes resume.\n\nPodcasting is especially attractive for advertisers, since it enables distribution of content when the audiences want it, wherever they want it and in whatever platform they choose to consume it.\n\nWhen plans are laid to launch a modern campaign, spending money on podcasts is almost certainly going to be strongly considered. According to Triton Digital, a provider of technology for the podcast industry, there are more than 800,000 active podcasts available, with 54 million episodes.\n\nTaking those first few steps in this process can be simple: First, determine the audience profile that makes up your target market. Basic information to include their age range, gender, education, occupation, income level, family situation, geographic location, politics, hobbies and interests, etc. Then, identify the podcast distribution networks that represent which shows reach your target market, and work with those companies' sales personnel to help figure out which specific shows reach the best audience profile within the desired spend or budget.\n\nRelated: 7 Reasons to Add a Podcast to Your Content-Marketing Strategy\n\nVerifying the legitimacy of a podcast is crucial. Have they worked with other well-known advertisers? Do they have known/legit guests, hosts, and/or a legit media brand associated with them?\n\nAccording to Lex Friedman, CRO of Art19, a California-based independently owned podcast company, there are three common mistakes entrepreneurs make with podcast campaigns:\n\nThe first is trying to make a podcast ad sound like a radio ad. \u201cRadio listeners instinctively hit the preset station button to avoid listening to ads. In fact, one of the reasons audiences continue to abandon radio for podcasts is to avoid the endless personal injury lawyer pitches and car dealership owners yelling at them,\u201d says Friedman.\n\nThe second is sponsoring a podcast mainly based on the fact that the decision-maker likes the show, without spending the time and effort to determine whether the show\u2019s audience profile is right for the brand and product. \u201cThe audience profile and your target market may overlap, but not closely enough, or you may just want to support some of your favorite podcasts,\u201d says Friedman.\n\nThe last mistake is being too cautious with your budget. Despite its widespread growth, podcasting remains one of the best options for entrepreneurs with shoe-string budget DIY campaigns, but Friedman says, \u201cDon\u2019t try to \u2018dip a toe\u2019 in podcast advertising and expect to get any results ... or even learn anything useful. If you only have a minimal amount \u2014 a few thousand dollars to invest \u2014 better to wait until you\u2019re able to properly fund a campaign.\u201d\n\nAccording to a survey of 168,500 podcast listeners, the podcast advertising network Midroll found that \u201ccampaigns with ads on five or more episodes result in 39 percent more listener recall than those with just one spot. Running spots on just four episodes improves unaided brand recall by 27 percent compared to running a single ad.\u201d\n\nRelated: How to Promote Your New Podcast: 10 Effective Strategies to Try\n\nSpeaking of spend, podcast ad deals \u201care not that complicated,\u201d says Richard Laermer, CEO of RLM PR. \u201cThere are two fundamental numbers always to consider: the first is the audience number, which gets measured as downloads, the higher the podcast's audience, the more an advertiser pays) The second number is CPM.\u201d CPM stands for cost per 1,000, M being the Roman numeral for 1,000. For podcasts, the 1,000 refers to downloads. When a podcast and an advertiser broker an ad deal, CPM is the number they negotiate. According to Laermer, \u201cgenerally, CPMs range from $25 to $40, and sometimes higher if the podcast is really hot or hits a niche audience.\u201d\n\nAccording to Midroll, 63% of podcast listeners have bought a product they heard advertised on a podcast. Whether the topic is daily news or sports, true-crime, career-booster professional development or obscure historical events, podcasts have become a part of our daily routines, making commutes easier and life more interesting, and represent a prime opportunity to change the way consumers respond to advertising in general.", "author": ["Dave Hochman"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/z7DBnH6vfPU/349942", "published": "2020-05-11T18:00:00", "title": "4 Questions You Should Ask Before Investing in Influencer Marketing", "text": "May 11, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nInfluencer marketing is alive and well. It\u2019s thriving, in fact. According to Mediakix, \"89 percent of marketers have reported that ROI from influencer marketing is comparable to or better than other marketing channels\" they invest in.\n\nStill, I\u2019ll admit, when influencer marketing first became a thing, I wasn\u2019t sure if the trend would last as long as it has. But I\u2019ve been happily proven wrong again and again, as it continues to be a worthwhile channel to invest in for brands of all sizes.\n\nIf you haven\u2019t learned whether influencer marketing can help you connect with new customers, drive sales and grow your business, now is the perfect time to find out. There are now more resources, tools and case studies available than ever before that can teach you everything you need to know to build a successful campaign.\n\nAfter spending part of the year talking with and learning from successful marketers about how to get the most out of working with influencers, I\u2019ve come to believe that there are four main questions every marketer should ask before getting too far along in the process. Those questions are as follows....\n\nRelated: Influencer Marketing Really Is a Game-Changer\n\n1. How well do I really know my customers?\n\nBefore investing in any new marketing channel, it\u2019s important that you take a step back and think about who your customers are and what matters to them. Knowing your customers and their motivations will help you throughout the development of your campaign \u2014 everything from deciding which platform to focus on and which influencer to hire to what kind of content to create and promote.\n\nThere are a lot of different exercises you can go through to put yourself in the shoes of your customers, but one of my favorites is known as empathy mapping. The purpose of an empathy map is to try to better understand what your customers think, how they feel, what they say and what actions they take. It\u2019s similar to a customer persona, but the creation process is often quicker and more collaborative. When you build an empathy map, you can choose who you want to gain insights from. It could be your marketing employees, some of your best and most loyal customers, other employees across other departments at your company or a blended group comprised of all three groups.\n\nBy the end of the process, you should have a better understanding of who your customers are, what their goals are and what they are motivated by.\n\nTo plan your first empathy map exercise, use this helpful step-by-step toolkit from IBM.\n\n2. What message am I trying to send?\n\nYou can hire the most popular influencer in the world, but your efforts are going to be fruitless unless you have a firm grasp on the specific message you\u2019re ultimately trying to send to your audience. Remember: You\u2019re not hiring influencers to sell for you \u2014 at least not directly. Instead, you\u2019re partnering with them to help you build relationships and establish trust with people. To do that, you need to have a clear idea of the message you\u2019re trying to get through to people.\n\nFor example, when Sprint launched a marketing campaign that leveraged influencers, they didn\u2019t make the message all about phones and phone service. Why? Because it\u2019s a message that ultimately won\u2019t resonate with people. Instead of focusing on themselves, Sprint worked with influencers to create a viral video that helped promote their #LiveUnlimited hashtag, which encourages people to follow their dreams and work hard for what they want.\n\nThink about what message you want to send to your customers. What matters to your customers, and what beliefs or motivations could you tap into with the help of the right influencers?\n\n3. What kind of person do I want to partner with?\n\nOne of the hardest truths to understand when you\u2019re new to influencer marketing is that not all influencers are created equal. This was one of the most common pieces of advice I got when talking with more than a dozen experienced marketers who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars hiring influencers to help promote products and brands. Everyone said the same thing: You have to really know who you\u2019re working with and how they can help you.\n\nThings aren\u2019t always what they seem. Influencers can buy fake followers and make themselves appear bigger and more popular than they really are. Some social sites are working to crack down on the problem, but it hasn\u2019t been completely solved yet. You can waste a lot of money hiring people that won\u2019t actually be able to bring any sort of value or ROI back to your business.\n\nThe best way to avoid this is to think of influencers as business partners, not simply people you pay to promote products. A partner will ask questions, seek to understand your customers and your goals and help you develop a campaign that hits the mark. If you reach out to an influencer and all they care about is getting paid, it\u2019s probably worth finding someone else to work with.\n\n4. What will success look like for me?\n\nInfluencer marketing is not a get-rich-quick scheme. It\u2019s not the golden goose that will lead to an instantaneous influx in sales as soon as you hit go on your campaign. That\u2019s why it\u2019s important to think about how else you can track success along the way. You should know before launching a campaign how you\u2019ll measure success. If it\u2019s not immediate and direct sales, what does success look like for you? Maybe it\u2019s related to increases in engagement or website traffic. Maybe it\u2019s a boost in followers. Maybe all you want is to align yourself with a well-known person in your industry that you know your prospective customers like and trust.\n\nRelated: 4 Influencer-Marketing Secrets Entrepreneurs Need to Know\n\nThinking about the bigger picture and all the ways you can measure success will prevent you from getting too discouraged or giving up before you find out what kind of impact influencer marketing can have on your business.", "author": ["William Harris"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/mYaKRAWBCUI/349535", "published": "2020-05-10T20:30:00", "title": "Best Practices for Marketing During and After COVID-19", "text": "May 10, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nA global crisis can either paralyze a marketing team or galvanize it to thrive. In the wake of the COVID-19 pandemic, that\u2019s exactly what we\u2019re seeing: some companies are cutting back on marketing (in some instances, laying off the entire marketing team), while others are being more agile and coming up with interesting ways of engaging their audience during these difficult times.\n\nIf you want to stay in business, you can\u2019t stay idle for long. As a business owner myself, I understand why many entrepreneurs would want to cut down completely on marketing activities. Being conservative feels like the safe choice when there\u2019s uncertainly about how long the crisis will last. But we have to balance financial responsibility with the need to keep consumers informed and engaged when things get tough.\n\nRelated: 5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy\n\nIn fact, long-term studies show that the right approach during economic uncertainty is to increase \u2014 not decrease \u2014 your marketing spend. The last thing you want is to be caught flat-footed and find yourself lagging your competitors when the economy revs up again.\n\nFor the most part, consumers are receptive to some marketing at this time. A recent study from the American Association of Advertising Agencies found that 43% of consumers find it reassuring to hear from brands. In addition, 56% said they like learning how brands are helping their communities during the pandemic. Only 15% said they\u2019d rather not hear from companies.\n\nThat said, marketing during these times requires sensitivity to what\u2019s going on in people\u2019s lives and the flexibility to keep up with swift and swooping changes.\n\nStart with customer empathy\n\nCOVID-19\u2019s impact on consumer behaviors and attitudes cannot be understated. An ongoing study we\u2019re conducting with our sister company Reach3 Insights recently found that 76% have recently picked up new habits, behaviors and routines in the wake of COVID-19. Of those people, 89% said they plan on keeping some of their new habits. Consumers are also trying new products, with 36% planning to continue using new brands they\u2019ve tried after COVID-19.\n\nNow is not the time to rely on assumptions. Any data you have from 6 weeks ago\u2014let alone 6 months ago\u2014is already out of date. As the consulting firm Gartner recently advised, CMOs must be proactive in monitoring changes to customer behaviors and purchasing needs while the crisis is unfolding.\n\nRelated: 3 Tips for Marketing a Service Business\n\nBusinesses must move forward but do so with genuine empathy. Marketers can help C-suite executives take the right action by acting as a lighthouse for consumer understanding. Many companies already have existing Voice of Customer and research programs\u2014these can be leveraged at this time to uncover the emotions underlying people\u2019s shifting attitudes and behaviors. Doubling down on customer engagement and listening programs can help provide insights on how to best move forward.\n\nTell relevant, authentic stories \u2014 and give, give, give\n\nImpressively, some brands have already produced compelling campaigns that speak to the realities of the pandemic. Dove, for example, created a spot shining a light on the courage of health care workers. Some brands, like Budweiser and Burger King, are focusing on social distancing and encouraging people to do their part by staying home. One of my favorites is Sam\u2019s Club, which recently created a 60-second spot thanking its employees and calling them \u201cretail heroes.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s great to see creativity in storytelling at this time, but marketers must push their companies to do even more. This is the time to pay it forward and provide as much value as possible to your customers and communities.\n\nEvery organization and person has the capacity to contribute in their own way. The most important question companies should ask themselves is this: \u201cwhat can I do to help?\u201d\n\nGiving back can take several forms. For instance, J\u00e4germeister is hosting a virtual event to help raise funds for New York restaurant owners. In tech, companies like Apple quickly mobilized their resources to produce much-needed PPEs. In my home country of Canada, big-box retailers such as Loblaw and Save-on-Foods have increased the wages of their front-line staff to show appreciation for their efforts. Following the lead of many software companies, Nike has temporarily eliminated its subscription fees for its app to help people stay fit while quarantining.\n\nThese moves transcend marketing and may not increase sales immediately, but they\u2019ll build goodwill and help drive long-term loyalty. Giving back is simply the right thing to do. The faster the world can beat the COVID-19 pandemic, the better chance all companies have in surviving the crisis.\n\nBe agile for the new normal\n\nSome entrepreneurs and marketers are holding off action, thinking that things will be back to \u201cnormal\u201d in a few weeks or months. I do not hold the same view.\n\nRelated: 4 Ways Solopreneurs Can Strengthen Their Businesses Through Marketing\n\nFor one, some scientists are predicting that some form of social distancing may need to happen until 2022. That\u2019s a long time to put any type of marketing on hold. A more important consideration is the fact that the pandemic will have a long-term effect on the psyche and outlook of consumers. In our own COVID-19 study, 86% of Americans and 81% of Canadians agreed that the crisis will create a new normal and have a lasting impact on society.\n\nRegardless of how long the crisis actually lasts, COVID-19 will forever change the consumer landscape. After this comes to pass, companies can\u2019t go back to their old playbooks. Personas, messaging and even your product strategy may need to significantly evolve for the realities of the post-COVID-19 world.\n\nFor various reasons, some CMOs are hesitant to engage consumers in research at this time. But as Gartner\u2019s Frances Russell points out in a recent article, many marketers who have deployed surveys specifically about COVID-19's impact on customer experience have seen actionable responses. We see this in our own research as well: Not only are people answering our conversational chat surveys, they are also providing detailed selfie videos, which is really helping us and our clients and partners understand the human impact of the pandemic.\n\nThe bottom line is that fresh data and accurate insights have never been more important. In these uncharted territories, relying on instincts alone is dangerous. If you haven\u2019t reached out to your customers in the past month, now\u2019s the time to do so.\n\nWhile it\u2019s important to recognize the uncertainties and fears surrounding COVID-19, don\u2019t let this crisis paralyze you. Enabling your team to really understand your customers and act based on timely insights is key to navigating your way through this crisis both for your marketing team and your company.", "author": ["Andrew Reid"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/bt2wXjB2Y7Y/349386", "published": "2020-05-08T15:50:00", "title": "How to Build an Online Community of Like-Minded Entrepreneurs", "text": "May 8, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nOnline communities are the way of the future: They bring people of all ages, backgrounds and hometowns together over a common industry, skill set or interest. I\u2019ve personally been stunned by the impact of an online community from my own experience. My online Facebook community, Elites Mastermind, has over 85,000 members who unite on a daily basis to discuss ecommerce tips and strategies.\n\nRelated: 5 Tips for Building an Online Community for Your Business\n\nThe impacts are significant.

Thanks to this, and the massive potential for consistent engagement, 74 percent of large companies have created online communities, according to research from Demand Metric. For me, however, it\u2019s about amplifying impact. I believe that anyone who has something to say can create an online community of like-minded entrepreneurs and unite them over a common cause. Here\u2019s how to do so, based on my own experience of what works.\n\n1. Share knowledge for free.\n\nThe core element of our group is sharing information at no cost. These tips cover Shopify, Facebook ads, social media marketing, product sourcing, traffic generation and more. Think about the commonalities among all the members of your group. What are individuals joining the community to learn? What interests them most? What are they hoping to accomplish? From there, create the content you know they want to know. Seventy-three percent of consumers report that they trust a brand when they deliver good quality products and services, according to research by Edelman. This extends beyond what you sell as a brand into what you give the consumer consistently. Quality advice, how-to\u2019s and pieces of value within your community develop trust.\n\nPart of this comes down to defining your niche. Generic entrepreneurship communities can work in theory, but they need strong branding and a strong sense of community to bring all of the individuals together. What aspect of entrepreneurship do you want to unite based on?\n\nRelated: 5 Examples Your Brand Can Follow to Build an Online Community\n\n2. Rely on word of mouth.\n\nI\u2019m often asked if I used paid ads to grow my Facebook community, but the honest answer is that all of it was word-of-mouth marketing. This, too, comes back to sharing value. Think about it: If you were part of a community that was sharing endless value, wouldn\u2019t you share it with a friend? At the very least it might come up in a conversation on business strategies, or you may quote the community in a podcast, article or blog post. Ultimately, this word-of-mouth marketing is stronger for your brand than paid ads, because 92 percent of consumers say they trust recommendations from friends and family over any type of advertising, according to Nielsen research. Give your community members something to rave about to their own communities.\n\nWhen just getting started, don\u2019t deny the power of your own word of mouth marketing. You\u2019ve likely established some trust with a few social media followers, friends or family members. Tell them what your community seeks to do and what you\u2019ll share \u2014 this will get the first batch of members in the door.\n\nRelated: 7 Strategies for Achieving Phenomenal Online Community Growth\n\n3. Engage frequently.\n\nCommunities aren\u2019t worth doing if they aren\u2019t supported consistently. Engage frequently \u2014 if not daily, every other day \u2014 because you will become the heartbeat that keeps the community going. Go into your group for a live video, host an \u201cask me anything,\u201d or even facilitate in-person events to build a sense of community. As membership grows and many start posting on their own, more activity will build. But stepping out and letting the members run the show can convey that you don\u2019t care. You also will miss out on a massive opportunity to establish thought leadership within your community.\n\nIt comes down to empowerment, too. Engagement encourages more participation. Every like and comment on a post makes the poster feel that they should share more.\n\nRelated: How to Create Community Among Your Customers\n\n4. Share in other groups as well.\n\nFinally, it\u2019s important to think of community as something that extends beyond the walls of your Facebook group. I consistently show up in other Facebook groups to share value, because a key part of community building is building relationships outside of the community you already have. The way I see it, everyone benefits: Those who I connect with can then join my community and share their unique perspective and expertise with the group.

No matter your sector, you\u2019re probably going to be dealing with fallout, but there is hope, and there are ways that solopreneurs can still thrive.\n\nCut your marketing back as little as possible \u2014 grow it if you can\n\nWhen a recession hits and money gets tight, many companies decide to cut back wherever they can. Marketing and advertising tend to get hit hard. But did you realize that you might actually be hurting yourself long-term by cutting back your spend?\n\nAs Moz founder Rand Fishkin notes, \u201cDon\u2019t use a sledgehammer, use a scalpel.\u201d Businesses that lower ad spend during a recession tend to see sales fall 20 to 30 percent over the next two years.\n\nMarketing and advertising are the low-hanging fruit if you\u2019re going to tighten your belt, but do it with the mindset of pruning for new growth, not that of a drowning man clinging to a life preserver.\n\nSome studies even suggest that a soft economy may be the best time for businesses to grow their market share. If you\u2019re cutting back while your competitors are pushing ahead, you might lose out once the economy gets back on better footing.\n\nRelated: How to Maximize Your Startup\u2019s Content Marketing Budget\n\nConnect the physical with the digital\n\nSolopreneurs with physical businesses are having a particularly hard time right now as everybody has to stay indoors, but some have been able to pivot by bringing their offering online \u2014 or as online as they can.\n\nKajabi\u2019s \u201cLet\u2019s Build Together\u201d campaign has been collecting stories from its users, and many of them deal with exactly this. For example, dog-training expert Connie Cleveland does 12 live events each year and hosts a two-day live workshop. That part of her business has completely collapsed, but after a recent event was cancelled, she reached out to everyone who had signed up and offered them a month of free membership for her online training business, The Obedience Road.\n\n\u201cI had a lot of people who took me up on that, which is great,\" says Cleveland. \"A month from now, they may drop off or they may not, but at least I got them into the membership site, where they\u2019ll get to know me and what I offer.\u201d\n\nRestaurants that never offered carryout or online ordering are now doing full online rollouts. Physical trainers are doing seminars from their home gyms. The advantage of being a is that you\u2019re more nimble than most businesses. Take advantage of it.\n\nFind a pain point and address it \u2014 immediately\n\nYou\u2019ve probably heard of Warby Parker. The company that put direct-to-consumer eyeglasses on the map didn\u2019t start in good economic times \u2014 it actually started during a recession.\n\nCo-founder Dave Gilboa had to buy a new smartphone and a new pair of glasses around the same time and wondered why the glasses cost so much more than the phone. That thought coalesced into what became Warby Parker, and the rest is history, as they say.\n\nWhy did it succeed? The company provided a product people wanted at a cost below what anyone else could offer. No one to that point had been providing stylish eyeglasses for the price Warby Parker could. While money was tighter, this had a lot of appeal, and it proved resilient when the economy got back on track.\n\nCompanies like Coding Dojo, Stellari and Digital Ocean are pivoting to providing products and services that are required in present circumstances. Some fashion companies are repurposing material to create masks and other PPE, while other tech brands are providing support and free services for hard-hit businesses.\n\nWhen money gets tight and customers are in short supply, you can build a loyal audience by providing real value and helping people. That\u2019s true at any time, but doubly so now.\n\nRelated: Want to Build Better Products? Own Your Customers\u2019 Pain\n\nBe genuinely helpful\n\nCompanies that throw themselves into helping their communities and genuinely aiding people will reap the benefits, whereas a tone-deaf or selfish response will turn them off. The most important thing is to focus on genuine, authentic help first. Be altruistic. The business benefits will follow. Even if it seems like you\u2019re losing out in the short-term, you\u2019ll build relationships, appreciation and customers that will last far beyond this moment.\n\nThat\u2019s the biggest takeaway from this for solopreneurs: Find ways to stay in business, but make sure you\u2019re providing a benefit that people can really use even while cooped up in their houses or dealing with sickness. This situation won't last forever, but how you respond to it will resonate far into the future.", "author": ["Lucas Miller"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/VR6L5NYBxi8/349820", "published": "2020-05-07T16:35:00", "title": "4 Creative Ideas to Supercharge Your Digital Launch", "text": "May 7, 2020 6 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nIn my journey as an entrepreneur, I've had many digital launches: my podcast, my line of false lashes, my books, a personal branding workbook and more. What I\u2019ve learned through each launch strategy and execution process is how important it is to be creative. If you're part of a community of , it's likely that someone is launching something on any given day. As exciting as that is to be part of, it can also be a challenge to stand out from the noise and complete your launch in a way that\u2019s specific to your personal brand and the brand of whatever it is that you\u2019re launching.\n\nRelated: This Creative Production Company Launched Almost 25 Years Ago. Its Ability to Evolve With the Market Kept It in Business.\n\nHere are some creative ideas that I\u2019ve put to the test in my own digital launches (specifically, the launch of my false lash line last year that did quite well) that can help you start thinking outside the box about your own upcoming launch. Remember: The more creative and unique you are in your launch strategy, the more eyeballs your launch will get.\n\n1. Unite with ambassadors to share the launch for you\n\nI firmly believe in \u201cgo big or go home.\u201d I\u2019ve had many launches where it felt like I was shouting into the void with just one post across all my social channels, and when I launched my lash company, I just didn\u2019t want it to be like that. So, I gathered a group of lash ambassadors: people who represented my \u201ctarget market\u201d (in this case, makeup and false lash lovers) who could partake in the launch with me. I sent them two pairs of free lashes, asked them to take photos with the glitter lash box and wearing the lashes, and we all posted at the very same time.\n\nRelated: Learn Graphic Design and Launch Your Own Business\n\nIn addition to the added exposure (and the fun!), it was a chance to see my product in all of its diversity. Each of your ambassadors will use or embrace your product a little differently, and seeing everyone\u2019s creative take together creates a full picture of what your product can do. Given, this was a bit easier for me because it was a product that could be worn, but the same principle applies if you\u2019re launching a book or a program. Can you first do a mini launch on a small beta group and give them your product for free in exchange for their inclusion in your concerted launch efforts? The more you give them creative reign over their posts here, the better.\n\n2. Creative, bold digital assets\n\nIn a digital launch, the more creative you can be with your fonts, color scheme, social media posts and landing page, the better. I was recently talking with Layla Parr, the founder of the Launch Societe, a company that focuses specifically on launches. I loved her language about what she helps female founders do: \u201cCombine her warring energies into a harmonious launch.\u201d\n\nI\u2019m certainly not a graphic designer, but I have been able to create the digital assets for each of my launches. Parr told me that her best advice is to \u201creach for the highest vision for what you want the launch to feel like, then find fonts and colors that can imitate that same feel.\u201d That stuck with me.\n\nRelated: Learn How to Start a Creative Side Hustle as a Photographer\n\nI spent a great deal of time perusing online resources like Creative Market to find fonts that matched my expression. This exploration is important \u2014 I urge you to not just go for the status quo fonts and templates. Make a splash! The bolder the digital assets, the higher the chance that one of your followers will actually pause their mindless scrolling to look at what you\u2019re launching.\n\n3. Make a fun countdown\n\nOnce you\u2019ve chosen your digital assets, create some suspense before you launch. I didn\u2019t tell anyone outside my ambassador group and close friends that I was about to launch my line of lashes. To drum up interest, I posted faded images of me wearing my product in a non-obvious way with the overlaid numbers of \u201c3,\u201d \u201c2,\u201d and then \u201c1\u201d leading up to the launch day. I put the date of the launch in the caption, too. This suspense creates a sense of investment for your audience. The more they can wonder about what's coming and feel excited about it, the more momentous your launch will feel.\n\n4. Host a giveaway\n\nFinally, a few weeks after the launch, consider hosting a giveaway on your social channels to stir up enthusiasm again. Give away anywhere from one to five of your products or seats in your upcoming course, and ask followers to enter by tagging friends and liking the photo. This will enhance your product\u2019s visibility even more. I also found that doing this giveaway was a great way to engage audience members who weren\u2019t initially interested in my product or service in the heat of the launch but would be interested in trying it for free if they won the giveaway. This way, you don\u2019t lose or delay any purchases from people who were going to buy to begin with. It just reignites enthusiasm in the \"middle tier\" of your audience members who need an extra push to invest in your product.\n\nTry these ideas out for yourself, or put your own spin on them. Digital launches are my favorite because there are no boundaries to how creative you can be. Show the world what you\u2019re made of, and make them pay attention. Your launch deserves it.\n\nRelated: 3 Memorable Ways to Launch a Product to Wow Customers", "author": ["Haley Hoffman Smith"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/SQyV6UD4RqI/349969", "published": "2020-05-06T16:30:00", "title": "5 Ways Brands Can Reinvent Their Digital Marketing Strategy", "text": "May 6, 2020 5 min read\n\nOpinions expressed by Entrepreneur contributors are their own.\n\nWe are all doing our best to cope under the current circumstances, and I believe that within adversity lies an opportunity to change, evolve and adapt.\n\nWhether you\u2019re an individual, entrepreneur or brand, the need of the hour is to reassess, rethink and reinvent your approach. While influencers, billionaires and corporations are joining hands to aid those in need, brands need to sustain business activities and simultaneously make a positive contribution to those around them.\n\nI recently spoke with brand strategist Alex McCurry, founder of Astra Media, which is helping businesses, brands and entrepreneurs reinvent their digital marketing strategy. Our conversation inspied me to share the following five ways in which brands can rethink their online strategy and make relevant offerings as we all turn our focus toward .\n\nGo Digital\n\nWith people spending much more time on social media platforms than ever before, brands need to shift focus to their digital operations and look for effective ways to connect, interact and transact with their audience. McCurry says that several brands and large brick-and-mortar retailers are now looking to strengthen their digital presence to sustain operations, be it by leveraging ecommerce or offering special incentives.\n\n\u201cI think companies are beginning to understand the importance of social media and digital presence,\" he argues. \"I think it\u2019s only a matter of time until even the most stubborn executives begin to see the value of these digital tools.\u201d\n\nRelated: How Ecommerce Companies Can Continue Engaging New Customers\n\nBe Compassionate\n\nNow is the time when we must do all we can to help each other. For brands, it is a unique opportunity to think outside the box and create innovative ideas that enable them to come forward and make a difference. \u201cBeing greedy or calloused during times of strife can be suicidal for companies,\" McCurry cautions. \"On the other hand, showing a level of compassion and selflessness can help build long-term customer loyalty.\u201d\n\nAn example that comes to mind is how Bacardi shifted production to supply methanol and help manufacture hand sanitizers. Bacardi has a massive presence online and launched a campaign dubbed #raiseyourspirits, which raised $3 million to support local bars and restaurants who were suffering due to the outbreak.\n\n\n\nRethink Offerings\n\nDuring a global health crisis, there are bound to be rapid changes in both consumer behavior and market dynamics. It is essential to monitor brand communication at all times and quickly adapt to changing circumstances. McCurry points to how Dyson is considering a shift in production to create 15,000 ventilators to help the UK\u2019s Nation Health Service and cope with the pandemic.\n\n\u201cBeing timely and understanding the importance of how market conditions and other changes can affect the relevancy of your product is imperative,\" he says. \"Remaining relevant and self-aware of your product can often determine whether you succeed or not during times like this.\u201d\n\nDyson kept tabs on the situation and chose to make a significant alteration in their line of production. Rather than marketing hairdryers and vacuum cleaners, they decided to change their stance by providing much needed medical equipment, ultimately saving lives.\n\nSupport a Cause\n\nThough business may be slow at the moment, it offers brands the opportunity to reach out to their audience online and initiate new and meaningful conversations. You must understand what customers expect from you as a brand and how it can be delivered.\n\nMcCurry shares an interesting example: Kenneth Cole decided to donate 20 percent of all its online sales to the Solidarity Response Fund created by the World Health Organization. Since everyone is holed up at home, leading gyms and fitness studios are offering free at-home workouts along with video-based guides and tutorials for exercises.\n\n\u201cPeople like to be affiliated with projects that they think are making a difference,\" McMurry reasons. \"The power of philanthropy and social entrepreneurship is huge, as it dramatically increases a consumer's confidence in your brand.\u201d\n\nSolve Pertinent Issues\n\nIt is essential to communicate often and effectively how your brand is helping consumers face challenges. \u201cAll of the compassion and lip service in the world is meaningless without action,\" states McCurry. \"By providing real, tangible solutions, it shows consumers that you truly practice what you preach.\u201d\n\nAs examples, think of how restaurants are now providing customers no-contact doorstep delivery or the way big-box stores like Walmart have allocated special hours for senior citizens, ensuring they can stock up on essentials without any risk.\n\nRelated: The 3 Most Valuable Things Entrepreneurs Can Be Doing for Their Team Right Now\n\n\n\nIn my own experience, sometimes a brand needs to stop thinking about statistics, revenue and returns and start thinking of genuine ways to add value and alleviate current stresses.

Apart from that, however, there are quite a few differences that make marketing a service business more complicated and difficult.\n\nFor one, you can't mass-produce services like you can with products, and the customer\u2019s input is much more pronounced. An uncooperative customer can degrade service quality significantly, unlike products which you can design to be fool-proof. Nonetheless, marketing is a crucial part of success in any service industry and you must get it right. Here are a few tips to do just that:\n\nDifferentiation for initial awareness\n\nUnlike with products where there will be reviews and even the most minute differences will be highlighted to place rank one product over another, most service businesses are similar in what they deliver. So to break into a market, you\u2019ll need to identify one area to center your unique selling proposition around.\n\nIt could be lower pricing, faster turnaround time, or specialization, but there must be something that will make customers consider moving to your service as opposed to the more established firms. After they hire you, you can help them see other ways your service is better, but that initial differentiation is key to landing new customers.\n\nRene Langer, CEO of PICKHVAC \u2014 which developed an online tool to connect contractors and clients \u2014 says that, \u201cWhen trying to establish your presence through pricing, it\u2019s important to be cautious in your approach. Too aggressive and you\u2019ll find yourself relegated to the low-end of the market with razor thin margins, while if you don\u2019t go low enough, you might not be able to turn enough heads to give your business the critical mass it needs. It\u2019s better to focus more on value than on price per se. Use incentives and bundles to make customers understand they\u2019ll get better bang for their buck with you.\"\n\nRelated: 3 Content Marketing Tips for Your Service Business\n\nStellar customer service to gain referrals\n\nNowadays, customer service is one of the most important considerations for any service-oriented business. It\u2019s also a crucial factor in how likely your customers are to refer their friends and family, so getting it right must be a focal point of your marketing efforts.\n\nThe first step is to train your staff extensively to be sure they understand the value of exceptional customer service and how to provide it. Many customers will not bother to report, but bad customer service from any of your staff will leave them determined to stay away from your business in the future. Apart from training, providing great customer support is essential, even after a service has been concluded.\n\nIt\u2019s important not to go overboard though \u2013 you do not want to become that person who is always sending spammy emails and eventually gets blocked. Instead, reach out occasionally with valuable information related to your service. That way, you\u2019ll keep your business top of mind and also ensure that you\u2019re leaving a positive impression for the next time a former client needs the services you provide.\n\nRelated: Video Marketing for Service Businesses\n\nNimble marketing\n\nYour competitors are not going to be sitting still while you come in and take all the customers. It\u2019s likely that over time, they are going to be switching things up as well, especially because service business\u2019 brands are more flexible than product brands.\n\nAnd flexibility is a point in your favor, if you harness it correctly. Be sure to keep an eye on your marketing metrics to see what\u2019s working and what needs to be changed, and it\u2019s crucial to have your social media monitoring in good hands as well so you can respond quickly and appropriately whenever something comes up on social media. If handled astutely, positive or negative feedback can be turned into good publicity for your brand.\n\nOn the whole, marketing a service business is complicated. But when done properly you can come into a market, stake your position, and increase your market share over time.\n\nRelated: 6 Ways Service-Based Businesses Can Market on Instagram", "author": ["Pritom Das"]}, {"link": "http://feedproxy.google.com/~r/entrepreneur/salesandmarketing/~3/eMkRSSyBMic/349932", "published": "2020-05-01T13:00:00", "title": "Make Your Branding and Marketing Content Pop with This Easy-to-Use $30 Digital Illustrator", "text": "May 1, 2020 2 min read\n\nDisclosure: Our goal is to feature products and services that we think you'll find interesting and useful.

On Thursday, Royal Dutch Shell PLC (RDSa.L) cut its payout for the first time since World War Two as part of a plan to save $30 billion to help it weather an unprecedented decline in oil demand.\n\nYet some managers of divided funds - which seek to give their clients exposure to a steady stream of income - believe the beaten-down sector may hold companies that are likely to keep their dividends intact and see their share prices rise.

Remember that benefits are backdated, so if approved, you\u2019ll get back unemployment from the date you applied.

Is there anything else they should be doing?\n\n\u201cThis can be your moment to refine, expand, or even discover talents and skills.

Ask your boss about work sharing as an alternative to layoffs.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Michele Evermore, senior researcher and policy analyst at the National Employment Law Project\n\nWhat benefits are available to contractors or gig-economy workers who have seen their salaries disappear?\n\n\u201cContractors, check with your state to see if they\u2019ve extended benefits.

California also approved contractors to receive benefits through pandemic unemployment assistance.\u201d\n\n\u2014 Raymond Lee, founder and chief executive of Careerminds\n\nAny guidance on looking for a job?\n\n\u201cLean on your network.

REUTERS/Lucas Jackson/File Photo\n\nRest assured there are options, even if they are all expensive.\n\nIf you are losing a workplace plan, you will get paperwork explaining your benefits under the Consolidated Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act, known as COBRA, which allows you to continue on your same plan. The catch is that you have to pay the full amount of the premiums, not just the employee portion.\n\n\u201cThe employer was typically paying 50 to 100% of the cost, that\u2019s why COBRA is so expensive,\u201d said Anthony Lopez, vice president of operations for eHealth.com https://www.ehealthinsurance.com, a nationwide aggregator.\n\nLopez said most people calling eHealth now are looking for other options besides COBRA, and that means going through the state exchanges, private insurance or short-term plans. You can also go to state websites, healthcare.gov https://www.healthcare.gov or directly to insurance companies to find rates for your personal situation.\n\n\u201cPeople are scared,\u201d Lopez said, mostly because they fear they will not be able to get health insurance.\n\nLopez said he was not seeing denials, which is reassuring, but then the fear turns into sticker shock.\n\nThe key to picking the best plan is to figure out if it is better to pay less for the premium, but more of the actual cost of the care through a high deductible - and which level to choose.\n\nThe average monthly premium for 2020 was $456 for individuals and $1,134 for families, according to eHealth\u2019s latest analysis. Deductibles averaged $4,263 for individuals and $7,893 for families, meaning this is how much they would have to pay out of pocket, excluding services like well visits for children, before the insurance starts to pay.\n\nOptions for high-deductible plans have been prevalent for years, even through employer plans, but many would have these costs offset by the employer paying a big chunk of the premium and also contributing a lump sum toward the deductible.\n\nHelp might be available for premium reductions for those who qualify for government subsidies. The math will be a little tricky right now though, because the calculation is based on your last tax return. If you estimate your income based on your job loss, and then you get another job, you may owe a penalty, Lopez warned.\n\nDEALING WITH DEDUCTIBLES\n\nIt is not just Americans facing job losses who have to face the reality of high deductibles because of COVID-19. Those still on their workplace plans, who may have been furloughed but are able to keep their insurance, are having to manage their costs more than ever.\n\nResearchers at the University of Southern California Sol Price School of Public Policy studied what happens financially to people who switch from traditional health plans to high-deductible plans, and found there was a significant increase in out-of-pocket spending and excessive financial burden.\n\n\u201cIf you are healthy and lucky, then a high deductible is a great thing for you,\u201d said Neeraj Sood, a professor at USC who worked on the study.\n\nNone of us is very lucky right now, however.\n\nIn reality, it is very easy to rip through a deductible of several thousand dollars. A couple of trips to urgent care at full price or an afternoon in an emergency room could do it.\n\nEven if the test for COVID-19 is a covered expense, there are all sorts of other costs you could face if you fall ill, and you are on the hook for normal healthcare costs too.\n\nIt takes advance planning to properly deal with these expenses, and that will not be something everyone can pull off with stretched finances.\n\nJeff Hicks, a certified financial planner from Illinois, is one model. He has had a $10,000 family deductible plan for nearly 20 years, and each year religiously puts aside the full amount of the deductible in a Health Savings Account, which is a specialized pre-tax account that also grows tax-free.\n\nFor the first four years, he spent none of it. Then his wife got very sick, and they went the next four years spending the full amount. Since then, they have gone back and forth on the spending.\n\n\u201cOnce she had this catastrophic deal, I knew we were looking at potentially having it every year. I resigned myself to the fact that this may be the path we\u2019re on,\u201d Hicks said.", "author": ["Beth Pinsker", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/news/wealth/~3/0g2D71vYeK8/scaramuccis-skybridge-hit-with-heavy-redemption-requests-as-fund-fell-letter-idUSKCN22634P", "published": "2020-04-24T20:23:18", "title": "Scaramucci's SkyBridge hit with heavy redemption requests as fund fell: letter", "text": "BOSTON (Reuters) - Investors in SkyBridge Capital asked for hundreds of millions of dollars back after the fund suffered a 23% loss in March when investments made by its debt-focused hedge fund managers soured, Anthony Scaramucci wrote in a letter to clients, saying he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by the loss.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Anthony Scaramucci, Founder and Co-Managing Partner at SkyBridge Capital, speaks during the opening remarks during the SALT conference in Las Vegas, Nevada, U.S. May 17, 2017.

In fact, we were in that galaxy just three years ago.\n\nFILE PHOTO: Participants hold signs as Democratic U.S. presidential candidate U.S. Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-VT) speaks at a news conference to introduce the \"Medicare for All Act of 2019\" on Capitol Hill in Washington, U.S., April 10, 2019. REUTERS/Aaron P. Bernstein/File Photo\n\nA higher Medicare age was an awful policy idea when the Republican-controlled House of Representatives pitched it in 2017 (reut.rs/3cjvT01). It was just as bad in various proposals from Paul Ryan to reform federal spending when he ran the House Budget Committee and served as speaker of the House. And just imagine what it could have meant during today's coronavirus outbreak, which disproportionately affects older adults who rely on Medicare.\n\nThe pandemic has made the yawning gaps and inequities in our health insurance system painfully obvious. And until now, the dream of universal health insurance coverage has seemed very distant.\n\nBut last week, presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Joe Biden became the first major-party candidate to call to expand access to Medicare by reducing the eligibility age to 60. This is a remarkable turning point - the standard bearer of a major party actually is calling for significant expansion of a government program. \u201cSuddenly, the government doesn\u2019t seem to be such a bad actor anymore,\u201d said Marilyn Moon, one of the nation\u2019s top experts on Medicare.\n\nMoon is an economist and former public trustee of both Medicare and Social Security. She co-chaired a recent study on ways to expand Medicare eligibility by the National Academy of Social Insurance (NASI).\n\nBiden\u2019s proposal was a concession to the progressive wing of his party aimed at unity for the fall election, and it was a step in the right direction. But the NASI report shows that dropping the Medicare age to 60 would be no more than a very incremental step. A new battle over health reform surely will emerge in the wake of the pandemic, and the outcome we need is universal, affordable health coverage for all that improves the quality of care.\n\nTHREE APPROACHES TO REFORM\n\nThe NASI study bit.ly/2K4Aya7 offers a fascinating in-depth look at three approaches to expanding Medicare eligibility: lowering the eligibility age, establishing Medicare for All, and creating a Medicare buy-in. The report was created by a study panel made up of 27 experts from a broad range of perspectives, such as economics, health policy, political science, sociology, medicine and law.\n\nThe report draws some surprising conclusions about the practicality of actually executing these approaches. Yes, Medicare for All might be the toughest putt from a political standpoint - but the optional buy-in - which sounded great rolling off the tongues of moderate candidates like Pete Buttigieg - actually is the most difficult to execute.\n\n\u201cA lot of people think that Medicare for All sounds nice, but that it is aspirational and very difficult, if not impossible to do in practice,\u201d said Moon. \u201cAnd the buy-in just sounds like it\u2019s not a big change. But we quickly realized that the buy-in was very complicated, because you take a complicated program like Medicare, which has a lot of moving parts, and then the even more complex Affordable Care Act structure and you try to marry the two in some way. It\u2019s very difficult to do.\u201d\n\nMedicare for All could achieve nearly universal coverage, and yield sizable administrative savings. But there are plenty of questions about how exactly it would be executed. These include the continued role - if any - of private insurance like Medicare Advantage, Medigap and prescription drug plans; benefits and cost sharing and financing mechanisms, to name just a few. From a political standpoint, a push for Medicare for All would provoke a donnybrook with the powerful health insurance lobby if it includes an end of commercial health insurance as we know it.\n\nA SWEET SPOT?\n\nReducing the Medicare age might just be the sweet spot, because it is fairly straightforward to implement and might not provoke the same intensity of political opposition.\n\nBut if we want to make a meaningful difference in healthcare coverage in this country, the age would need to move much lower than 60. The NASI study found that an entry point of age 62 would add 10.1 million to the Medicare rolls, but only 670,000 who had been uninsured because this older age group already has a comparatively low uninsured rate. Of course, that figure could be much higher now due to COVID-19-induced job losses.\n\nDropping the eligibility age to 50 would add 57.3 million new enrollees, 4.6 million of whom would have been uninsured. But that would come with its own set of questions. \u201cYou begin to change the nature of the people that are being covered, including many more families with children - but Medicare is an individually based insurance program,\u201d said Moon. \u201cYou also have to figure out whether or not the payment rates that Medicare uses that help make it inexpensive would be adequate for healthcare providers who suddenly would be covering many more of their patients under Medicare.\u201d\n\nA lower Medicare age would come with a few other complications, starting with how to finance the expansion. Medicare Part B (outpatient services) and Part D (prescription drugs) are paid for with a combination of enrollee premiums and government general revenue. But Part A (hospitalization) is financed through a payroll tax paid in advance by workers. The fund's actuarial assumptions are premised on serving only the 65-and-older population, and it already is on thin ice, facing an exhaustion date of 2026. (reut.rs/2RBxUwP) That date will likely move even closer due to the unanticipated cost of\n\ncaring for coronavirus patients.\n\nBiden has proposed to protect the Part A trust fund by financing the expense of serving new, younger enrollees from general revenue, rather than the payroll tax.\n\nIt is far too early in the pandemic crisis to know where this debate will go, and much will depend on the political makeup of Washington next year. But as the saying goes, a crisis is a terrible thing to waste nyti.ms/2ykhKkl.\n\nFor more on Medicare expansion, check out my podcast interview this week with Marilyn Moon bit.ly/3adkttp.\n\n(The opinions expressed here are those of the author, a columnist for Reuters.)", "author": ["Mark Miller", "Min Read"]}]}, "reuters_science": {"rss": "http://feeds.reuters.com/reuters/scienceNews", "link": "https://www.reuters.com/news/science", "articles": [{"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/ih_pijsP-ik/star-trek-not-star-wars-nasa-releases-basic-principles-for-moon-exploration-pact-idUSKBN22R2Z9", "published": "2020-05-15T20:26:09", "title": "'Star Trek, not Star Wars:' NASA releases basic principles for moon exploration pact", "text": "WASHINGTON (Reuters) - NASA on Friday set the stage for a global debate over the basic principles governing how humans will live and work on the moon, as it released the main tenets of an international pact for moon exploration called the Artemis Accords.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The full moon, also known as the Supermoon or Flower Moon, rises above the Statue of Liberty, as seen from Jersey City, New Jersey, U.S., May 7, 2020.

The Artemis Accords, consistent with the Trump administration\u2019s space policy, appear to clear the way for companies to mine the moon under international law and urge countries to enact similar national laws that would bind their private sector\u2019s space operations.\n\n\u201cWhy would private companies take the risk of going to mine resources if the legal situation was they could be kept from owning them?\u201d Lori Garver, former deputy administrator of NASA, said to Reuters. \u201cSo anything this does to clear any of that up could really help advance progress in space development.\u201d\n\nCHINA AND RUSSIA\n\nReuters reported earlier this month that the administration of U.S. President Donald Trump was drawing up the Artemis Accords.\n\nIn response, Russia\u2019s space agency chief Dmitry Rogozin criticized Washington for excluding Russia from early negotiations over the space exploration pact, drawing parallels with U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East.\n\n\u201cThe principle of invasion is the same, whether it be the Moon or Iraq. The creation of a \u2018coalition of the willing\u2019 is initiated,\u201d Rogozin wrote on Twitter. \u201cOnly Iraq or Afghanistan will come out of this.\u201d\n\nChina said it was willing to cooperate with all parties on lunar exploration \u201cto make a greater contribution in building a community with shared future for mankind,\u201d a spokesperson for China\u2019s foreign ministry said in a statement faxed to Reuters.\n\nThe safety zones \u2014 while intended to encourage coordination \u2014 have prompted questions on whether the accords align with the Outer Space Treaty, which states the moon and other celestial bodies are \u201cnot subject to national appropriation by claim of sovereignty, by means of use or occupation, or by any other means.\u201d\n\nThe size of the safety zones would vary depending on the nature of the site they surround and would not constitute appropriation, Bridenstine said.\n\nThey would follow the principle that \u201cbasically says I\u2019m gonna stay out of your way, you\u2019re gonna stay out of my way, and we can all operate in this space,\u201d he added.\n\nHowever, there is a question over who determines the sizes of the safety zones, said Ram Jakhu, associate professor at McGill University\u2019s Institute of Air and Space Law in Canada. \u201cSafety zones are necessary, but they can also be abused in a way that it may become appropriation.\u201d\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\nBut Mike Gold, NASA\u2019s associate administrator for international relations, told Reuters the language on moon mining shouldn\u2019t worry other nations.\n\n\u201cThe principles that are being put forward here is nothing that we believe any responsible spacefaring nation would disagree with,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cVia the Artemis Accords, we hope that the future will look a lot more like \u201cStar Trek,\u201d and a lot less like \u201cStar Wars\u201d by getting ahead of these issues,\u201d Gold said.", "author": ["Joey Roulette", "Min Read"]}, {"link": "http://feeds.reuters.com/~r/reuters/scienceNews/~3/f1W5hMoINek/statins-may-help-older-coronavirus-patients-avoid-symptoms-covid-19-more-than-respiratory-illness-idUSKBN22R2WA", "published": "2020-05-15T19:22:41", "title": "Statins may help older coronavirus patients avoid symptoms; COVID-19 more than respiratory illness", "text": "NEW YORK (Reuters) - The following is a brief roundup of some of the latest scientific studies on the novel coronavirus and efforts to find treatments and vaccines for COVID-19, the illness caused by the virus.\n\nFILE PHOTO: A computer image created by Nexu Science Communication together with Trinity College in Dublin, shows a model structurally representative of a betacoronavirus which is the type of virus linked to COVID-19, better known as the coronavirus linked to the Wuhan outbreak, shared with Reuters on February 18, 2020.

Among 154 coronavirus patients at two nursing homes, those who took a statin, such as Lipitor, were nearly three times more likely to be free of symptoms during their infection than those who did not, researchers in Belgium found. There was also slight trend toward lower risks for lengthy hospital stays and death that was not statistically significant. The study was not randomized, so more formal trials are needed to definitively prove that statins affect outcomes. \"In the current absence of other valuable therapies and considering the benefit-risk balance, an older person living in a nursing home could consider taking a statin if at high COVID-19 infection risk,\" the authors advised. The study, reported on Friday on the medRxiv website, has not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2X3K57g)\n\nCOVID-19 is not just a respiratory disease\n\nThe desperate need of severely ill coronavirus patients for mechanical ventilators to help them breathe had led many people to think of COVID-19 primarily as a respiratory disease, at least in adults. But among nearly 5,500 coronavirus patients in the largest New York health system, more than one in three hospitalized COVID-19 patients developed acute kidney injuries, and nearly 15% required dialysis, researchers reported on Thursday in the medical journal Kidney International. Other research teams have reported that the virus can infect cells in the small intestine. And on Wednesday, researchers reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that autopsies of 27 people who died of COVID-19 showed the virus in tissues of 17 hearts, 17 livers, 8 brains and the kidneys of 13 people. There have also been reports of the virus causing blood clots that can lead to strokes. ( bit.ly/3fYw9o3 bit.ly/2Z6KXLe)\n\nConvalescent plasma is safe but not conclusively proven to help\n\nResearchers around the world are studying whether hospitalized coronavirus patients can be helped by infusions of blood plasma from people who have recovered from the virus, so-called convalescent plasma. It is not yet clear whether or to what extent convalescent plasma provides benefit, but a large study shows the treatment is safe. U.S. researchers analyzed data from 5,000 hospitalized adults with severe or life-threatening coronavirus infections who received the treatment as part of a U.S. FDA Expanded Access Program for convalescent plasma for COVID-19 patients. Fewer than 1% of patients had any serious adverse effects in the first four hours after transfusion, researchers found. The findings, published on Thursday on the medRxiv website, have not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/2AA7hml)\n\nFlu data can help coronavirus case estimates; less reliable for deaths\n\nOne way to get a better sense of how the coronavirus spread in the United States, researchers suggest, is to look at U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data on the number of people with flu-like symptoms and estimate how many of them were actually diagnosed with the flu. The ones who were not may have had coronavirus infections instead. Researchers looked at the number of prescriptions for oseltamivir, an antiviral specifically used to treat influenza. According to their report on Friday in the journal Clinical Infectious Diseases, when they compared the CDC-reported flu-like illness levels with their estimate of actual flu diagnoses based on oseltamivir prescriptions, they concluded that by April 4 there were already more than 2.5 million coronavirus cases in the United States. (bit.ly/2AAm2Wh)\n\nOn the other hand, flu mortality estimates are not a helpful tool for comparing the deadliness of the flu and the coronavirus, a separate report says. Most people do not realize that CDC numbers for influenza deaths are just estimates, whereas COVID-19 deaths numbers are actual counts, Dr. Jeremy Faust of Brigham and Women's Hospital in Boston told Reuters. Writing in JAMA Internal Medicine on Thursday, he and a coauthor say that between the 2013-2014 and 2018-2019 flu seasons, the estimated annual number of flu deaths ranged from 23,000 to 61,000 - but over the same period, the yearly number of counted influenza deaths was between 3,448 and 15,620. In contrast, during just the week ending April 21, 2020, there were 15,455 U.S. COVID-19 deaths reported.

REUTERS/Russell Cheyne\n\nExperts in the field - known as wastewater epidemiology - say that as countries begin to ease pandemic lockdown restrictions, searching sewage for signs of the SARS-CoV-2 coronavirus could help them monitor and respond to flare-ups.\n\nSmall early studies conducted by scientific teams in The Netherlands, France, Australia and elsewhere have found signs that the COVID-19-causing virus can be detected in sewage.\n\n\u201cMost people know that you emit lots of this virus through respiratory particles in droplets from the lungs, but what\u2019s less well known is that you actually emit more small virus particles in faeces,\u201d said Davey Jones, a professor of environmental science at Britain\u2019s Bangor University.\n\nThis suggests that on a wider scale, sewage sampling would be able to estimate the approximate number of people infected in a geographic area without having to test every person.\n\n\u201cEvery time a person becomes infected with COVID-19, they start shedding virus into the sewer system,\u201d Jones said. \u201cWe\u2019re using that (knowledge) and tracking people\u2019s toilet movements.\u201d\n\nThe practice has been used to monitor health threats and viral diseases before.\n\nIt\u2019s a crucial tool in the global fight to eradicate polio, and scientists in Britain and elsewhere also use it to monitor antibiotic resistance genes from livestock farming.\n\n\u201cWastewater epidemiology has been part of monitoring of polio infection across the world, so it\u2019s not completely new,\u201d said Alex Corbishley, a veterinary scientist at the Roslin Institute in Edinburgh who is running a three-month pilot project to track SARS-CoV-2 in wastewater in Scotland. \u201cBut it\u2019s never really been applied to an outbreak in this way.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe idea here is that you could potentially use this as a relatively cheap, but much more importantly, scaleable, way of saying \u2018there\u2019s X amount of transmission\u2019 in a community.\u201d\n\nNOT INFECTIOUS\n\nScientists conducting initial COVID-19 sewage studies in Europe and Australia stress that what they are picking up is not live, infectious virus, but dead particles or fragments of the virus\u2019s genetic material that are not infectious.\n\nIn a pilot trial in Queensland, Australia, scientists were able to detect a gene fragment of SARS-CoV-2 in sewage from two wastewater treatment plants.\n\nIn the Netherlands, sewage epidemiologists acted ahead of the COVID-19 outbreak there and took samples from seven cities and a major airport in February and March.\n\nWhile they found no detectable virus three weeks before the first COVID-19 case was detected, by March 5 - barely a week after the first case was confirmed there - they were able to detect virus fragments.\n\n\u201cThe detection of the virus in sewage, even when the COVID-19 prevalence is low, indicates that sewage surveillance could be a sensitive tool to monitor the circulation of the virus,\u201d the researchers wrote in a paper posted online on MedRxiv.\n\nResearchers in Paris posted findings in April that showed how sampling wastewater in the city for a month tracked the same curve of the rising and falling epidemic there.\n\nSlideshow (7 Images)\n\nFew countries have the resources or capacity to test each person individually, with most only able to test healthcare workers or people with symptoms severe enough to mean they need hospitalisation.

Using laser light scattering, researchers studied the small droplets that linger in the air after exiting the mouth. Based on earlier research into levels of the virus in oral fluid, they estimate that one minute of loud speaking could generate more than 1,000 virus-containing droplets that would remain airborne for at least eight minutes. \"There is a substantial probability that normal speaking causes airborne virus transmission in confined environments,\" Philip Anfinrud and Adriaan Bax of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda, Maryland and their coauthors conclude. (bit.ly/3fJIRqp)\n\nTwin antibodies may be better than one\n\nScientists have found twin antibodies that neutralize the new coronavirus, each by slightly different mechanisms. Finding a way to use both antibodies simultaneously might be a particularly good way to attack the virus, the researchers say. According to their report on Wednesday in Science, the two antibodies were isolated from a patient who recovered from COVID-19. Both work by attaching to a spike on the virus that helps it break into human cells. Because the antibodies each bind to different places on the spike, a \"cocktail\" containing both may be more effective than a treatment using either one by itself. The information could also help in development of a preventive vaccine, the laboratory experiments suggest. Furthermore, even if the virus mutates so that one of the antibodies no longer works, the other might still retain its neutralizing activity. (bit.ly/2WsbD7b)\n\nChildren with cancer may be no more vulnerable to the coronavirus than healthy kids\n\nChildren with cancer do not need to delay treatment for fear of becoming more vulnerable to the new coronavirus, according to a study reported on Wednesday in JAMA Oncology. \u201cIt was reassuring that they didn\u2019t appear to be any more vulnerable than other children,\u201d Dr. Andrew Kung, coauthor of the study and head of pediatrics at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center in New York, told Reuters. \u201cWith this information we can now feel confident to forge ahead with cancer therapy and not delay out of fears of affecting susceptibility to COVID-19.\u201d\n\nAmong children with cancer but without symptoms of coronavirus infection, only 2.5% tested positive for the virus, researchers reported. Among those who had been exposed to the virus or had symptoms suggestive of infection, 29.3% tested positive, with only one requiring hospitalization. Altogether, the team tested 178 children and 74 adult caregivers for the virus. Among the children\u2019s asymptomatic caregivers, 14.7% turned out to be infected. \u201cEven in that setting, we found that just half of the time when a caregiver was positive did the kid also test positive,\u201d Kung said. \u201cThis suggests that there is something about kids that makes them less susceptible not just to the development of symptoms but to the infection itself.\u201d\n\n(bit.ly/3cuDM3j)\n\nScientists find cheaper way to study coronavirus genome\n\nResearchers have found a simpler, cheaper way to sequence the coronavirus genome, a crucial process that allows researchers access the genetic information in the RNA of the virus. \"This approach builds on ongoing sequencing efforts by other groups but bypasses time consuming and costly steps in preparing samples for sequencing,\" Daryl Gohl of the University of Minnesota Genomics Center, who led the research, told Reuters. \"The ability to sequence SARS-CoV-2 at low cost and at large scale will aid in the genomic surveillance of (the virus) for public health efforts, and has the potential to accelerate studies on the influence of viral genetics on transmissibility, virulence, and clinical outcomes.\" The paper describing the new method was posted online on Tuesday on the bioRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed. (bit.ly/3buhU6A)\n\nCoronavirus particles in feces may not be infectious\n\nThe new coronavirus may not spread via contact with fecal matter, researchers suggest in a report on Wednesday in Science Immunology. In laboratory experiments, they discovered that while the virus does infect the cells of the small intestine, fluid from the large intestine inactivates it, so that the virus is no longer infectious by the time it is excreted in feces. The authors caution, however, that because they only studied fecal samples from 10 patients, they cannot definitively rule out fecal-oral transmission of COVID-19. Their findings also suggest that certain protein-digesting enzymes help the new coronavirus enter cells in the gut. Blocking those two enzymes might be a way to treat the infection, they speculate, especially since a drug that inhibits the TMPRSS2 enzyme is already approved in Japan to treat pancreatitis.

Researchers have found that men have higher blood levels of the enzyme that helps the virus infect cells. The higher levels of \"angiotensin-converting enzyme 2,\" or ACE2, in men's blood might mean their organs have more of the ACE2 \"receptors\" the virus uses to get into cells, researchers suggest in a paper published on Monday in European Heart Journal. Their study involved more than 2,000 elderly men and women with heart failure but no coronavirus infection, many of whom were taking common blood pressure drugs that block the effect of this enzyme, known as ACE2 inhibitors or angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs). The researchers emphasize that study participants receiving these medications did not have higher levels of ACE2, which adds to earlier evidence that the drugs do not increase people's risk for coronavirus infection. (bit.ly/2AgF5Vb;bit.ly/2Ajdl2m)\n\nAdding interferon may boost effectiveness of coronavirus treatment\n\nAdding interferon-beta to a cocktail of the antiviral drugs lopinavir, ritonavir and ribavirin helped alleviate symptoms and shorten the duration of viral shedding (contagion) and hospital stays of mildly or moderately ill COVID-19 patients, according to results of a small randomized trial conducted at six hospitals in Hong Kong. The time it took for at least half the patients to have negative coronavirus tests was seven days with add-on interferon, compared to 12 days without it, researchers reported on Sunday in The Lancet. Overall, 86 patients received the interferon-containing combination and 41 got the antivirals without interferon. When the study started, half the patients had already been symptomatic for more than five days. The combination that included interferon \"also alleviated symptoms completely within four days - a significantly shorter time than the control,\" researchers said, adding that a larger trial to confirm these results is needed.

The study, which was posted online on Monday on the MedRxiv website but has not yet been peer-reviewed, found fewer than 0.5% of all pregnant women were hospitalized with the disease, and only around 10% of those women needed intensive care. Most pregnant women who were admitted to hospital were more than six months pregnant, the study also found.\n\nA separate study from Sweden, however, found pregnant women there do appear to face higher risks. Swedish national registry data, published on Sunday in the medical journal Acta Obstetricia et Gynecologica Scandinavica, showed that compared to nonpregnant women infected with the coronavirus, similarly aged pregnant women with the virus were more than five times as likely to need intensive care and four times more likely to need invasive mechanical ventilation. The authors of an editorial accompanying the study advise that, \"on the basis of available data...the risk of COVID-19 in pregnancy should not be down-played to avoid falsely reassuring healthcare professionals and the public.

British physicians reporting on Thursday in The Lancet said the children initially have fever, rash, conjunctivitis, lower-limb swelling, pain in arms and legs, and \"significant\" gastrointestinal symptoms, even without testing positive for the coronavirus.

Some of the men were already recovering from their illness.\n\n\"If it could be proved that SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted sexually ... (that) might be a critical part of the prevention,\" doctors at China's Shangqiu Municipal Hospital wrote in the medical journal JAMA Network Open on Thursday, adding that more research is needed.

They reanalyzed specimens from patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19 whose test results had been negative or unclear and found less human DNA than they expected to see. Correct use of nasopharyngeal swabs to obtain a high quality specimen \"requires training and expertise as it involves insertion of the swab to ... a depth of roughly 7 centimeters (2.76 inches), followed by rotation and withdrawal,\" Zabrina Brumme of Simon Fraser University in Burnaby, British Columbia and colleagues say.

By contrast, public health measures like social distancing, school closures and sheltering at home do make a difference and were strongly associated with reduced epidemic growth, Dr. Peter Juni at the University of Toronto and colleagues found in a report published on Friday in CMAJ (Canadian Medical Association Journal).\n\n\"The important effect of public health interventions needs to be weighed carefully against potential economic and psychosocial harms when deciding when and how to lift restrictions,\" Juni's team concluded in their report.

Now, as major economies prepare green investments to kickstart growth, advocates spy a golden chance to drag the niche energy into the mainstream of a post-pandemic world.\n\nFILE PHOTO: The new Febus hydrogen bus is seen before a presentation in Pau, France, January 14, 2020. REUTERS/Regis Duvignau/File Photo\n\nGreen hydrogen was pushed to the fore last week when Fatih Birol, head of the International Energy Agency, said the technology was \u201cready for the big time\u201d and urged governments to channel investments into the fuel.\n\nSome countries, including the Netherlands, Australia and Portugal, have already begun investing in the technology. Now investors, politicians and businesses are pushing the European Union and others to use its post-crisis recovery plan to support hydrogen in areas like trucking and heavy industry.\n\nThe promise of hydrogen as a fuel to help power vehicles and energy plants has been a talking point since the 1970s, but it is currently too expensive for widespread use. Proponents say infrastructure investment and more demand from transport, gas grids and industry will bring the cost down.\n\nMost hydrogen used today is extracted from natural gas in a process that produces carbon emissions, which defeats the object for many policymakers. But there is potential to extract \u201cgreen\u201d hydrogen from water with electrolysis, an energy-intensive but carbon-free process if powered by renewable electricity.\n\nEU officials, one of whom described green hydrogen as the \u201choly grail\u201d, said it could replace fossil fuels in sectors that lack alternatives to align operations with the EU\u2019s Green Deal plan to reduce net emissions to zero by 2050.\n\n\u201cHydrogen could solve a lot of problems. We need everything else as well but the political interest is because to achieve deep energy efficiency and decarbonisation, hydrogen seems relatively easy,\u201d said Jesse Scott, senior advisor at think-tank Agora Energiewende.\n\n\u201cIt is less alarming (for policymakers) than some other elements for meeting net zero,\u201d she added, such as carbon removal technology for example.\n\nHYDROGEN GAINING MOMENTUM\n\nMomentum appears to be building; EU industry chief Thierry Breton met hydrogen companies online this week to discuss the bloc\u2019s recovery from the pandemic.\n\n\u201cWe could use these circumstances, where loads of public money are going to be needed into the energy system, to jump forward towards a hydrogen economy,\u201d said Diederik Samsom, who heads the European Commission\u2019s climate cabinet.\n\nThis could result in hydrogen use scaling up faster than was expected before the pandemic, he added.\n\nThe European Commission has earmarked clean hydrogen - a loose term which can include gas-based hydrogen, if fitted with technology to capture the resulting emissions - as a \u201cpriority area\u201d for industry in its Green Deal.\n\nOver the past year, several governments, including Germany, Britain, Australia and Japan, have announced or have been working on hydrogen strategies and the pace has picked up over the past month during the pandemic.\n\nThis week, Australia set aside A$300 million ($191 million) to jumpstart hydrogen projects. Portugal plans to build a new solar-powered hydrogen plant which will produce hydrogen by electrolysis by 2023.\n\nThe Netherlands unveiled a hydrogen strategy in late March, outlining plans for 500 megawatts (MW) of green electrolyser capacity by 2025. A German hydrogen strategy is expected later this month.\n\nThe Dutch government is pushing for the EU to follow suit and present an \u201caction plan\u201d for clean hydrogen, a spokesperson told Reuters.\n\nCAN IT BECOME AFFORDABLE?\n\nWhen it comes to transport, hydrogen fuel cells trail electric batteries in the push for greener cars, given their higher price and the lack of refuelling stations. But proponents see potential for heavier vehicles.\n\nDaimler and Volvo Trucks unveiled plans last month to bring hydrogen fuelled heavy-duty vehicles to market within the decade.\n\nHydrogen gas is already used in industry to produce ammonia, which goes into fertilisers, and methanol, used to make plastic.\n\nA major drawback of the green hydrogen that governments are most interested in, is that it requires a large amount of renewable electricity to produce. The good news is, renewables prices have fallen sharply in recent years.\n\nAccording to Bernstein analysts, hydrogen made from fossil fuels currently costs between $1-$1.8/kg. Green hydrogen can cost around $6/kg today, making it significantly more expensive than the fossil fuel alternatives.\n\nHowever, increased demand could reduce the cost of electrolysis. Coupled with falling renewable energy costs, green hydrogen could fall to $1.7/kg by 2050 and possibly sub-$1/kg, making it competitive with natural gas. Higher carbon prices would also encourage the shift.\n\n\u201cClean hydrogen produced from electricity is around three times more expensive than that from natural gas, but solar and wind costs have decreased in recent years and if they continue to fall, clean hydrogen produced with lower electricity costs would become more affordable,\u201d said Philippe Vie, global energy and utilities lead at consultancy Capgemini.\n\n\u201cOn hydrogen we are right now where we were with renewables in 2000-2005. Ten to 15 years is probably a good time lapse to become competitive,\u201d he added.\n\nMAJOR MONEY NEEDED\n\nAny serious attempt at large-scale use - either in industry or transportation - would also require major infrastructure investments. For example, power from an offshore wind farm would need to be connected to an electrolyser that produces the green hydrogen, which would then need to be transported to end users.\n\nEurope has around 135 MW of electrolyser capacity, but planned green hydrogen projects could bring that to 5.2 gigawatts, according to consultancy Wood Mackenzie. But many projects hinge on further investment partners or subsidies, which advocates fear will be scarcer in the COVID-19-induced economic slump.\n\n\u201cInvestments that would have been foreseen to be done now are not made because production is delayed,\u201d Jorgo Chatzimarkakis, secretary general of lobby group Hydrogen Europe, told Reuters.\n\nTo help lower costs, several projects are being worked on across the gas infrastructure, industry, mining and energy sectors.\n\nRoyal Dutch Shell (RDSa.L) and Dutch gas firm Gasunie unveiled plans in February to build a mammoth wind-powered hydrogen plant in the northern Netherlands, capable of producing 800,000 tonnes of hydrogen by 2040.\n\nIn Germany, oil refinery Raffinerie Heide is embarking on a project using excess wind energy and abundant water supply in the region to produce hydrogen to make kerosene.\n\nSlideshow (2 Images)\n\n\u201cThe price of hydrogen we pay for now is four times natural gas from an external source fed through the pipeline and produced 30 km away,\u201d said CEO Juergen Wollschlaeger.\n\nA big fear for companies in the hydrogen industry is that they will be unable to take advantage of the unique opportunity presented by vast economic stimulus packages, and that governments will favour supporting traditional high-carbon fuel sectors that have been hit hard by a collapse in energy demand.\n\n\u201cFor us, that will be the question to be answered in the next weeks.

Scientists have proposed using membrane technology to separate CO 2 from other gases for natural gas purification and carbon capture, but there are potentially hundreds of thousands of plastics that can be produced with our current synthetic toolbox, all of which vary in their chemical structure. Manufacturing and testing all of these materials is an expensive and time-consuming process, and to date, only about 1,000 have been evaluated as gas separation membranes.\n\nKumar and his collaborators at Columbia Engineering, the University of South Carolina, and the Max Planck Society in Mainz (Germany) created a machine learning algorithm that correlates the chemical structure of the 1,000 tested polymers with their gas transport properties, to investigate what structure makes the best membrane. They then applied the algorithm to more than 10,000 known polymers to predict which would produce the best material in this context.\n\nThis procedure identified some 100 polymers that had never been tested for gas transport but were predicted to surpass the current membrane performance limits for CO 2 /CH 4 separations.\n\n\"Rather than experimentally test all the materials that exist for a particular application, you instead test a smaller subset of materials which have the most promise.

The cool, nutrient-rich water supports life from invisible phytoplankton to the economically important salmon, rockfish and Dungeness crab to the majestic orcas.\n\nA new study led by the University of Washington finds that the animals' ability to breathe in that water may be key to where and when they thrive. The study, published May 15 in Science Advances, uses recent understanding of water breathability and historical data to explain population cycles of the northern anchovy. The results for this key species could apply to other species in the current.\n\n\"If you're worried about marine life off the west coast of North America, you're worried about anchovies and other forage fish in the California Current. Ultimately it's what underpins the food web,\" said lead author Evan Howard, a UW postdoctoral researcher in oceanography.\n\nThe study shows that species respond to how breathable the water is -- a combination of the oxygen levels in the water and the species' oxygen needs, which are affected by water temperature. The anchovy historical data matches this pattern, and it suggests that the southern part of their range could be uninhabitable by 2100.\n\n\"Climate change isn't just warming the oceans -- it is causing oxygen to decrease, which could force fish and other ocean animals to move away from their normal range to find higher-oxygen waters,\" Howard said.\n\nAnchovy populations are known to cycle through time, but the reasons have been mysterious. Other explanations -- that drew on food supplies, predator-prey interactions, competition with other species, and temperature preferences -- failed to fully explain the anchovy populations cycles from the1950s to today, which have been carefully recorded.\n\nadvertisement\n\nSince the late 1940s, the California Cooperative Oceanic Fisheries Investigations, or CalCOFI, a partnership between California state and federal agencies, has monitored marine life and conditions offshore. It was established after the economically devastating crash of the sardine fishery in the 1940s with the goal of avoid another fisheries collapse and better understanding marine populations.\n\n\"They weren't just measuring anchovies, they were measuring everything they could get their hands on,\" Howard said. Because the anchovies are numerous and their populations soared after the sardine collapse, these fish provide a good record over time and space for the past half-century.\n\nPrevious research by the UW group showed that water \"breathability,\" the combined effects of temperature and oxygen levels, are key for marine animals' survival. The 2015 research used models to combine the effects of warmer seawater that can hold less oxygen with marine animals' increased metabolic needs in a warmer environment.\n\nThe new study also drew on a 2018 paper that analyzed the oxygen needs for various types of marine animals at different water temperatures. The two previous studies focused on the future, under climate change, and the distant past, for a major extinction event.\n\nResearchers combined observations with ocean models to fill gaps in the data and showed that the breathability index changes over time and corresponds with when anchovy populations rise and fall, and when they move deeper or closer to shore.\n\n\"This study is the first one that demonstrates on a timescale of decades that a species is responding in really close alignment with this metabolic index -- how breathable the ocean in its habitat has become,\" said senior author Curtis Deutsch, a UW associate professor of oceanography. \"It adds a new, independent line of verification that species in the ocean are arranged in accordance with how breathable their habitats are.\"\n\nThe authors then looked at the extent of anchovy habitat in the future under climate change. Projected changes in the water conditions will likely make the southern part of the anchovies' range, off the coasts of Mexico and Southern California, uninhabitable by 2100.\n\n\"We expect habitats to shift for all species that depend on oxygen for survival,\" Howard said. \"If we understand how these animals are responding to their environment, we can better predict how these populations will be affected as the conditions change.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515144652.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T19:46:52", "title": "Food webs determine the fate of mercury pollution in the Colorado River, Grand Canyon: Floods can shift animal populations, altering mercury passed to fish and other wildlife", "text": "In the Grand Canyon reach of the Colorado River, two species play an outsized role in the fate of mercury in the aquatic ecosystem, and their numbers are altered by flood events. So reports new research, published in Science Advances, that is among the first to meld ecotoxicology and ecosystem ecology to trace how mercury flows through aquatic food webs and then spreads to land.\n\nMercury is an environmental contaminant that occurs in ecosystems globally. In its organic form, it is a potent neurotoxin that can harm people and wildlife. Mercury accumulation in animals and how it magnifies along food chains is well studied. Less well understood are the pathways mercury takes through food webs to reach top predators, such as fish and birds, and how those pathways might change after large ecosystem disturbances, such as floods.\n\nEmma Rosi is an aquatic ecologist at Cary Institute of Ecosystem Studies and co-lead author on the paper. She explains, \"By combining data on mercury concentrations in aquatic life with well-studied food webs, we were able to reveal how mercury moves through an ecosystem. We found that flooding and an invasive species both influenced the flow of this contaminant of global concern.\"\n\nThe traits of organisms living in an ecosystem -- their physiology, what they eat, and what eats them -- determine contaminant movement and exposure. These factors have rarely been included in models of contaminant flux and fate. \"Pairing contaminant concentrations and highly detailed food webs has the potential to improve the management of contaminants in ecosystems,\" Rosi notes.\n\nTo study these pathways, the research team developed mercury-based food webs for six sites spanning 225 miles of the Colorado River, extending downstream from the Glen Canyon Dam in Grand Canyon National Park. Food web sampling took place seasonally over two years. At each site, they measured algae, invertebrates, and fish to determine who was eating what -- and what that meant for mercury exposure at each level of the food web.\n\nInsects (blackflies and midges) and invasive New Zealand mudsnails were the dominant invertebrates in the river. These animals play a vital role in moving energy and contaminants from the bottom of the food web to fish predators at the top. Fish included native Bluehead Sucker, Flannelmouth Sucker, Speckled Dace, and Humpback Chub, as well as non-native species such as Common Carp, Fathead Minnow, and Rainbow Trout.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe stomach contents of invertebrates and fish were assessed to identify what they ate and in what amounts. Algae, detritus, and animals were analyzed for mercury concentrations and, combined with the diet data, the team estimated the amount of mercury that animals were consuming throughout the year.\n\nFood web complexity varied across the study sites. Just below the Glen Canyon Dam, food webs were simple with few species and food web connections. Further downstream, food webs had higher species diversity and more connections. Across the study sites, regardless of food web complexity, relatively few species were key players in the movement of mercury.\n\nAlgae and tiny particles of detritus were the source of 80% of mercury flowing to invertebrates. In sites closest to the dam, invasive mudsnails dominated the food webs. Trout were the only fish in this part of the river, and they are unable to digest mudsnails. Mercury accumulated by the snails did not move up the food chain. Because the snails are fully aquatic, mercury cycled back into the river's detrital food web when they died.\n\nBlackfly larvae were the source of 56-80% of the mercury flowing to fish. Blackflies are preferred prey for fish, such as Rainbow Trout, and blackflies had higher mercury contaminations compared to other invertebrates. Blackflies that escape predation and emerge from the river as flying adults move mercury from the river to land. This can expose terrestrial predators, such as birds and bats, to mercury that started out in the river.\n\nThe amount of mercury that blackflies moved to land was dependent on the number of hungry fish in any part of the river. At some sites, fish ate nearly 100% of the blackfly larvae, leaving few left to emerge. At other sites, there were a lot more blackflies than the fish could eat. When these blackflies emerged as adults, the mercury inside them hitched a ride to terrestrial food webs along the river.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOne year into sampling, the study sites were flooded as part of a planned dam release. The team was able to explore the effects of the flood on mercury movement in the food webs. At sites near the dam, the flood washed away large numbers of New Zealand mudsnails and led to a boom in blackfly populations. With the rise in blackflies, more mercury flowed to trout. Because trout gobbled up nearly all the blackflies in their larval form, very little of the mercury accumulated in these abundant insects was transported to land by the flying adults.\n\nRosi explains, \"Changes to the animal populations in an ecosystem will impact how mercury moves through a food web. This was especially apparent at sites where flooding changed the proportion of blackflies relative to fish. Flooding dramatically altered mercury pathways in the simple tailwater food web near the dam, but not in the more complex food webs downstream.\"\n\n\"Invasive species and dams are common in rivers globally, and both factors were at play in the Grand Canyon reach of the Colorado River,\" Rosi says. \"We found that flooding changed the species present at our study sites, and mercury flow changed with those shifts.\"\n\n\"Understanding the factors that control the movement of mercury through food webs can help resource managers protect ecosystems that are susceptible to mercury pollution,\" says David Walters, USGS scientist and co-lead author of the study.\n\nRosi concludes, \"This study is exciting because it sheds light on the depth of understanding we can achieve when we merge ecological and ecotoxicological thinking. Species traits, animal populations, predator-prey interactions, and disturbance can all influence the movement of contaminants in the environment. Understanding the complex interplay of these factors can improve risk management of animal exposures in the environment.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515144650.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T19:46:50", "title": "Modern sea-level rise linked to human activities: Surprising glacial and nearly ice-free periods in last 66 million years", "text": "New research by Rutgers scientists reaffirms that modern sea-level rise is linked to human activities and not to changes in Earth's orbit.\n\nSurprisingly, the Earth had nearly ice-free conditions with carbon dioxide levels not much higher than today and had glacial periods in times previously believed to be ice-free over the last 66 million years, according to a paper published in the journal Science Advances.\n\n\"Our team showed that the Earth's history of glaciation was more complex than previously thought,\" said lead author Kenneth G.

Continental margins, which include the relatively shallow ocean waters over a continental shelf, can extend hundreds of miles from the coast.\n\nThe study showed that periods of nearly ice-free conditions, such as 17 million to 13 million years ago, occurred when the concentration of atmospheric carbon dioxide -- a key greenhouse gas driving climate change -- was not much higher than today.

After exploiting the capability of the European mobile platform MOLAB in situ and non-invasively at the Munch Museum in Oslo, the researchers came to the ESRF, the European Synchrotron (Grenoble, France), the world's brightest X-ray source, to carry out non-destructive experiments on micro-flakes originating from one of the most well-known versions of The Scream. The findings could help better preserve this masterpiece, which is seldom exhibited due to its degradation. The study is published in Science Advances.\n\nThe Scream is among the most famous paintings of the modern era. The now familiar image is interpreted as the ultimate representation of anxiety and mental anguish. There are a number of versions of The Scream, namely two paintings, two pastels, several lithographic prints and a few drawings and sketches. The two most well-known versions are the paintings that Edvard Munch created in 1893 and 1910. Each version of The Scream is unique. Munch clearly experimented to find the exact colours to represent his personal experience, mixing diverse binding media (tempera, oil and pastel) with brilliant and bold synthetic pigments to make 'screaming colours'. Unfortunately, the extensive use of these new coloured materials poses a challenge for the long-term preservation of Munch's artworks.\n\nThe version of the Scream (1910?) that belongs to the Munch Museum (Oslo, Norway) clearly exhibits signs of degradation in different areas where cadmium-sulfide-based pigments have been used: cadmium yellow brushstrokes have turned to an off-white colour in the sunset cloudy sky and in the neck area of the central figure. In the lake, a thickly applied opaque cadmium yellow paint is flaking. Throughout its existence, several elements have played a role in the deterioration of the masterpiece: the yellow pigments used, the environmental conditions and a theft in 2004, when the painting disappeared for two years.\n\nSince the recovery of the painting after the theft, the masterpiece has rarely been shown to the public. Instead, it is preserved in a protected storage area in the Munch Museum, in Norway, under controlled conditions of lighting, temperature (about 18\u00b0C) and relative humidity (about 50%).\n\nAn international collaboration, led by the CNR (Italy), with the University of Perugia (Italy), the University of Antwerp (Belgium), the Bard Graduate Center in New York City (USA), the European Synchrotron (ESRF, France), the German Electron Synchrotron (DESY, Hamburg) and the Munch Museum, has studied in detail the nature of the various cadmium-sulfide pigments used by Munch, and how these have degraded over the years.\n\nThe findings provide relevant hints about the deterioration mechanism of cadmium-sulfide-based paints, with significant implication for the preventive conservation of The Scream.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The synchrotron micro-analyses allowed us to pinpoint the main reason that made the painting decline, which is moisture. We also found that the impact of light in the paint is minor. I am very pleased that our study could contribute to preserve this famous masterpiece,\" explains Letizia Monico, one of the corresponding authors of the study.\n\nHitting the right formula for preservation\n\nMonico and her colleagues studied selected cadmium-sulfide-based areas of The Scream (1910?), as well as a corresponding micro-sample, using a series of non-invasive in-situ spectroscopic analyses with portable equipment of the European MOLAB platform in combination with the techniques of micro X-ray diffraction, X-ray micro fluorescence and micro X-ray absorption near edge structure spectroscopy mainly at the ESRF, the European Synchrotron, in France, the world's most powerful synchrotron. The study of the painting was integrated with investigations of artificially aged mock-ups. The latter were prepared using a historical cadmium yellow pigment powder and a cadmium yellow oil paint tube that belonged to Munch. Both mock-ups had a similar composition to the lake in the painting. \"Our goal was to compare the data from all these different pigments, in order to extrapolate the causes that can lead to deterioration,\" says Monico.\n\nThe study shows that the original cadmium sulfide turns into cadmium sulfate in the presence of chloride-compounds in high-moisture conditions (relative humidity, or RH ?95%). This happens even if there is no light.\n\n\"The right formula to preserve and display the main version of The Scream on a permanent basis should include the mitigation of the degradation of the cadmium yellow pigment by minimising the exposure of the painting to excessively high moisture levels (trying to reach 45% RH or lower), while keeping the lighting at standard values foreseen for lightfast painting materials. The results of this study provide new knowledge, which may lead to practical adjustments to the Museum's conservation strategy,\" explains Irina C. A. Sandu, conservation scientist at the Munch Museum.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Today the Munch Museum stores and exhibits Edvard Munch's artworks at a relative humidity of about 50% and at a temperature of around 20 \u00b0C. These environmental conditions will also apply to the new Munch Museum to be opened in Spring 2020. That said, the Museum will now look into how this study may affect the current regime. Part of such a review will be to consider how other materials in the collection will respond to possible adjustments,\" adds Eva Storevik Tveit, paintings conservator at the Munch Museum.\n\nCadmium-sulfide-based yellows are not only present in Munch's artwork but also in the work of other artists contemporary to him, such as Henri Matisse, Vincent van Gogh and James Ensor.\n\n\"The integration of non-invasive in-situ investigations at the macro-scale level with synchrotron micro-analyses proved its worth in helping us to understand complex alteration processes. It can be profitably exploited for interrogating masterpieces that could suffer from the same weakness,\" reports Costanza Miliani, coordinator of the mobile platform MOLAB (operating in Europe under the IPERION CH project) and second corresponding author of this study.\n\nMonico and colleagues, especially Koen Janssens (University of Antwerp), have a long-standing collaboration with the ESRF, the European Synchrotron, and in particular with the scientist Marine Cotte, to investigate these pigments and the best way to preserve the original masterpieces.\n\n\"At the ESRF, ID21 is one of the very few beamlines in the world where we can perform imaging X-ray absorption and fluorescence spectroscopy analysis of the entire sample, at low energy and with sub-micrometer spatial resolution,\" explains Janssens.\n\n\"EBS, the new Extremely Brilliant Source, the first-of-a-kind high-energy synchrotron, which is under commissioning at the moment at the ESRF, will further improve the capabilities of our instruments for the benefit of world heritage science. We will be able to perform microanalyses with increased sensitivity, and a greater level of detail. Considering the complexity of these artistic materials, such instrumental developments will highly benefit the analysis of our cultural heritage,\" adds Cotte, ESRF scientist and CNRS researcher director.\n\n\"This kind of work shows that art and science are intrinsically linked and that science can help preserve pieces of art so that the world can continue admiring them for years to come,\" concludes Miliani, coordinator of MOLAB.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515135407.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:54:07", "title": "COVID-19 infection control, radiographer protection in CT exam areas", "text": "In an open-access article published ahead-of-print by the American Journal of Roentgenology (AJR), a team of Chinese radiologists discussed modifications to the CT examination process and strict disinfection of examination rooms, while outlining personal protection measures for radiographers during the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) outbreak.\n\nAs Jieming Qu, Wenjie Yang, and colleagues at Shanghai Jiao Tong University Medical School Affiliated Ruijin Hospital noted, to undergo CT, patients must exit the fever clinic and proceed to an examination room elsewhere at the institution.

A safe infection control strategy for examination of patients with suspected SARS-CoV-2 was also implemented, including reconstructing the area and planning the path a patient would take.

For many years, the lack of shellfish in some layers at these sites puzzled archaeologists. In spite of apparently living near the ocean, the inhabitants hunted mostly big game -- the sort of animals that typically live farther inland.\n\nScientists knew a submerged landscape existed on the continental shelf just offshore, but it wasn't until recently, perhaps inspired by rising sea levels of our current human-caused global warming, they realized these caves might have made up the westernmost edge of a long-lost plain.\n\nadvertisement\n\nDuring most of the Pleistocene, the geological era before the one we live in now, these caves were not located on the coast. With so much of the Earth's water locked up in continent-sized glaciers, sea level was much lower, and humans could have thrived between the cliffs and a gentler coastline miles and miles to the east.\n\nA special issue of Quaternary Science Reviews presents papers using a wide range of techniques to reconstruct the environment and ecology of the Paleo-Agulhas Plain. They reveal a verdant world rich with game, plant, and coastal resources, periodically cut off from the mainland during warm spells between glacial periods when sea level rose to levels similar to those of today, which would have played an important role in human evolution.\n\nFranklin and her colleagues used modern vegetation patterns along the Cape south coast to develop models of the expected vegetation for the various soil types, as well as the climate (especially rainfall) and fire regimes of the past glacial periods that framed most of the timeframe in which modern humans emerged.\n\nJoining her in the research were Richard M. Cowling and Alastair J. Potts of Nelson Mandela University; Guy F. Midgley at Stellenbosch University; Francois Engelbrecht of the University of Witwatersrand; and Curtis W. Marean of Arizona State University.\n\nVegetation was reconstructed based on a model of the ancient climate and fire patterns of these glacial phases that define human evolution. The group developed the vegetation model based on present-day patterns and environmental conditions, compared their model to an independently derived vegetation map to validate it, then applied it to the climate, landforms, and soils reconstructed for the peak of the last ice age on the Palaeo-Agulhas Plain.\n\nReconstruction, mapping, and modeling of the paleo-climate, geology, and soils by their collaborators are featured in other articles in the special issue.\n\nThe model found the paleo-landscape exposed during glacial low-sea levels added a land area the size of Ireland to the southern tip of Africa. Near the coast, it was dominated by \"limestone fynbos,\" a low-stature, but species-rich shrubland typical of contemporary South Africa's Cape Floristic Province, a global plant diversity hotspot. The northern plains were mostly grasslands in shallow floodplains and on shale bedrock.\n\nThis savanna-like vegetation is rare in the modern landscape and would have supported the megafauna typical of glacial periods. These game animals, found in the archaeological record, include a great diversity of grazing animals, including the now-extinct giant Cape Buffalo, and others of which no longer occur naturally in this part of Africa, such as giraffes.\n\nThe Paleo-Agulhas plain had extremely high plant species diversity, as well as a greater variety of ecosystems and plant communities than currently found in this region, including shale grassland with dune fynbos-thicket mosaic on uplands and broad and shallow floodplains supporting a mosaic of woodland and grassland on fertile, alluvial soils.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131915.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:15", "title": "The dreaming brain tunes out the outside world", "text": "Scientists from the CNRS and the ENS-PSL in France and Monash University in Australia have shown that the brain suppresses information from the outside world, such as the sound of a conversation, during the sleep phase linked to dreaming. This ability could be one of the protective mechanisms of dreams. The study, carried out in collaboration with the Centre du Sommeil et de la Vigilance, H\u00f4tel-Dieu, AP-HP -- Universit\u00e9 de Paris, is published in Current Biology on 14 May 2020.\n\nWhile we dream, we invent worlds that bear no relation to the quietness of our bedroom. In fact, it is rather unusual for elements of our immediate environment to be incorporated into our dreams. To better understand how the brain protects itself from outside influences, researchers invited 18 participants to a morning nap in the lab. Morning sleep is rich in dreams. Dreams mostly occur during what is known as REM sleep, since the brain is somehow in a waking state during this phase of sleep, showing brain activity similar to that when a person is awake. The body, on the other hand, is paralysed, although not entirely. During certain phases of REM sleep, the eyes continue to move. Research has shown that such movements are related to dreaming.\n\nTo study how the dreaming brain interacts with external sounds, the scientists got volunteer sleepers to listen to stories in French mixed with meaningless language. By combining the electroencephalogram with a machine learning technique, they confirmed that, even when the brain is asleep, it continues to record everything that goes on around it. They also showed that, during light sleep, the brain prioritises meaningful speech, just as it does when in the waking state. However, such speech is actively filtered out during eye movement phases in REM sleep. In other words, our sleeping brain can select information from the outside world and flexibly amplify or suppress it, depending on whether or not it is immersed in a dream!\n\nThe team believe that this mechanism enables the brain to protect the dreaming phase, which is necessary for emotional balance and consolidation of the day's learning. Although dreams are predominant during periods of eye movement, they can also occur during other phases of sleep. Are they then accompanied by a similar suppression of sensations from the outside world?", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131911.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:11", "title": "Scientists break the link between a quantum material's spin and orbital states", "text": "In designing electronic devices, scientists look for ways to manipulate and control three basic properties of electrons: their charge; their spin states, which give rise to magnetism; and the shapes of the fuzzy clouds they form around the nuclei of atoms, which are known as orbitals.\n\nUntil now, electron spins and orbitals were thought to go hand in hand in a class of materials that's the cornerstone of modern information technology; you couldn't quickly change one without changing the other. But a study at the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory shows that a pulse of laser light can dramatically change the spin state of one important class of materials while leaving its orbital state intact.\n\nThe results suggest a new path for making a future generation of logic and memory devices based on \"orbitronics,\" said Lingjia Shen, a SLAC research associate and one of the lead researchers for the study.\n\n\"What we're seeing in this system is the complete opposite of what people have seen in the past,\" Shen said. \"It raises the possibility that we could control a material's spin and orbital states separately, and use variations in the shapes of orbitals as the 0s and 1s needed to make computations and store information in computer memories.\"\n\nThe international research team, led by Joshua Turner, a SLAC staff scientist and investigator with the Stanford Institute for Materials and Energy Science (SIMES), reported their results this week in Physical Review B Rapid Communications.\n\nAn intriguing, complex material\n\nThe material the team studied was a manganese oxide-based quantum material known as NSMO, which comes in extremely thin crystalline layers. It's been around for three decades and is used in devices where information is stored by using a magnetic field to switch from one electron spin state to another, a method known as spintronics. NSMO is also considered a promising candidate for making future computers and memory storage devices based on skyrmions, tiny particle-like vortexes created by the magnetic fields of spinning electrons.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut this material is also very complex, said Yoshinori Tokura, director of the RIKEN Center for Emergent Matter Science in Japan, who was also involved in the study.\n\n\"Unlike semiconductors and other familiar materials, NSMO is a quantum material whose electrons behave in a cooperative, or correlated, manner, rather than independently as they usually do,\" he said. \"This makes it hard to control one aspect of the electrons' behavior without affecting all the others.\"\n\nOne common way to investigate this type of material is to hit it with laser light to see how its electronic states respond to an injection of energy. That's what the research team did here. They observed the material's response with X-ray laser pulses from SLAC's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS).\n\nOne melts, the other doesn't\n\nWhat they expected to see was that orderly patterns of electron spins and orbitals in the material would be thrown into total disarray, or \"melted,\" as they absorbed pulses of near-infrared laser light.\n\nadvertisement\n\nBut to their surprise, only the spin patterns melted, while the orbital patterns stayed intact, Turner said. The normal coupling between the spin and orbital states had been completely broken, he said, which is a challenging thing to do in this type of correlated material and had not been observed before.\n\nTokura said, \"Usually only a tiny application of photoexcitation destroys everything. Here, they were able to keep the electron state that is most important for future devices -- the orbital state -- undamaged. This is a nice new addition to the science of orbitronics and correlated electrons.\"\n\nMuch as electron spin states are switched in spintronics, electron orbital states could be switched to provide a similar function. These orbitronic devices could, in theory, operate 10,000 faster than spintronic devices, Shen said.\n\nSwitching between two orbital states could be made possible by using short bursts of terahertz radiation, rather than the magnetic fields used today, he said: \"Combining the two could achieve much better device performance for future applications.\" The team is working on ways to do that.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131909.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:09", "title": "Blood clotting abnormalities reveal COVID-19 patients at risk for thrombotic events", "text": "When researchers from the University of Colorado Anschutz Medical Campus, Aurora, used a combination of two specific blood-clotting tests, they found critically ill patients infected with Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) who were at high risk for developing renal failure, venous blood clots, and other complications associated with blood clots, such as stroke. Their study, which was one of the first to build on growing evidence that COVID-19-infected patients are highly predisposed to developing blood clots, linked blood clotting measurements with actual patient outcomes. The research team is now participating in a randomized clinical trial of a drug that breaks down blood clots in COVID-19-infected patients.\n\n\"This is an early step on the road to discovering treatments to prevent some of the complications that come with this disease,\" said Franklin Wright, MD, FACS, lead author of the research article and an assistant professor of surgery at the University of Colorado School of Medicine.\n\nTheir research is published as an \"article in press\" on the Journal of the American College of Surgeons website ahead of print.\n\nPatients who are critically ill regardless of cause can develop a condition known as disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). The blood of these patients initially forms many clots in small blood vessels. The body's natural clotting factors can form too much clot or eventually not be able to effectively form any clot leading to issues of both excessive clotting and excessive bleeding. However, in patients with COVID-19 the clotting appears to be particularly severe and -- as evidenced by case studies in China and elsewhere -- clots in COVID-19 patients do not appear to dissipate, explained Dr. Wright.\n\nTrauma acute care surgeons and intensive care physicians who treat trauma, transplant, and cardiothoracic surgery patients at UC Health University of Colorado Hospital saw the potential of using a specialized coagulation test to examine clotting issues in COVID-19 patients. Thromboelastography (TEG) is a whole blood assay that provides a broad picture of how an individual patient's blood forms clots, including how long clotting takes, how strong clots are, and how soon clots break down. TEG is highly specialized and used primarily by surgeons and anesthesiologists to evaluate the efficiency of blood clotting; it is not widely used in other clinical settings. \"The COVID pandemic is opening doors for multidisciplinary collaboration so trauma acute care surgeons and intensivists can bring the tools they use in their day-to-day lives and apply them in the critical care setting to new problems,\" Dr. Wright said.\n\nThe researchers evaluated outcomes for all patients who had a TEG assay as part of their treatment for COVID-19 infection as well as other conventional coagulation assays, including ones that measure D-dimer levels. D-dimer is a protein fragment that is produced when a blood clot dissolves. D-dimer levels are elevated when large numbers of clots are breaking down.\n\nA total of 44 patients treated for COVID-19 infection between March 22 and April 20 were included in the analysis. Those whose bodies were not breaking down clots most often required hemodialysis and had a higher rate of clots in the veins. These patients were identified by TEG assays showing no clot breakdown after 30 minutes and a D-dimer level greater than 2600 ng/mL. Eighty percent of patients with both affirmative test findings were placed on dialysis compared with 14 percent who tested for neither finding. Patients with affirmative test findings also had a 50 percent rate of venous blood clots compared with 0 percent for those patients with neither finding.\n\n\"These study results suggest there may be a benefit to early TEG testing in institutions that have the technology to identify COVID-19 patients who may need more aggressive anticoagulation therapy to prevent complications from clot formation,\" Dr. Wright said.\n\nA clinical trial of one form of treatment is already underway. The Denver Health and Hospital Authority is leading a multi-center study that includes UC Health University of Colorado Hospital, National Jewish Health-St Joseph Hospital, Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center, and Long Island Jewish Hospital in conjunction with Genentech, Inc., enrolling patients with COVID-19 infection in a randomized clinical trial of tissue plasminogen activator (tPA). This drug is a natural anticoagulant that was approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration in 1996 for the treatment of diseases associated with clotting disorders, such as heart attack, stroke, and pulmonary embolism. The trial will assess the efficacy and safety of intravenous tPA in improving respiratory function and management of patients with aggressive blood clotting.\n\n\"This study suggests that testing whole blood clotting measurements may allow physicians to identify and treat patients with COVID-19 more effectively to prevent complications and encourage further research into therapies to prevent blood clots in these patients,\" Dr. Wright said.\n\nDr. Wright's associates in this study include: Thomas O.

The effect of shrubs is so powerful that it even counterbalances the lower annual rainfall amounts expected during climate change.\n\nUntil now, researchers have thought that woody plants like trees and shrubs have deeper roots than grass. This belief stemmed from scientists performing their related studies on flat ground.\n\n\"It is striking that ecosystem composition is what controls projected future changes to groundwater recharge,\" Schreiner-McGraw said. \"This does not mean that climate change is not important, but that vegetation change is potentially more important and something that scientists and land managers should focus more effort on understanding.\"\n\nCo-author Hoori Ajami, an assistant professor of groundwater hydrology at UC Riverside, said the paper looks at the combined effects of climate and vegetation change on groundwater-recharge processes in arid environments.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Most studies to date have looked at these changes in isolation,\" Ajami said. \"Here we illustrate that the combined effects of vegetation change and climate change could be greater or less than the sum of its parts.\"\n\nThe intrusion of shrubs into grasslands is often considered a problem because it reduces the amount of forage available for livestock grazing and can lead to more bare ground patches and subsequent increase in soil erosion. This process of creating more bare ground is called \"xerification.\" Climate change contributes to xerification, but fire suppression and overgrazing play the biggest roles.\n\nIt makes sense that shrubs, which have deep root systems along with thick stems and many leaves, capture more water than grass does as it percolates down through the soil, leaving less available water to replenish the underground aquifers. Research on \"diffuse recharge,\" the process by which water replenishes groundwater supplies over a large area, seems to bear this out for flat landscapes. Xerification of grasslands has thus been viewed as bad for both livestock and the water cycle.\n\n\"We approached this research with a simple premise that topography plays a role in redistributing available water, and this should affect the outcomes of xerification,\" said co-author Enrique R. Vivoni, a professor at Arizona State University.\n\nThe group looked at focused recharge, which occurs when hillslopes funnel water into concentrated areas, such as streambeds. Streambeds often have sandy bottoms, which allow water to quickly infiltrate and prevent the deep-rooted shrubs from sucking it up.\n\nadvertisement\n\nData from a highly monitored desert mountain slope in New Mexico was used to simulate the effects of woody plant encroachment and climate change on water resources. The team discovered that not only did the shrubs increase focused groundwater recharge, but that they did so even under conditions where climate change reduced the amount of rainfall.\n\nThey also modeled a more extensive form of shrub encroachment called thicketization, in which plants grow in dense stands with no bare patches, and found, as in prior flat landscape research, the shrubs reduced the amount of groundwater recharge on slopes as well.\n\nOn hillslopes, bare soil in between patches of shrubs is necessary to drive water into streambeds. Increased runoff increases focused groundwater recharge.\n\n\"We were surprised to find that a transition from grassland to shrubland can increase sustainability of groundwater aquifers,\" said Schreiner-McGraw. \"The best way to increase focused recharge in this system is to increase the amount of runoff from hillslopes that gets concentrated in the streambeds.\"\n\nClimate change will most likely increase groundwater recharge by making rainstorms larger, but less frequent. Larger storms increase the amount of runoff that reaches sandy-bottom channels and increases groundwater recharge. Findings from this study suggest vegetation will also play an important part in groundwater recharge in the future.\n\nThough the study took place in New Mexico, Schreiner-McGraw said it applies to similar environments. Large parts of California are also desert savannahs. Southern California and the Central Valley have landforms similar to those found in the New Mexico study site. These areas could experience similar hydrological processes, though atmospheric rivers create storms very different from monsoon storms, so more research is required.\n\n\"The study highlights the role of long-term monitoring in understanding water balance dynamics of watersheds, and the role that process-based modeling plays in understanding system dynamics,\" Ajami said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515131905.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T18:19:05", "title": "Observation of intervalley transitions can boost valleytronic science and technology", "text": "An international research team led by scientists at the University of California, Riverside, has observed light emission from a new type of transition between electronic valleys, known as intervalley transmissions.\n\nThe research provides a new way to read out valley information, potentially leading to new types of devices.\n\nCurrent semiconductor technology uses electronic charge or spin to store and process information; the associated technologies are called electronics and spintronics, respectively. Some semiconductors contain local energy valleys in their electron band structure that can be used to encode, process, and store information, giving rise to a new kind of technology called valleytronics.\n\n\"Valleytronics provides an alternative route to engineer information systems besides the conventional electronics and spintronics,\" said Chun Hung \"Joshua\" Lui, an assistant professor in the Department of Physics and Astronomy at UC Riverside, who led the research on intervalley transitions in monolayer tungsten diselenide (WSe 2 ). \"Our new work can speed up the development of valleytronics.\"\n\nMonolayer WSe 2 is a promising valleytronic material because it possesses two valleys with opposite dynamic characteristics in the band structure. Moreover, this material can interact strongly with light, holding promise for optically controllable valleytronic applications.\n\nExcitons\n\nWhen monolayer WSe 2 absorbs a photon, a bound electron can be freed in a valley, leaving behind an electron vacancy, or hole. As the hole behaves like an electron with positive charge, the electron and hole can attract each other to form a bound state called an exciton. Such an exciton, with both its electron and hole in the same valley, is called an intravalley exciton. Current exciton research in monolayer valley semiconductors focuses predominantly on intravalley excitons, which can emit light.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAn electron and a hole in opposite valleys can also form an exciton, called an intervalley exciton, which is a novel component in valleytronics. The law of momentum conservation, however, forbids an electron and a hole in opposite valleys from recombining directly to emit light. As a result, intervalley excitons are \"dark\" and hidden in the optical spectrum.\n\nThe UCR-led research team has now observed light emission from intervalley excitons in monolayer WSe 2 . The team found that although the intervalley excitons are intrinsically dark, they can emit a significant amount of light with the assistance of either defects or lattice vibrations in the material.\n\n\"The scattering with defects or lattice vibrations can compensate for the momentum mismatch between an electron and a hole in opposite valleys,\" Lui said. \"It allows us to observe the light emission of intervalley excitons.\"\n\n\"Although the process involves scattering with defects or lattice vibrations, the intervalley light emission is circularly polarized,\" said Erfu Liu, a postdoctoral researcher in Lui's lab and the first author of the research paper. \"Such circular light polarization allows us to identify the exciton valley configuration. This optically readable valley configuration is crucial to making intervalley excitons useful for valleytronic applications.\"\n\nTrions\n\nBesides the excitons, monolayer WSe 2 also hosts trions, which consist of two electrons and one hole or two holes and one electron. Trions also have well-defined valley configurations for valleytronic applications. Compared to the charge-neutral excitons, the motion of trions can be controlled by an electric field due to their net electrical charge.\n\nadvertisement\n\nA trion can generally decay through two paths. For example, for a trion consisting of an intravalley electron-hole pair and a hole in the opposite valley to decay, the electron can choose to recombine with the hole in the same valley or with the hole in the opposite valley. This gives rise to two different trion decay paths with intravalley and intervalley electron-hole recombination. The intravalley trion decay has been much studied, but the intervalley trion decay has not been reported thus far.\n\nThe UCR-led team has shown intervalley trion decay for the first time.\n\n\"Although a trion can decay through either intravalley or intervalley decay, the two transitions have the same energy and can hardly be distinguished in the optical spectrum,\" Lui said. \"But when a magnetic field is applied, the energies of the intravalley and intervalley transitions will become different.\"\n\nThe team carried out the experiments at the National High Magnetic Field Laboratory in Tallahassee, Florida. They show both the intravalley and intervalley decay paths of the trions.\n\n\"Our results provide a more complete, multipath picture of trion dynamics in monolayer WSe 2 ,\" said Jeremiah van Baren, a graduate student in Lui's lab, who shares equal authorship with Liu. \"They build on the existing single-path description of trions in 2-D materials and are key to furthering trion-based valleytronic science and technology.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515115654.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T16:56:54", "title": "Eavesdropping on single molecules with light by replaying the chatter", "text": "Scientists have pioneered a new technique to expose hidden biochemical pathways involving single molecules at the nanoscale.\n\nA team of researchers from the University of Exeter's Living Systems Institute used light to establish a means to monitor the structure and properties of individual molecules in real time.\n\nThis innovative approach has allowed the team to temporarily bridge molecules together to provide a crucial lens into their dynamics.\n\nThe study is published in the leading journal Nature Communications.\n\nThe structure of individual molecules and their properties, such as chirality, are difficult to probe.\n\nIn the new study, led by Professor Frank Vollmer, the group was able to observe reactions at the nanoscale which would otherwise be inaccessible.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThiol/disulfide exchange -- or the principal way disulfide bonds are formed and rearranged in a protein -- has not yet been fully scrutinised at equilibrium at the single-molecule level, in part because this cannot be optically resolved in bulk samples.\n\nHowever, light can circulate around micron-sized glass spheres to form resonances. The trapped light can then repeatedly interact with its surrounding environment. By attaching gold nanoparticles to the sphere, light is enhanced and spatially confined down to the size of viruses and amino acids.\n\nThe resulting optoplasmonic coupling allows for the detection of biomolecules that approach the nanoparticles while they attach to the gold, detach, and interact in a variety of ways.\n\nDespite the sensitivity of this technique, there is lacking specificity.

According to the model, disruptions in the cattle industry -- especially in the beef packing plants -- will affect the transportation industry and together cause great economic harm. The disruptions modeled in the simulation share similarities with how the packing plants have been affected during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\n\"When we first started working on this project, there was a lot of emphasis on studying critical infrastructures; especially ones that are interdependent, meaning that they need to work together with other critical infrastructures,\" Scoglio said. \"The idea is if there is a failure in one of the systems, it can propagate to the other system, increasing the catastrophic effects.\"\n\nThe study included a variety of viewpoints to create a realistic and integrated model of both systems.

It was first cultivated 9,000 years ago in the Yangtze Valley in China and later spread across East, Southeast, and South Asia, followed by the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and the Americas. In the process, rice evolved and adapted to different environments, but little is known about the routes, timing, and environmental forces involved in this spread.\n\nIn their study, the researchers reconstructed the historical movement of rice across Asia using whole-genome sequences of more than 1,400 varieties of rice -- including varieties of japonica and indica, two main subspecies of Asian rice -- coupled with geography, archaeology, and historical climate data.\n\nFor the first 4,000 years of its history, farming rice was largely confined to China, and japonica was the subspecies grown. Then, a global cooling event 4,200 years ago -- also known as the 4.2k event, which is thought to have had widespread consequences, including the collapse of civilizations from Mesopotamia to China -- coincided with japonica rice diversifying into temperate and tropical varieties. The newly evolved temperate varieties spread in northern China, Korea and Japan, while the tropical varieties and spread to Southeast Asia.\n\n\"This abrupt climate change forced plants, including crops, to adapt,\" said Rafal M. Gutaker, a postdoctoral associate at the NYU Center for Genomics and Systems Biology and the study's lead author. \"Our genomic data, as well as paleoclimate modeling by our collaborators, show that the cooling event occurred at the same time as the rise of temperate japonica, which grows in milder regions. This cooling event also may have led to the migration of rice agriculture and farmer communities into Southeast Asia.\"\n\n\"These findings were then backed up by data from archaeological rice remains excavated in Asia, which also showed that after the 4.2k event, tropical rice migrated south while rice also adapted to northern latitudes as temperate varieties,\" said Michael D. Purugganan, the Silver Professor of Biology at NYU, who led the study.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAfter the global cooling event, tropical japonica rice continued to diversify. It reached islands in Southeast Asia about 2,500 years ago, likely due to extensive trade networks and the movement of goods and peoples in the region -- a finding also supported by archeological data.\n\nThe spread of indica rice was more recent and more complicated; after originating in India's lower Ganges Valley roughly 4,000 years ago, the researchers traced its migration from India into China approximately 2,000 years ago.\n\nWhile the researchers had thought that rainfall and water would be the most limiting environmental factor in rice diversity, they found temperature to be the key factor instead. Their analyses revealed that heat accumulation and temperature were very strongly associated with the genomic differences between tropical and temperate japonica rice varieties.\n\n\"This study illustrates the value of multidisciplinary research. Our genomic data gave us a model for where and when rice spread to different parts of Asia, archaeology told us when and where rice showed up at various places, and the environmental and climate modeling gave us the ecological context,\" said Purugganan. \"Together, this approach allows us to write a first draft of the story of how rice dispersed across Asia.\"\n\nUnderstanding the spread of rice and the related environmental pressures could also help scientists develop new varieties that meet future environmental challenges, such as climate change and drought -- which could help address looming food security issues.\n\n\"Armed with knowledge of the pattern of rice dispersal and environmental factors that influenced its migration, we can examine the evolutionary adaptations of rice as it spread to new environments, which could allow us to identify traits and genes to help future breeding efforts,\" said Gutaker.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515115644.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T16:56:44", "title": "Heart attacks, heart failure, stroke: COVID-19's dangerous cardiovascular complications: ER doctors highlight underappreciated risks, potential drug interactions", "text": "COVID-19 can cause serious cardiovascular complications including heart failure, heart attacks and blood clots that can lead to strokes, emergency medicine doctors report in a new scientific paper.

One study, the article authors note, found that almost a quarter of COVID-19 patients -- 24% -- were suffering acute heart failure when they were first diagnosed with the coronavirus. (This doesn't mean that 24% of all COVID-19 patients will suffer heart failure. The authors state that it remains unclear if the heart failure was the result of COVID-19 specifically or if the virus was worsening undiagnosed heart failure.)\n\nOf the patients with heart failure, nearly half were not known to have high blood pressure or cardiovascular disease.\n\nStrokes and Other Concerns\n\nThe paper also notes that COVID-19, and other diseases that cause severe inflammation throughout the body, increase the risk that fatty plaque built up in the blood vessels will rupture, leading to heart attacks and stroke. Influenza and certain other viruses have been associated with increased risk of plaque ruptures within the first week after the disease was diagnosed, the authors state in their review of the available COVID-19 medical literature.\n\nFinally, the authors describe potential drug interactions in COVID-19 patients. For example, the highly publicized malaria drug hydroxychloroquine can interact with medications designed to regulate heart rhythm, in addition to causing heart damage and worsening cardiomyopathy. Remdesivir, an antiviral that is the only COVID-19 treatment authorized by the FDA, can cause low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm. It's important for doctors to bear these interactions in mind when treating patients with COVID-19, the authors note.\n\n\"As we gain more experience with this new pathogen, we realize that its adverse impact extends beyond the respiratory system,\" Brady said. \"We will continue to learn more about COVID-19 and the most optimal means of managing its many presentations.\"\n\nFindings Published\n\nThe article has been published online by the American Journal of Emergency Medicine.

And being passionate about solving as much of 'their' social issue as they possibly can, social entrepreneurs are motivated to grow.\n\n\"They can also benefit from lower costs due to tax breaks and partial reliance on volunteers to have a growth advantage over commercial firms offering competing products or services.\"\n\nThe authors of the study acknowledge that as the commercial firm sector is much larger than the social sector, total job creation is greater overall.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe study compared regions in Sweden in terms of their social and commercial start-ups between 1990 to 2014 and their net job creation effects in each up to eight years after they entered the market.\n\n\"Similar comparisons for Australia or other countries do not yet exist,\" said Professor Obschonka.\n\n\"However, total employment in the social sector has grown recently in other countries, so our findings would most likely be valid in Australia and elsewhere along with Sweden.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515103920.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T15:39:20", "title": "Metagenomics reveals distinct microbiotypes of giant clams", "text": "New research conducted at CRIOBE and ENTROPIE research units, with the collaboration of the Swire institute of Marine Science of The University of Hong Kong, The Cawthron Institute and James Cook University, highlights the impacts of benthic species assemblages on the giant clams Tridacna maxima. The findings were recently published in the journal Microbiome.\n\nThe researchers explored for the first time the influence of benthic species-assemblages on giant clams health, with or without increasing temperature. To do so, they created artificial benthic assemblages using two coral species (Pocillopora damicornis and Acropora cytherea) and one giant clam species (Tridacna maxima). The results showed that the health status of giant clams depended on the neighbouring species. Moreover, using cutting-edge DNA multiplexing-metabarcoding technology adapted by Dr. Xavier Pochon, the team studied the microbial community of the giant clams. The researchers newly discovered distinct microbiotypes (group of specific bacteria) in the studied T. maxima population, one of which was linked to clam mortality.\n\nGiant clams are less studied by scientists, yet they are important members of coral reefs and play numerous ecological roles. They are the largest living bivalves and serve as food for fish and human. Like coral, they contribute to primary production through photosynthesis by hosting unicellular algae. They also host a large community of bacteria as well as animals such as shrimps or crabs. However, all of the 12 currently recognised species are under threat and more than 50% of the wild population are either locally extinct or severely depleted.\n\n\"For decades we have been focusing on the effect of climate change on single species but this doesn't reflect what could happen within coral reef as a whole. This is why we decided to explore the effect of neighbouring species on the giant clam. We were extremely surprised to discover that the presence of some corals, particularly Acropora cytherea, led to an acute sensitivity of giant clams to increasing temperature which therefore exhibited a high death rate.\" explains Dr. Isis Guibert.\n\nMicrobiomes are an integral part of multicellular organisms, contributing to their health and physiological performance. The scientists noted that despite a surge of interest in this research focus, very few invertebrate microbiomes have been studied. The microbiome of giant clams is particularly interesting because clams are exposed to an extreme abundance and diversity of microbes through filter feeding. The discovery of specific microbiome structure, detectable from the genus level, is the first description of microbiotypes in invertebrates. \"The results of our study suggest that, similarly to humans, genetic factors might drive the microbiotype of a giant clam.\" said Dr. Isis Guibert.\n\nInterestingly, the clams with compromised health were characterised by a prominence of vibrio and therefore a distinct microbiome. \"The relative proportion of Vibrionaceae could be used as an early indicator of clam health in natural populations.\" explains Dr.V\u00e9ronique Berteaux-Lecellier, who supervised the study, \"We hypothesise that A. cytherea could secrete metabolites that might have weakened the clams' defenses against Vibrio infection; future research should explore this possibility.\" The findings of this study suggest that the composition of the coral reef benthos, together with increasing water temperatures, could negatively impact the health of giant clams and potentially other reef organisms. Therefore, the findings support the idea that, like terrestrial conservation and restoration, taking account of the entire benthic assemblages should be the goal of marine conservation strategies.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515103918.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T15:39:18", "title": "Quantifying the impact of interventions in COVID-19 pandemic", "text": "Since the beginning of March, public life in Germany has been severely restricted due to the coronavirus pandemic. Following the encouraging decline in the number of new cases of COVID-19, the debate on the effectiveness of interventions taken to date and on further relaxation of the restrictions is meanwhile gaining momentum.\n\nResearchers from the Max Planck Institute for Dynamics and Self-Organization (MPIDS) and the University of G\u00f6ttingen have now succeeded in analyzing the German COVID-19 case numbers with respect to past containment measures and deriving scenarios for the coming weeks. Their computer models could also provide insights into the effectiveness of interventions in other countries. Their results have been published today online in the journal Science.\n\nSimulations since mid-March\n\nMany people are currently concerned about how well the measures to contain the pandemic have worked in recent weeks and how things will continue in the coming weeks. Scientists at the MPIDS have been investigating these questions. The team has been simulating the course of the coronavirus epidemic in Germany together with scientists from the G\u00f6ttingen Campus since mid-March. In their model calculations, the researchers relate the gradually increasing restrictions of public life in March to the development of COVID-19 case numbers. In particular, they examined the effect of the three packages of interventions in March: the cancellation of major public events around March 8, the closure of educational institutions and many shops on March 16, and the extensive contact ban on March 22. To this end, the researchers combined data on the temporal course of the COVID-19 new infections with an epidemiological dynamics model that allows the analysis of the course of the pandemic to date and the investigation of scenarios for the future. According to the computer models, the packages of measures initially slowed down the spread of COVID-19 and finally broke the dreaded exponential growth.\n\n\"Our analysis clearly shows the effect of the various interventions, which together ultimately brought about a strong trend reversal,\" says Viola Priesemann, research group leader at the Max Planck Institute. Michael Wilczek, research group leader and co-author of the study, adds: \"Our model calculations thus show us the overall effect of the change in people's behavior that goes hand in hand with the interventions.\"\n\nA computer model also for other countries and regions\n\nIn their work, the G\u00f6ttingen researchers did not only have Germany in mind. \"From the very beginning, we designed our computer model so that it could be transferred to other countries and regions. Our analysis tools are freely available on GitHub (https://github.com/Priesemann-Group/covid19_inference_forecast) and are already being used and developed further by researchers around the world,\" says Jonas Dehning, lead author of the study. The G\u00f6ttingen research team is currently working on applying the model to European countries. It is particularly important to work out the different points in time at which the measures were taken in different countries, which could allow to draw conclusions about the effectiveness of the individual measures.\n\nConcerns about the second wave\n\nThe G\u00f6ttingen researchers' analysis of Germany on the basis of case numbers up to April 21 indicated an overall positive development of case numbers for the coming weeks. However, their analysis also reveals a central challenge in assessing the epidemic dynamics: changes in the spread of the coronavirus are only reflected in the COVID-19 case numbers with considerable delays. \"We have only recently seen the first effects of the relaxation of restrictions of April 20 in the case numbers. And until we can evaluate the relaxations of May 11, we also have to wait two to three weeks,\" says Michael Wilczek. The researchers are therefore continuing to monitor the situation very closely. Every day they evaluate the new case numbers to assess whether a second wave is to be expected.\n\nUsing three different model scenarios, the G\u00f6ttingen team also shows how the number of new cases might develop further. If the relaxations of May 11 doubles the infection rate, a second wave can be expected. Instead, if the infection rate balances the recovery rate, the new infections stay approximately constant. However, it is also possible that the number of new infections will continue to decrease, says Viola Priesemann: \"If everyone continues to be very careful and contact tracing by the health authorities is effective, and at the same time all new outbreaks of infection are detected and contained early, then the number of cases can continue to decrease. How exactly the numbers will develop in the future, therefore, depends decisively on our behavior, the observance of distance recommendations and hygiene measures,\" says the G\u00f6ttingen physicist.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515103916.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T15:39:16", "title": "Binge drinkers beware, Drunkorexia is calling: Around 1 in 3 female students report saving calories for binge drinking episodes", "text": "Mojito, appletini or a simple glass of fizz -- they may take the edge off a busy day, but if you find yourself bingeing on more than a few, you could be putting your physical and mental health at risk according new research at the University of South Australia.\n\nExamining the drinking patterns of 479 female Australian university students aged 18-24 years, the world-first empirical study explored the underlying belief patterns than can contribute to Drunkorexia -- a damaging and dangerous behaviour where disordered patterns of eating are used to offset negative effects of consuming excess alcohol, such as gaining weight.\n\nConcerningly, researchers found that a staggering 82.7 per cent of female university students surveyed had engaged in Drunkorexic behaviours over the past three months. And, more than 28 per cent were regularly and purposely skipping meals, consuming low-calorie or sugar-free alcoholic beverages, purging or exercising after drinking to help reduce ingested calories from alcohol, at least 25 per cent of the time.\n\nClinical psychologist and lead UniSA researcher Alycia Powell-Jones says the prevalence of Drunkorexic behaviours among Australian female university students is concerning.\n\n\"Due to their age and stage of development, young adults are more likely to engage in risk-taking behaviours, which can include drinking excess alcohol,\" Powell-Jones says.\n\n\"Excess alcohol consumption combined with restrictive and disordered eating patterns is extremely dangerous and can dramatically increase the risk of developing serious physical and psychological consequences, including hypoglycaemia, liver cirrhosis, nutritional deficits, brain and heart damage, memory lapses, blackouts, depression and cognitive deficits.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"Certainly, many of us have drunk too much alcohol at some point in time, and we know just by how we feel the next day, that this is not good for us, but when nearly a third of young female uni students are intentionally cutting back on food purely to offset alcohol calories; it's a serious health concern.\"\n\nThe harmful use of alcohol is a global issue, with excess consumption causing millions of deaths, including many thousands of young lives.\n\nIn Australia, one in six people consume alcohol at dangerous levels, placing them at lifetime risk of an alcohol-related disease or injury. The combination of excessive alcohol intake with restrictive eating behaviours to offset calories can result in a highly toxic cocktail for this population.\n\nThe study was undertaken in two stages. The first measured the prevalence of self-reported, compensative and restrictive activities in relation to their alcohol consumption.\n\nThe second stage identified participants' Early Maladaptive Schemes (EMS) -- or thought patterns -- finding that that the subset of schemas most predictive of Drunkorexia were 'insufficient self-control', 'emotional deprivation' and 'social isolation'.\n\nadvertisement\n\nPowell-Jones says identifying the early maladaptive schemas linked to Drunkorexia is key to understanding the harmful condition.\n\nThese are deeply held and pervasive themes regarding oneself and one's relationship with others, that can develop in childhood and then can influence all areas of life, often in dysfunctional ways. Early maladaptive schemas can also be influenced by cultural and social norms.\n\nDrunkorexic behaviour appears to be motivated by two key social norms for young adults -- consuming alcohol and thinness.\n\n\"This study has provided preliminary insight into better understanding why young female adults make these decisions to engage in Drunkorexic behaviours,\" Powell-Jones says.\n\n\"Not only may it be a coping strategy to manage social anxieties through becoming accepted and fitting in with peer group or cultural expectations, but it also shows a reliance on avoidant coping strategies.\n\n\"It is important that clinicians, educators, parents and friends are aware of the factors that motivate young women to engage in this harmful and dangerous behaviour, including cultural norms, beliefs that drive self-worth, a sense of belonging, and interpersonal connectedness.\n\n\"By being connected, researchers and clinicians can develop appropriate clinical interventions and support for vulnerable young people within the youth mental health sector.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515103912.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T15:39:12", "title": "Pine martens like to have neighbors -- but not too near", "text": "Pine martens need neighbours but like to keep their distance, according to new research.\n\nOver three years, the cat-like predators were caught in Scotland and moved to mid-Wales by Vincent Wildlife Trust.\n\nBy attaching miniaturised radio-transmitter collars to 39 of the released animals, a tracking team followed them for a year as they explored their new home in Welsh forests.\n\nThe research, published today in the journal Ecology and Evolution, was carried out by Dr Cat McNicol from the Environment and Sustainability Institute of the University of Exeter with staff from Vincent Wildlife Trust.\n\nDr McNicol's analyses have shown that the pine martens spent some time exploring their new habitats before settling into solitary territories, but that having pine marten neighbours helped them settle more quickly.\n\nIn the first release, when there were no other pine martens nearby, the new arrivals roamed long distances over two weeks before settling into their chosen territory -- often close to the point where they were released.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe following year, when more pine martens were released in the same area, the new cohort established territories within a week, but further away from the release point.\n\nDr McNicol said \"Although they defend solitary territories vigorously, pine martens depend on their neighbours when deciding where to set up home.

Unfortunately, this requires additional surgical sites, increases pain for the patient at that site, and there is also just a very limited amount of non-essential bone!\n\nSynthetic alternatives made of minerals that already appear in the body but with similar mechanical properties to bone are sometimes used for other types of bone grafts. But these biomaterial substitutes have low bone regenerative properties compared to the gold standard of autologous grafts.\n\nThe conventional recipe for an OCP/Col preparation still runs into problems with 'appositional bone growth,' or increase in width, due to compressional stress on the material from the bone itself, so OCP/Col has been supported by a Teflon ring structure in order to retain its shape while the bone is forming. But Teflon is not a material that can be absorbed by the body and ultimately needs to be removed.\n\nTo get around this, professor Kamakura and his colleagues developed a recipe for OCP/Col that increases its density, and supercooled it with liquid nitrogen down to ?196\u00b0C before application on their rodent test subjects, producing the bone shape retention dental surgeons are looking for.\n\nThe researchers now intend to test the recipe on larger animals and then engage in clinical trials in humans.\n\nIn the last fifteen years, a new alternative bone-substitute, octacalcium phosphate, which provides the basis of the mineral crystals that make up bone, has appeared combined with collagen (OCP/Col) as a likely candidate because it has bone regenerative properties superior to earlier substitutes.

Yet, both efforts are surrounded by unresolved uncertainty whether the immune system can mount a substantial and lasting response to SARS-CoV-2 and whether exposure to circulating common cold coronaviruses provides any kind of protective immunity.\n\nA collaboration between the labs of Alessandro Sette, Dr. Biol. Sci. and Shane Crotty, Ph.D., at La Jolla Institute for Immunology is starting to fill in the massive knowledge gap with good news for vaccine developers and is providing the first cellular immunology data to help guide social distancing recommendations.\n\nPublished in today's online edition of Cell, the study documents a robust antiviral immune response to SARS-CoV-2 in a group of 20 adults who had recovered from COVID-19. The findings show that the body's immune system is able to recognize SARS-CoV-2 in many ways, dispelling fears that the virus may elude ongoing efforts to create an effective vaccine.\n\n\"If we had seen only marginal immune responses, we would have been concerned,\" says Sette, a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research, and adds, \"but what we see is a very robust T cell response against the spike protein, which is the target of most ongoing COVID-19 efforts, as well as other viral proteins. These findings are really good news for vaccine development.\"\n\n\"All efforts to predict the best vaccine candidates and fine-tune pandemic control measures hinge on understanding the immune response to the virus,\" says Crotty, also a professor in the Center for Infectious Disease and Vaccine Research. \"People were really worried that COVID-19 doesn't induce immunity, and reports about people getting re-infected reinforced these concerns, but knowing now that the average person makes a solid immune response should largely put those concerns to rest.\"\n\nIn an earlier study, Sette and his team had used bioinformatics tools to predict which fragments of SARS-CoV-2 are capable of activating human T cells. The scientists then, in this newest research, tested whether T cells isolated from adults who had recovered from COVID-19 without major problems, recognized the predicted protein fragments, or so-called peptides, from the virus itself. The scientists pooled the peptides into two big groups: The first so-called mega-pool included peptides covering all proteins in the viral genome apart from SARS-CoV-2's \"spike\" protein. The second mega-pool specifically focused on the spike protein that dots the surface of the virus, since almost all of the vaccines under development right now target this coronavirus spike protein.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We specifically chose to study people who had a normal disease course and didn't require hospitalization to provide a solid benchmark for what a normal immune response looks like, since the virus can do some very unusual things in some people,\" says Sette.\n\nThe researchers found that all COVID-19 patients had a solid CD4, or \"helper,\" T cell response, which helps antibody production. Almost all patients had produced virus-specific CD8, or \"killer,\" T cells, which eliminate virus-infected cells. \"Our data show that the virus induces what you would expect from a typical, successful antiviral response,\" says Crotty.\n\nAnd, although these results don't preclude that the immune response to SARS-CoV-2 may be detrimental, they provide an important baseline against which individuals' immune responses can be compared; or, as Sette likes to put it, \"if you can get a picture of something, you can discuss whether you like it or not but if there's no picture there's nothing to discuss.\"\n\n\"We have a solid starting foundation to now ask whether there's a difference in the type of immune response in people who have severe outcomes and require hospitalization versus people who can recover at home or are even asymptomatic,\" adds Sette. \"But not only that, we now have an important tool to determine whether the immune response in people who have received an experimental vaccine resembles what you would expect to see in a protective immune response to COVID-19, as opposed to an insufficient or detrimental response.\"\n\nThe teams also looked at the T cell response in blood samples that had been collected between 2015 and 2018, before SARS-CoV-2 started circulating. Many of these individuals had significant T cell reactivity against SARS-CoV-2, although they had never been exposed to SARS-CoV-2. But everybody has almost certainly seen at least three of the four common cold coronaviruses, which could explain the observed crossreactivity.\n\nIt is still unclear, though, whether the observed crossreactivity provides at least some level of preexisting immunity to SARS-CoV-2 and therefore could explain why some people or geographical locations are hit harder by COVID-19.\n\n\u00ac\u00ac\"Given the severity of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, any degree of cross-reactive coronavirus immunity could have a very substantial impact on the overall course of the pandemic and is a key detail to consider for epidemiologists as they try to scope out how severely COVID-19 will affect communities in the coming months,\" says Crotty.\n\nThe work was funded by the NIH NIAID (AI142742, AI135078, AI007036, AI00738475N9301900065, and U19 AI118626), the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, the Johnathan and Mary Tu Foundation and internal LJI institutional funds.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515085717.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T13:57:17", "title": "Tiny pop-up devices work relentlessly, even under extreme pressure", "text": "Miniature devices, notably those that bulge out from 2D surfaces like pop-up greeting cards, have seamlessly found their way into pressure-sensing and energy-harvesting technologies because of their ability to be frequently stretched, compressed or twisted. Despite their force-bearing abilities, it is still unclear if repeated physical stress can damage the working of these miniature devices, particularly if there is already a defect in their construction.\n\nUsing tiny pressure-sensing structures shaped like tables, Texas A&M University researchers have found that repeated pushes on the tables' flat surface do not cause the structures to fall apart, even when the compressive forces are extreme. Instead, these tiny devices, including those with slight defects, were resilient, continuing to remain functional by bending their legs in proportion to the applied force.\n\nThe researchers said their findings, published in the February issue of the journal Extreme Mechanics Letters, have direct implications on the longevity of technologies that incorporate miniature devices, like soft wearable electronics, stretchable solar cells and pressure-sensing socks.\n\nMiniature devices, like pressure sensors, need to faithfully convey the strength and a change in compressions. For many applications, sensors need to be very small to capture changes in pressure at a high enough resolution. Thus, miniature devices based on the Japanese paper-cutting and folding technique of kirigami offer an excellent solution.\n\nBorrowing the principles of kirigami, a design of the miniature device is first etched on a 2D surface. Then, an inward push from the design boundary makes the structure pop up. Other times, the 2D print is stretched or twisted to reveal a more intricate 3D design. Regardless of the final use, kirigami-based devices must face continuous distortions to their shape, a phenomenon engineers refer to as deformation.\n\n\"Part of the appeal of using kirigami structures is that they can be repeatedly deformed for extended periods of time,\" said Dr. Andreas A. Polycarpou, professor and department head in the J. Mike Walker '66 Department of Mechanical Engineering. \"But any kind of imperfection in these structures might impact their final performance, that is, their ability to be continuously deformed.\"\n\nTo investigate how defects might influence the function of kirigami devices, Polycarpou's team, led by Kian Bashandeh, graduate student in the College of Engineering and a primary author of the study, designed a set of experiments using tiny pressure sensors. Consisting of a flat surface supported by four legs, these structures buckle if pressure is applied from above.\n\nFor their study, the researchers repeatedly pressed down on the table-like structures using a diamond flat punch probe. Their sample included structures with slight defects, such as a small crack on one of the four legs or one slightly thinner leg.\n\nTo test the performance of these structures over time, they recorded how these structures behaved under repeated compressions using an electron microscope and measured the distance by which the legs bent.\n\nPolycarpou's team found that for both defect-free and defective kirigami structures, the compression caused the structures to \"stiffen\" or resist the downward force. Over time, however, even when compressive forces were extreme, the structures reached a steady-state and were able to recover from the repeated blows from the diamond punch.\n\nThe researchers said the results of their cyclic compression experiments suggest that systems with an assembly of kirigami devices can remain functional for a long period of time even if some of the devices within them have defects.\n\n\"For most applications, including pressure sensing, it's not one but multiple miniature devices working in tandem. Intuitively one would think that small defects in any one of the kirigami structures would be catastrophic for a system made with many of such structures,\" said Polycarpou. \"We now have evidence to show that they do not. So, if one is using smart socks to measure how pressure is distributed during gait, our results suggest that the miniature pressure sensors will still work remarkably well even if they are slightly defective.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515085710.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T13:57:10", "title": "Commercial airliners monitoring CO2 emissions from cities worldwide", "text": "Cities are responsible for more than 70% of the global total greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

A study by an international team, published in Scientific Reports, examined the data collected by commercial airliners and showed the potential of the aircraft data to contribute to the global GHG emission monitoring.\n\nThe CONTRAIL (Comprehensive Observation Network for TRace gases by AIrLiners) program is Japan's unique aircraft observation project. Since 2005, the CONTRAIL team has achieved high-precision atmospheric CO 2 measurements using instruments onboard Japan Airlines' (JAL) commercial airliners. \"Following the aircraft measurements conducted between Tokyo and Australia that I initiated in 1993, and had maintained during my entire career, the CONTRAIL program continuously expanded its global network and has provided numerous data to understand the carbon budget of this planet,\" stated Hidekazu Matsueda, co-author of the study and researcher at the Meteorological Research Institute, Japan.\n\nRecently, the team analyzed thousands of vertical ascending and descending measurements over airports and characterized CO 2 variations over 34 major cities worldwide for the first time. Airports are often located in the proximity of large cities to ensure convenient access. The CONTRAIL aircraft fly up and down over Narita International Airport many times nearly on a daily basis (7,692 times in total during 2005-2016) and are able to obtain atmospheric chemical signature of the Greater Tokyo Area (~several tens km away). With similar geographical locations of major airport relative to large urban centers, the research team examined the data collected around global airports in order to retrieve urban CO 2 emission signatures from the data. \"We analyzed millions of observational data collected at and around the Tokyo Narita Airport and found clear CO 2 enhancements when the wind comes from the Greater Tokyo Area,\" Taku Umezawa, leading author of the study and researcher at the National Insititute for Enviromental Studies, Japan, said. \"That was also the case globally for other airports, such as Moscow, Paris, Beijing, Osaka, Shanghai, Mexico City, Sydney, and others.\"\n\nThe team also examined the magnitude of CO 2 variability in the lowermost atmosphere over these airports. \"Short-term changes in the CO 2 concentration in the lower atmosphere are associated with various factors such as the upwind pattern of CO 2 emissions and uptakes, flight path and its geographical position relative to the locations of emissions and uptakes, and meteorological conditions during each landing and takeoff,\" said Kaz Higuchi, co-author of the study and adjunct professor of Environmental Studies, York University, Canada. \"Despite these complex conditions under which the measurements are made, it was very interesting that we found a relationship between the magnitude of CO 2 variability and CO 2 emissions from a nearby city.\" The results show that the commercial airliner-based CO 2 dataset can consistently provide urban emission estimates when combined with atmospheric modeling framework.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200515085708.htm", "published": "2020-05-15T13:57:08", "title": "A soft touch for robotic hardware: Combined muscles and sensors made from soft materials allow for flexible robots", "text": "Robots can be made from soft materials, but the flexibility of such robots is limited by the inclusion of rigid sensors necessary for their control. Researchers created embedded sensors, to replace rigid sensors, that offer the same functionality but afford the robot greater flexibility. Soft robots can be more adaptable and resilient than more traditional rigid designs. The team used cutting-edge machine learning techniques to create their design.\n\nAutomation is an increasingly important subject, and core to this concept are the often paired fields of robotics and machine learning. The relationship between machine learning and robotics is not just limited to the behavioral control of robots, but is also important for their design and core functions. A robot which operates in the real world needs to understand its environment and itself in order to navigate and perform tasks.\n\nIf the world was entirely predictable, then a robot would be fine moving around without the need to learn anything new about its environment. But reality is unpredictable and ever changing, so machine learning helps robots adapt to unfamiliar situations. Although this is theoretically true for all robots, it is especially important for soft-bodied robots as the physical properties of these are intrinsically less predictable than their rigid counterparts.\n\n\"Take for example a robot with pneumatic artificial muscles (PAM), rubber and fiber-based fluid-driven systems which expand and contract to move,\" said Associate Professor Kohei Nakajima from the Graduate School of Information Science and Technology. \"PAMs inherently suffer random mechanical noise and hysteresis, which is essentially material stress over time. Accurate laser-based monitors help maintain control through feedback, but these rigid sensors restrict a robot's movement, so we came up with something new.\"\n\nNakajima and his team thought if they could model a PAM in real time, then they could maintain good control of it. However, given the ever-changing nature of PAMs, this is not realistic with traditional methods of mechanical modeling. So the team turned to a powerful and established machine learning technique called reservoir computing. This is where information about a system, in this case the PAM, is fed into a special artificial neural network in real time, so the model is ever changing and thus adapts to the environment.\n\n\"We found the electrical resistance of PAM material changes depending on its shape during a contraction. So we pass this data to the network so it can accurately report on the state of the PAM,\" said Nakajima. \"Ordinary rubber is an insulator, so we incorporated carbon into our material to more easily read its varying resistance. We found the system emulated the existing laser-displacement sensor with equally high accuracy in a range of test conditions.\"\n\nThanks to this method, a new generation of soft robotic technology may be possible. This could include robots that work with humans, for example wearable rehabilitation devices or biomedical robots, as the extra soft touch means interactions with them are gentle and safe.\n\n\"Our study suggests reservoir computing could be used in applications besides robotics. Remote-sensing applications, which need real-time information processed in a decentralized manner, could greatly benefit,\" said Nakajima. \"And other researchers who study neuromorphic computing -- intelligent computer systems -- might also be able to incorporate our ideas into their own work to improve the performance of their systems.\"", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164259.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:59", "title": "2D sandwich sees molecules with clarity: Rice University engineers adapt 2D 'sandwich' for surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy", "text": "A sandwich of molybdenum, sulfur and selenium turns out to be deliciously useful for detecting biomolecules.\n\nTests at Rice University's Brown School of Engineering of a two-dimensional Janus compound showed it could be an effective and universal platform for improving the detection of biomolecules via surface-enhanced Raman spectroscopy (SERS).\n\nUsing glucose to test the material proved its ability to boost its Raman enhancement factor by more than 100,000 times, which the researchers say is comparable to the highest-reported enhancement factor for 2D substrates.\n\nSERS is an established technique that enables the detection and identification of small concentrations of molecules -- or even single molecules -- that get close to or adsorbed by metallic surfaces, including nanoparticles. It's often used to detect nanoscale proteins in bodily fluids, helping to detect diseases and determine treatments, and in environmental analysis.\n\nBut metallic SERS media often prompt side reactions that create background noise. Janus MoSSe synthesized at Rice is nonmetallic. \"This work mainly addresses whether we can enhance the target molecules' signal strength,\" said materials scientist and principal investigator Jun Lou. \"We wanted to know if we could make it stand out from the background noise.\"\n\nThe answer was clearly yes, as Lou and his team reported in Nanoscale.\n\nMoSSe introduced by the Lou lab in 2017 was produced by chemical vapor deposition. Molybdenum sits in the middle with a layer of sulfur on one side and another of selenium on the other; hence the two-faced Janus characterization.\n\nThe different electronegativities of each layer make it a SERS superstar, said lead author and Rice alumnus Shuai Jia, a former graduate student in Lou's lab.\n\n\"The dipole created between the top sulfur and the bottom selenium lands out-of-plane, and this creates an electrical field a few nanometers beyond the MoSSe,\" Jia said. That field interacts with molecules that come close, enhancing their vibrational intensity enough to be detected.\n\nThe researchers noted tests with MoSSe also detected molecules of the neurotransmitter dopamine and that the substrate should be adaptable to sense other molecules.\n\nLou said there's room for improvement. \"We're looking at hybrids of MoSSe with some metallic nanoparticles, and also trying to enhance the dipole strength,\" he said.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164258.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:58", "title": "'Lean lab' approach enables quick research ramp down", "text": "When MIT announced in March that most research labs on campus would need to ramp down to help prevent the spread of Covid-19, Canan Dagdeviren's lab was ready.\n\nFor the past two years, Dagdeviren and her lab manager, David Sadat, have run the Conformable Decoders Group using \"lean lab\" management principles, working closely with MIT's Environment, Health and Safety Office (EHS). Every item in their lab has an assigned function and location, and there are strict procedures in place describing how everything is to be used, put away, and replenished. As a result, it took the lab just 15 minutes to close down operations on March 13.\n\n\"Given that everyone in our lab is very well-trained with these checklists, everyone took care of their own experiments and the tools that they use. I was then able to spend the rest of the time before the campus shutdown communicating with my students, motivating them and preparing them mentally for this upcoming period of time,\" says Dagdeviren, an assistant professor in MIT's Media Lab.\n\nThe lean lab approach has had other benefits as well, including cost savings, increased productivity, and a strong safety record, says Dagdeviren, who reported these effects in a paper appearing today in the journal Advanced Intelligent Systems. The paper also offers guidance on how other labs might implement this approach.\n\nSadat and Tolga Durak, the managing director of MIT EHS, are also authors of the paper.\n\nMaximizing resources\n\nDagdeviren joined MIT's Media Lab as an assistant professor in 2017. As a junior faculty member, she had limited funding and space, so she wanted to maximize her use of the resources that she had. Her lab, the Conformable Decoders Group, develops novel materials and devices that can interact with the environment and with living organisms to detect phenomena such as heartbeats, neural activity, and temperature, among many others.\n\nadvertisement\n\nShe spent nine months designing and building her 1,000-square-foot cleanroom -- a type of workspace whose environmental conditions are rigorously controlled to avoid contamination of experiments. She hired Sadat as a senior lab manager, and he suggested implementing an organizational strategy known as 5S. Sadat and Dagdeviren subsequently partnered with EHS on the lean lab project.\n\nThis method, which originated in Japan, is used in industries such as auto manufacturing but has not been widely applied in academic settings. The system consists of five guiding principles to organize a workspace for efficiency and effectiveness: sort, set in order, shine, standardize, and sustain.\n\nWorking closely with Durak, Dagdeviren and Sadat set out to implement this organization approach in their lab, which they call the YellowBox. One major element of the system is the visual organization of everything in the lab, which includes making sure every item has an assigned location. Each item is color-coded according to its function -- raw materials, instruments, hazardous chemicals, etc. -- and its location is outlined in colored tape so it can be easily spotted and later returned to the right spot.\n\n\"The idea behind it is to reduce the amount of mental calculation that a researcher would have to do when they walk in the lab,\" Sadat says. \"Instead of seeing a cluttered lab and taking time, energy, and brain focus to look for a specific tool, they can walk into the lab and see color-coded and highlighted structures and do what they need to do without thinking much about it.\"\n\nDagdeviren's lab also developed standard operating procedures: step-by-step instructions to help researchers carry out complex experiments, to help ensure consistency in their research. This overall system not only improves workflow in the lab, it also has financial benefits. Between 2018 and 2019, the lab reduced its spending on chemicals by 41 percent and its spending on materials by 52 percent. The lab uses a \"just-in-time\" ordering system that works because their setup makes it easy to see when supplies are getting low, so they don't have to store a lot of extra material, or risk having supplies expire before they are used.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThese efforts have also translated to a boost in productivity. Between 2018 and 2019, the lab increased the number of fabricated devices it produced by 119 percent.\n\n\"This is not a practice lab where nothing is happening. This is a lab where novel research is taking place every day,\" Durak says. \"However, this is also a lean laboratory that is efficient, data-driven, productive, and safe.\"\n\nAny potentially hazardous item or chemical is marked in yellow and black, and areas for storing those materials are similarly marked. Because each item in the lab, down to the stools, has an assigned location, it's easier to keep exit pathways clear. Since implementing the 5S system, the lab has had no accidents, injuries, or near misses.\n\nDagdeviren's lab is also the first research group at the Media Lab to receive MIT's Green Lab certification, which recognizes labs that use environmentally sustainable practices to reduce resource consumption, waste, and carbon emissions.\n\nA model for others\n\nWhen Dagdeviren's lab first started up, members spent more than an hour a day on management and cleaning of the lab, but as everyone got used to the routine and the setup, that dropped to about 10 or 15 minutes a day.\n\n\"Initially it was a little bit hard for people to understand and apply, but over time they got enough experience to be used to it,\" Dagdeviren says. \"Now my lab manager can focus on the most important things rather than cleaning the clutter.\"\n\nDagdeviren's students are now continuing their research at home, running computer simulations of experiments in preparation for resuming their experimental work in the lab. When research operations are able to start up again, she expects that the lab will be able to open up nearly as quickly as it was shut down.\n\n\"This lean lab project has really positioned Canan's lab so that when it is time, this lab is going to be able to start operating very rapidly, function very effectively in a socially distanced world, and employ fiscal frugality, right off the bat,\" Durak says.\n\nHe says that EHS hopes to be able to pilot the lean lab approach with other types of labs, such as biology or chemistry labs, or maker spaces.\n\n\"The lean lab project is an exciting project and a true collaboration between the academy and administration with implications that span above and beyond MIT's campus. This project could also serve as a model for labs at other universities, especially those with limited research space,\" he says.\n\nThe research was funded by EHS seed funding and the MIT Media Lab Consortium.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164254.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:54", "title": "Retinal texture could provide early biomarker of Alzheimer's disease", "text": "Biomedical engineers at Duke University have devised a new imaging device capable of measuring both the thickness and texture of the various layers of the retina at the back of the eye. The advance could be used to detect a biomarker of Alzheimer's disease, potentially offering a widespread early warning system for the disease.\n\nThe results appear online on May 13 in the journal Scientific Reports.\n\n\"Previous research has seen a thinning of the retina in Alzheimer's patients, but by adding a light-scattering technique to the measurement, we've found that the retinal nerve fiber layer is also rougher and more disordered,\" said Adam Wax, professor of biomedical engineering at Duke. \"Our hope is that we can use this insight to create an easy and cheap screening device that wouldn't only be available at your doctor's office, but at places like your local pharmacy as well.\"\n\nDiagnoses of Alzheimer's disease are currently only made after a patient begins to show symptoms of cognitive decline. Even then, the only way to definitively determine that Alzheimer's was the cause is with expensive MRI and PET scans or through an autopsy. But if disease progress can be halted through early interventions such as drugs and mental exercise, patients can have a greatly improved quality of life. This is why researchers are looking for biomarkers that could be used as early warning signs of the disease.\n\nOne such potential biomarker comes from the retina, which is literally an extension of the brain and part of the central nervous system. Previous research has shown that Alzheimer's can cause structural changes to the retina, most notably a thinning of the inner retinal layers.\n\n\"The retina can provide easy access to the brain, and its thinning can be indicative of a decrease in the amount of neural tissue, which can mean that Alzheimer's is present,\" said Wax.\n\nadvertisement\n\nOther diseases such as glaucoma and Parkinson's disease, however, can also cause a thinning of the retina. Inconsistent test results might also come from differences between the machines most often used for these types of measurements, optical coherence tomography (OCT) devices, and how researchers use them.\n\nIn the new paper, Wax and his graduate student Ge Song show that the topmost layer of neurons in the retina of a mouse model of Alzheimer's disease exhibit a change in their structural texture. Combined with data on the changes in thickness of this layer, the new measurement could prove to be a more easily accessible biomarker of Alzheimer's.\n\n\"Our new approach can measure the roughness or texture of the nerve fiber layer of the inner retina,\" said Song. \"It can provide a quick and direct way to measure structural changes caused by Alzheimer's, which has great potential as a biomarker of the disease.\"\n\nOCT is the optical analogue of ultrasound. It works by sending waves of light into tissues and measuring how long they take to come back. While it is an extremely useful imaging technique commonly used to make a wide array of diagnoses, it has limitations.\n\nTo gather more data, Wax and Song added a measurement called angle-resolved low-coherence interferometry (a/LCI), which uses the angles of the scattered light to gather more information about the tissue's structure. By combining the two measurements, the researchers can extract both thickness and structural information about each layer of the retina.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"The a/LCI measurements complement the thickness measurements to improve the potential utility of more quantitative biomarkers for Alzheimer's,\" said Song. \"You can't get textural and structural information about the retina with OCT alone. You need both imaging modalities. That's the key innovation.\"\n\nThe researchers are now working to incorporate this added ability into a low-cost OCT system that Wax is developing through a spinoff company called Lumedica. While traditional OCT machines weigh more than 60 pounds, take up an entire desk and cost anywhere between $50,000 and $120,000, Wax's design weighs four pounds, is about the size of a lunch box and, Wax expects, will be sold for less than $15,000.\n\nThe key to Wax's design is a 3D-printed part that uses symmetry to compensate for mechanical inconsistencies that can arise in traditional OCT devices because of things as small as a subtle shift in temperature. Song also has been working on a 3D-printed rotational prism, allowing the a/LCI to scan the entire retina.\n\n\"We're excited because this research shows a new way of using low-cost OCT technologies outside of simply screening for traditional retinal diseases,\" said Wax. \"If we can use these devices as a window into early signs of neurodegenerative diseases, maybe we can help people get into an early intervention treatment program before it's too late.\"\n\nThis research was supported by the National Institutes of Health (R21AG056245, P30EY005722).", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164236.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:36", "title": "Genetic origins of hybrid dysfunction", "text": "In a small pool nestled between two waterfalls in Hidalgo, Mexico, lives a population of hybrid fish -- the result of many generations of interbreeding between highland and sheepshead swordtails. The lab of Molly Schumer, assistant professor of biology at Stanford University, has been collecting these fish for years to study the evolution of hybrids.\n\n\"We're just realizing that hybridization affects species all across the tree of life, including our own species -- many of us carry genes from Neanderthals and Denisovans,\" said Schumer, referring to two ancient human species that interbred with our ancestors. \"Understanding hybridization and the negative and positive effects that can come from genes that have moved between species is important in understanding our own genomes and those of other species with which we interact.\"\n\nIn a new paper, published May 14 in Science, the researchers pinpoint two genes responsible for a melanoma that often develops near the tails of male highland-sheepshead hybrids. The finding marks only the second time that a hybrid dysfunction has been traced to specific genes in vertebrates. (The only other case where scientists have narrowed hybrid dysfunction in vertebrates down to the single-gene level is in a longstanding hybrid population of mice in Europe and their relatives.)\n\nA special population\n\nPeople have long known that the offspring of two different species tend to have genetic flaws. For example, mules -- which are donkeys-horse hybrids -- are infertile. Ironically, in order to find the genes responsible for such dysfunctions, researchers need hybrids that are fit enough to breed for several generations after the initial hybridization. Otherwise, the pieces of their genomes that come from the parental species are so large that it is nearly impossible to trace the influence of any one gene.\n\nThis is what makes the highland-sheepshead hybrids an exceptional case study. They have been interbreeding for about 45 generations, resulting in genomes that contain smaller chunks of parental DNA, which are easier to inspect at a single-gene level.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"We've known about genetic incompatibility between the genes of two species since the 1940s. Despite that, we don't know many of the genes that cause these negative interactions,\" said Daniel Powell, a postdoctoral fellow in the Schumer lab and lead author of the paper. \"Our lab has clearly defined natural hybrids and we've developed the genomic resources for both parental species. These fish represent a unique system for addressing this question.\"\n\nIn order to home in on the genes responsible for melanoma in hybrids, the researchers first turned their attention to the pure sheepshead swordtails and the genetic origin of a black spot some of these fish develop -- which is non-cancerous but found in the same location as the hybrids' melanoma. Analyzing the genomes of nearly 400 individual fish, they linked the black spot with the presence of a gene called xmrk. Following that lead, the researchers concluded that xmrk was also more highly expressed in hybrids with melanoma compared to those without it -- altogether, it could explain 75 percent of all variation in the spotting they studied in both the pure sheepshead and hybrid fishes.\n\nThe researchers also found that another gene called cd97 -- which some hybrids inherit from their highland swordtail ancestors -- was more highly expressed in the highland swordtails and in hybrids than in sheepshead swordtails. Further genetic evidence suggests that cd97 and xmrk interact in some way to produce melanoma in the hybrids.\n\nInterestingly, even though neither gene is associated with melanoma in the parental swordtails species, they're both linked to cancer in other animals. In a distantly related swordtail hybrid, for example, xmrk interacts with another gene -- not cd97 -- to cause melanoma, and a gene related to cd97 has been associated with cancer in humans.\n\nTaken together, these findings yield a puzzling picture. \"We've ended up with competing but not mutually exclusive ideas about hybrid incompatibility and disease,\" said Powell. \"We've lent credibility to the idea that some genes might be vulnerable to breaking down in different species -- which is surprising, given the randomness of evolution. But we also have evidence for the idea that there is a diversity of genetic causes for similar dysfunctions.\"\n\nThe best kind of project\n\nSchumer says she took a bit of a gamble when she focused her studies on hybridization, but her bet is paying off.\n\n\"When I started my PhD in 2011, it was really not accepted that hybridization was common in animals. The best-known examples were mules and fruit flies. It's been such a massive shift and a fun time to be working on this question,\" said Schumer, who is senior author of the paper and a member of Stanford Bio-X. \"What we've arrived at now is the best kind of project in science: one that raises way more questions than answers and spins you off in a bunch of different directions.\"\n\nThrough future work, the researchers want to figure out why hybrid swordtails with melanoma are less likely to survive in the wild and in captivity. They are also curious to know why so many of these fish have the melanoma -- it's possible that, when it comes to mate selection, females prefer males with the large black spots generated by melanoma. Already, they have lined up several ideas to further understand whether genes go wrong in a repeatable way in hybrids, or if what they've found in xmrk and cd97 is closer to coincidence.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164234.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:34", "title": "Saving livestock by thinking like a predator: Preventing endangered carnivores from eating valuable livestock may require going back to Ecology 101", "text": "For predators like wolves, cougars and snow leopards, a cow or sheep out to pasture may make for an easy and tasty meal. But when wild animals eat livestock, farmers face the traumatic loss of food or income, frequently sparking lethal conflicts between humans and their carnivorous neighbors.\n\nHumans have struggled to reduce the loss of livestock to carnivores for thousands of years, and yet, solutions remain elusive. According to a new study led by researchers at the University of California, Berkeley, solving this ancient puzzle requires going back to Ecology 101.\n\nEffectively reducing encounters between domestic prey and wild predators, the researchers argue, requires knowing the principles governing the ecological interactions among these players and their surrounding landscape. Simply put, getting in the mind of predators -- considering the ecology of how they hunt, how their prey behaves and how they interact with the landscape around them -- will help farmers and wildlife managers target interventions to discourage wild carnivores from preying on valuable livestock.\n\n\"There is no 'one-size-fits-all' solution for livestock predation, because the variables at play change, depending on the stakeholders, the landscape and the carnivores and livestock involved -- as well the scale and cost of management tools,\" said Christine Wilkinson, a graduate student in environmental science, policy and management at UC Berkeley and lead author on the study, which appeared this week in the journal Conservation Biology. \"But at the core of the problem is an ecological act: predation.\"\n\nIn addition to lethal means of warding off potential predators, like poisoning or hunting, a variety of nonlethal deterrents are available. Guardian dogs, lights, electric fencing or bright-colored flags can all keep carnivores at bay while preserving the local ecology. Other strategies, like regularly moving livestock to different pastures or keeping them inside an enclosure at night, can make it harder for carnivores to locate and hunt them.\n\nBut the same techniques that prevent wolves from eating sheep in the rocky valleys of Idaho may not be as effective at preventing snow leopards from killing livestock in the high elevations of the Himalayas. Instead of focusing on the overall effectiveness of any one technique, the authors urge wildlife managers to approach the problem by considering a framework that includes the carnivore ecology, the livestock ecology and how the two species interact with the landscape around them.\n\n\"By knowing the full ecological story, we can tinker with the tools in our management toolkit to keep both predators and livestock safe,\" said Defenders of Wildlife senior scientist and co-author Jennie Miller.\n\nFor instance, wolves are known to be afraid of strings of red flags called fladry, and using fladry around a pasture might be a cost-effective method for keeping the predators away from sheep. But considering other aspects of the ecology, such as where the pastures are located, or where the sheep are kept at night, could yield even better results, depending on context.\n\nThese strategic combinations of deterrents have successfully kept predators at bay in a variety of settings, the paper points out. The authors highlight three case studies from around the world, demonstrating the success that can occur when ecology is the foundation of targeted interventions, and the failure that can occur when it is ignored.\n\nThe study's framework provides guidance for livestock managers to consider their management techniques as a component of livestock ecology. \"Livestock have, in some sense, been bred to be an easy target for carnivores,\" Wilkinson said. \"Humans have to recreate the defenses that we bred away.\"\n\nThe next step for the researchers is applying this framework to provide livestock managers with concrete tools to mitigate conflict as part of a larger, collaborative research and outreach effort based in the Brashares Group at UC Berkeley.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514164231.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T21:42:31", "title": "Largest and hottest shield volcano on Earth", "text": "In a recently published study, researchers from the University of Hawai'i at M\u0101noa School of Ocean and Earth Science and Technology revealed the largest and hottest shield volcano on Earth. A team of volcanologists and ocean explorers used several lines of evidence to determine P\u016bh\u0101honu, a volcano within the Papah\u0101naumoku\u0101kea Marine National Monument now holds this distinction.\n\nGeoscientists and the public have long thought Mauna Loa, a culturally-significant and active shield volcano on the Big Island of Hawai'i, was the largest volcano in the world. However, after surveying the ocean floor along the mostly submarine Hawaiian leeward volcano chain, chemically analyzing rocks in the UH M\u0101noa rock collection, and modeling the results of these studies, the research team came to a new conclusion. P\u016bh\u0101honu, meaning 'turtle rising for breath' in Hawaiian, is nearly twice as big as Mauna Loa.\n\n\"It has been proposed that hotspots that produce volcano chains like Hawai'i undergo progressive cooling over 1-2 million years and then die,\" said Michael Garcia, lead author of the study and retired professor of Earth Sciences at SOEST. \"However, we have learned from this study that hotspots can undergo pulses of melt production. A small pulse created the Midway cluster of now extinct volcanoes and another, much bigger one created P\u016bh\u0101honu. This will rewrite the textbooks on how mantle plumes work.\"\n\nIn 1974, P\u016bh\u0101honu (then called Gardner Pinnacles) was suspected as the largest Hawaiian volcano based on very limited survey data. Subsequent studies of the Hawaiian Islands concluded that Mauna Loa was the largest volcano but they included the base of the volcano that is below sea level that was not considered in the 1974 study. The new comprehensive surveying and modeling, using methods similar to those used for Mauna Loa show that P\u016bh\u0101honu is the largest.\n\nThis study highlights Hawaiian volcanoes, not only now but for millions of years, have been erupting some of the hottest magma on Earth.

Strong lenses can have 100 billion times more mass than our sun, causing light from more distant objects in the same path to magnify and split, for example, into multiple images, or to appear as dramatic arcs or rings.\n\nThe major limitation of strong gravitational lenses has been their scarcity, with only several hundred confirmed since the first observation in 1979, but that's changing ... and fast.\n\nA new study by an international team of scientists revealed 335 new strong lensing candidates based on a deep dive into data collected for a U.S. Department of Energy-supported telescope project in Arizona called the Dark Energy Spectroscopic Instrument (DESI). The study, published May 7 in The Astrophysical Journal, benefited from the winning machine-learning algorithm in an international science competition.\n\n\"Finding these objects is like finding telescopes that are the size of a galaxy,\" said David Schlegel, a senior scientist in Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's (Berkeley Lab's) Physics Division who participated in the study. \"They're powerful probes of dark matter and dark energy.\"\n\nThese newly discovered gravitational lens candidates could provide specific markers for precisely measuring distances to galaxies in the ancient universe if supernovae are observed and precisely tracked and measured via these lenses, for example.\n\nadvertisement\n\nStrong lenses also provide a powerful window into the unseen universe of dark matter, which makes up about 85 percent of the matter in the universe, as most of the mass responsible for lensing effects is thought to be dark matter. Dark matter and the accelerating expansion of the universe, driven by dark energy, are among the biggest mysteries that physicists are working to solve.\n\nIn the latest study, researchers enlisted Cori, a supercomputer at Berkeley Lab's National Energy Research Scientific Computing Center (NERSC), to automatically compare imaging data from the Dark Energy Camera Legacy Survey (DECaLS) -- one of three surveys conducted in preparation for DESI -- with a training sample of 423 known lenses and 9,451 non-lenses.\n\nThe researchers grouped the candidate strong lenses into three categories based on the likelihood that they are, in fact, lenses: Grade A for the 60 candidates that are most likely to be lenses, Grade B for the 105 candidates with less pronounced features, and Grade C for the 176 candidate lenses that have fainter and smaller lensing features than those in the other two categories.\n\nXiaosheng Huang, the study's lead author, noted that the team already succeeded in winning time on the Hubble Space Telescope to confirm some of the most promising lensing candidates revealed in the study, with observing time on the Hubble that began in late 2019.\n\n\"The Hubble Space Telescope can see the fine details without the blurring effects of Earth's atmosphere,\" Huang said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe lens candidates were identified with the assistance of a neural network, which is a form of artificial intelligence in which the computer program is trained to gradually improve its image-matching over time to provide an increasing success rate in identifying lenses. Computerized neural networks are inspired by the biological network of neurons in the human brain.\n\n\"It takes hours to train the neural network,\" Huang said. \"There is a very sophisticated fitting model of 'What is a lens?' and 'What is not a lens?'\"\n\nThere was some painstaking manual analysis of lensing images to help pick the best images to train the network from tens of thousands of images, Huang noted. He recalled one Saturday during which he sat down with student researchers for the entire day to pore over tens of thousands of images to develop sample lists of lenses and non-lenses.\n\n\"We didn't just select these at random,\" Huang said. \"We had to augment this set with hand-selected examples that look like lenses but are not lenses,\" for example, \"and we selected those that could be potentially confusing.\"\n\nStudent involvement was key in the study, he added. \"The students worked diligently on this project and solved many tough problems, all while taking a full load of classes,\" he said.

While an estimated 1 in 10,000 galaxies acts as a lens, the neural network can eliminate most of the non-lenses. \"Rather than going through 10,000 images to find one, now we have just a few tens,\" he said.\n\nThe neural network was originally developed for The Strong Gravitational Lens Finding Challenge, a programming competition that ran from November 2016 to February 2017 that motivated the development of automated tools for finding strong lenses.\n\nWith a growing body of observational data, and new telescope projects like DESI and the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST) that is now scheduled to start up in 2023, there is heated competition to mine this data using sophisticated artificial intelligence tools, Schlegel said.\n\n\"That competition is good,\" he said. A team based in Australia, for example, also found many new lensing candidates using a different approach. \"About 40 percent of what they found we didn't,\" and likewise the study that Schlegel participated in found many lensing candidates that the other team hadn't.\n\nHuang said the team has expanded its search for lenses in other sources of sky-imaging data, and the team is also considering whether to plug into a broader set of computing resources to expedite the hunt.\n\n\"The goal for us is to reach 1,000\" new lensing candidates, Schlegel said.\n\nNERSC is a DOE Office of Science User Facility.\n\nStudy participants included researchers from the University of San Francisco, Berkeley Lab, the National Optical Astronomy Observatory, Siena College, the University of Wyoming, the University of Arizona, the University of Toronto and the Perimeter Institute for Theoretical Physics in Canada, and Universit\u00e9 Paris-Saclay in France.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143558.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:35:58", "title": "Multiscale crop modeling effort required to assess climate change adaptation", "text": "Crop modeling is essential for understanding how to secure the food supply as the planet adapts to climate change.

As noted by the authors, the large-scale surveillance of coronaviruses in these animals, called pangolins, could improve our understanding of the spectrum of coronaviruses circulating in the wild, and could help prevent and control emerging infectious diseases.\n\nLast December, an outbreak of the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) emerged in Wuhan, China. Recent studies have shown that severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) -- the virus that causes COVID-19 -- could have originated in bats. But SARS-CoV-2 may have spilled over to humans from another intermediate host, and the source of this virus is still unknown. To effectively control the disease and prevent new spillovers, it is critical to identify the animal origin of this newly emerging coronavirus. In the new study, Chen and colleagues examined whether pangolins could be an intermediate host for SARS-CoV-2.\n\nThe researchers assembled the whole genome of a coronavirus identified in two groups of sick Malayan pangolins. The results suggest that the pangolin coronavirus is genetically associated with SARS-CoV-2 and a group of bat coronaviruses. But further analysis suggests that SARS-CoV-2 did not arise directly from the pangolin coronavirus. Although this study does not support the idea that pangolins are an intermediate host directly responsible for the emergence of SARS-CoV-2, it is possible that other coronaviruses could be circulating in pangolins. According to the authors, wildlife conservation and limited exposure to wildlife will be important to minimize the risk that coronaviruses will spill over from wild animals to humans.\n\nThe authors state, \"Pangolins could be natural hosts of Betacoronaviruses with an unknown potential to infect humans.

The disease's telltale signs -- cyclical fevers and chills -- are caused by successive broods of parasites multiplying in sync inside red blood cells, then bursting out in unison every few days.\n\nNow, a study shows that even when grown outside the body, malaria parasites can still keep a beat.\n\nReporting in the May 15 issue of the journal Science, researchers have uncovered rhythms in the parasite's gene activity levels that don't rely on time cues from the host, but instead are coordinated from within the parasite itself.\n\nThe findings indicate that the parasite that causes malaria has its own timekeeping machinery; an internal metronome that ticks of its own accord and causes thousands of parasite genes to ramp up and down at regular intervals.\n\n\"Malaria has all the molecular signatures of a clock,\" said Duke biology professor Steven Haase, the lead author of the study.\n\nUnderstanding how malaria's clock works might help develop new weapons against a disease that kills a child every two minutes, and has proven increasingly resistant to existing drugs, Haase said.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHaase has spent years studying cell cycles in yeast to understand controls on the timing of events as one cell becomes two. But only recently has he turned to malaria. The work was prompted by a question that has vexed scientists: how do the parasites keep time?\n\nResearchers have long known that all the malaria parasites within an infected person's body -- millions of them -- move through their cell cycle at the same time. They invade red blood cells, proliferate and erupt out in synchronous waves, releasing new parasites that invade other red blood cells, and the cycle starts anew. But whether the parasites were actively coordinating their own schedule or merely responding to the daily circadian rhythms of their human host was a mystery.\n\nIn the new study, the scientists grew four strains of the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum in human red blood cells in the lab, where they were isolated from daily fluctuations in their host's body temperature, melatonin levels and other bodily rhythms.\n\nTogether with colleagues from Walter Reed Army Institute of Research, Florida Atlantic University and Montana State University, the team extracted the parasites' RNA every three hours for up to three days, and looked at when each gene was activated and what its level of expression was.\n\nThe researchers noted that, even without clues from a host, all the parasites within a given strain kept in step. Roughly 90% of the genes they examined appear to be clock-controlled, rising and falling in a predictable fashion, and with a sequence that repeats itself, over and over.\n\nadvertisement\n\nAnalyses show that the malaria clock keeps time just as well as the biological clocks that control sleep cycles, metabolism and other circadian rhythms in humans and other animals, said co-author Francis Motta, assistant professor of mathematics at Florida Atlantic University.\n\nThe team's findings are supported by a separate study of mice infected with malaria, also appearing in the May 15 issue of Science, led by circadian rhythms expert Joseph Takahashi, an HHMI investigator at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center.\n\nWhile very little of malaria's genome resembles clock genes found in other organisms, \"it's how the genes are arranged in a network that's important,\" Haase said.\n\nOther biological clocks consists of a network of interconnected genes that are switched on until the proteins they produce start to build up. In a chemical feedback loop, the higher concentration of proteins then acts to shut down the genes that made them.\n\nAs a next step, the team is looking into whether there is any crosstalk between the malaria clock and the clock ticking inside the cells of the human immune system.\n\nThe thinking is that parasites that are able to anticipate when their host's defenses are likely to be down can adjust the timing of their escape from red blood cells, possibly giving them an edge over more rhythmically challenged counterparts.\n\nIf we can figure out if and how the malaria parasite synchronizes the ticking of its clock with that of its host, Haase said, we might be able to disrupt those signals and help the human immune system better fight these invaders.\n\nThis research was supported by the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency (D12AP00025), the National Institutes of Health (R01 GM126555-01), and the National Science Foundation (DMS-1839299).

The team's findings were based on experiments in mice, while an accompanying paper, by biologist Steven Haase's team at Duke University, reports similar findings in the malaria parasite that infects humans.\n\nThe discovery overturns decades of conventional wisdom about the malaria parasite and raises the possibility of new treatments for the disease in the years ahead. Malaria kills around 400,000 people per year worldwide and remains a leading cause of death in many tropical nations, particularly among young children.\n\nScientists could potentially harness the parasite's biological rhythms to disrupt its invasion of humans' cells, says Takahashi, a neuroscientist at the University of Texas Southwestern Medical Center. Thousands of the parasite's genes turn on and off in a rhythmic fashion, he found, likely influencing a broad suite of physiological processes.\n\n\"It's as if the entire parasite is under this 24-hour program,\" he says. \"We think that if we can figure out what controls that program, we'd have a new target to try to inhibit the life cycle of the parasite.\"\n\nMatter of time\n\nCircadian clocks, which control metabolism on a daily rhythm, are important in virtually all living things, from bacteria to plants and animals. But little is known about the role of daily rhythms in parasites, which also have to contend with their hosts' clocks.\n\nadvertisement\n\nIn malaria, Plasmodium parasites grow inside the host's red blood cells and destroy them, triggering fevers and other symptoms. Doctors have long noticed that these fevers are rhythmic, recurring every 24, 48, or 72 hours depending on the species of Plasmodium. But scientists have assumed the parasite merely follows its host's 24-hour rhythm.\n\nTakahashi, who discovered the genetic basis for mammals' circadian clocks in the 1990s, suspected that the parasite might set its own rhythm. He and postdoc Filipa Rijo-Ferreira had observed something similar in another kind of parasite.\n\nRijo-Ferreira and Takahashi discovered in 2017 that the parasite that causes sleeping sickness has its own circadian rhythm. In 2018, they reported that the parasite shifts its host's circadian clock, making people sleep during the day instead of at night. The idea that parasites have internal clocks \"just exploded my imagination,\" Rijo-Ferreira says. Until then, no one had reported such a timing mechanism in a parasite. After that, malaria, with its cycling fevers, seemed like the most promising place to look.\n\nTakahashi and Rijo-Ferreira, who pioneered the project in the lab, conducted a series of experiments using mice and the malaria parasite that infects them, Plasmodium chabaudi. First, they demonstrated that the parasite's rhythm persists in constant darkness and regardless of host feeding, with 4,000 of the parasite's roughly 5,000 genes cycling in their levels of activity. Then they showed that the parasite can shift its daily rhythm and that its rhythm persists even in mice genetically altered to have no rhythm of their own.\n\nThe group's discovery of a clock controlling host-pathogen dynamics highlights \"the fundamental and expansive role of circadian clocks in human health and disease,\" says Duke's Haase, whose team's results in the same issue of Science demonstrate an internal rhythm in a malaria parasite species that infects humans, Plasmodium falciparum.\n\nadvertisement\n\nHaase and Takahashi discovered by chance that they were working on the same question using different malaria parasite species, and they coordinated to publish their findings together. \"It was a phenomenal act of collegiality,\" Haase says.\n\nStop the clock\n\nUltimately, the researchers want to throw a wrench in the parasite's clockworks. Haase hopes that his and Takahashi's teams will figure out how the host and parasite rhythms interact, revealing new targets for therapies. That's the \"moon shot,\" he says.\n\nThere are currently no drugs that target the circadian clock, but the idea is gaining traction, Takahashi says. What's more, \"the efficacy of different drugs varies with time of day,\" he says. For example, some cholesterol-lowering drugs are taken at the end of the day to better work with our circadian rhythms, as cholesterol is produced mainly at night.\n\nIn the case of malaria, Plasmodium parasites are already showing signs of resistance to existing drugs. The new study hopefully opens the door to \"exploring whether the timing at which you give a drug can make it more effective,\" Rijo-Ferreira says.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143535.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:35:35", "title": "'Metabolic signature' can determine adherence to Mediterranean diet, help predict CVD risk", "text": "A newly identified \"metabolic signature\" can evaluate an individual's adherence and metabolic response to the Mediterranean diet and help predict future risk of developing cardiovascular disease (CVD), according to new research led by Harvard T.H.

The model identified 67 metabolites that when analyzed collectively indicated whether a person had followed the Mediterranean diet and showed how the person responded to the diet, which is high in unsaturated fats and emphasizes plant-based foods, fish, and olive oil, and has shown to be effective in reducing the risk of CVD and overall mortality. The study also showed that a higher level of the metabolic signature was associated with a lower long-term risk of CVD among PREDIMED study participants. Even after accounting for traditional CVD risk factors, the metabolic signature was effective at predicting long-term risk of CVD, the researchers said.\n\nThe researchers further tested and verified the metabolic signature in blood samples from 6,868 participants from the U.S.-based Nurses' Health Study, Nurses' Health Study II, and Health Professional's Follow-Up Survey. They noted that ability for the signature to determine adherence and metabolic response to the Mediterranean diet, and to predict future CVD risk, were highly reproducible across all the study populations despite the fact that individuals living in Spain and in the U.S. have different dietary habits, lifestyles, and environmental exposures.\n\n\"This study is the first to develop a metabolic signature for the Mediterranean diet based on comprehensive metabolomic profiles.

They undertake late fall migrations to southern waters, before returning to the Chesapeake Bay to spawn the next spring. They leave a few weeks after spawning to return to the ocean.\n\nThe small resident striped bass that remain in the Chesapeake Bay experience mortality rates of 70% per year, nearly twice as high as those that migrate to ocean waters.

Measurements were made while the animals performed naturalistic visual behaviours including social interactions with other mice and visual object tracking. While the eyes in humans typically move together in the same direction, those in mice often moved in opposite directions. Although humans also make eye movement without head movement, for example when reading a book, the study found that mouse eye movements were always linked to head movement.\n\nThe researchers identified two types of mouse eye movement coupled to head movement with different functions: 'head tilt compensation' and 'saccade and fixate' eye movements. 'Head tilt compensation' allows mice to maintain a consistent view of the world by compensating for slow changes in head tilt, and results in the two eyes moving in opposite directions, which is typically not observed in humans. 'Saccade and fixate' eye movements allow animals to stabilise their view during fast head rotations and shift their gaze in the direction of the head rotation. These 'saccade and fixate' movements are similar to those seen in humans and monkeys, which often sample their environment by a sequence of stable images (fixations) and result in the two eyes moving in the same direction. 'Fixate' eye movements keep the flow of visual information steady while 'saccade' movements allow the animal to select relevant visual information to focus on.\n\nThe mouse is an important species to help understand how the human brain functions. First, the organisation and function of the mouse and human brain is similar in many ways, although there are also important differences. Second, scientists can use unique genetic research tools in mice to study brain circuits at a level of detail not possible in other mammals. Third, scientists use genetic tools in mice to model human brain disorders.\n\nThe traditional approach to studying vision in humans, monkeys and mice involves restraining head movement. While this facilitates the interpretation of data and allows researchers to use a wider range of experimental measuring methods, it has been unclear whether the results can be generalised to naturalistic behaviours where both head and eyes are free to move. Understanding how mice visually sample their surroundings is also crucial to further close the gap between vision and navigation which has traditionally been studied in freely moving rodents.\n\nThis research validates using mice to study important aspects of how humans select visual features that are most important for navigation and decision-making. This visual process is impaired in multiple neurological and neuropsychiatric disorders, including schizophrenia, Alzheimer's disease and stroke.

The study, conducted by members of the Pediatric Nephrology Dialysis Unit at Riley Hospital for Children at IU Health, used antibody testing on patients, doctors, nurses and staff within the unit to track symptomatic and asymptomatic spread in a confined space, such as a dialysis unit.\n\n\"There are unique exposure challenges in dialysis units that limit social distancing efforts, including open bay formats and rotating nursing assignments,\" said David Hains, MD, lead investigator on the study. \"Dialysis units find threat among many infectious diseases and COVID-19 is dangerous to patients receiving dialysis.\"\n\nStudies from Wuhan, China show the spread of COVID-19 among dialysis units, but this study is the first of its kind in a pediatric setting, as well as being one that used antibody status as a determining factor.\n\n\"Our study also highlights the importance of distancing and PPE,\" said Hains, division chief of pediatric nephrology in the Department of Pediatrics. \"We saw a dramatic decrease in 'new' cases as we implemented more aggressive measures to protect our patients and staff. More studies to examine this are underway by a number of people here on campus.\"\n\nThe group's study tracked 13 patients, 11 nurses, four staff and 10 physicians. By day 21 of the study, 11 health care workers and three patients had positive COVID-19 antibodies. No participants developed symptoms between days seven and 21.\n\n\"This study found a high occurrence of COVID-19 antibodies in individuals interacting in a pediatric dialysis unit. This high rate of occurrence suggests that more health care workers may be antibody-positive than would otherwise be expected,\" Hains said. \"Testing for the presence of these antibodies can allow for strategically staffing the care of patients who have COVID-19, or who are suspected to be positive, with nurses and physicians who also have tested positive for these antibodies.\"\n\nHains said that a nurse who was participating in the study did not exhibit any of the symptoms of the virus and had a positive antibody test. She subsequently had a COVID-19 PCR test, which came back positive. Because of that test, Hains said, his group was able to react quickly to the situation.\n\n\"When she had a COVID-19 test, she was positive. That allowed us to rapidly quarantine her, which may have helped prevent the spread in our unit,\" Hains said. \"I can see this being utilized in other healthcare settings or arenas where distancing is not easily done.\"\n\nAs social distancing regulations begin to loosen across the state, Hains and his team, including Department of Pediatrics faculty Andrew Schwaderer, MD, Aaron Carroll, MD, Amy Wilson, MD, and Michelle Starr, MD, plan to continue this study to see the impact these changes have on their numbers.

Prior to the COVID-19 pandemic, in cities where bike-share systems have been introduced, bike commuting increased by 20%, said Dafeng Xu, an assistant professor in the University of Washington's Evans School of Public Policy & Governance. Xu studied U.S. cities with and without bike-share systems, using Census and company data to analyze how commuting patterns change when bike shares become available.\n\n\"This study shows that bike-share systems can drive a population to commute by bike,\" said Xu, whose study was published May 11 in the Journal of Policy Analysis and Management.\n\nBike-share systems, common in cities in Europe and Asia, were launched in four U.S. cities in 2010 and as of 2016 had grown to more than 50. Not all systems have been successful: Convenience -- how easy it is to find and rent a bike -- is the key. In Seattle, for example, a city-owned bike-share program failed in 2017 due largely to a limited number of bikes and a lack of infrastructure, but private companies in the same market thrived prior to the pandemic.\n\n[Around the world, cities have enacted mobility restrictions during the coronavirus outbreak. The responses of bike-share companies, and bike-share usage, have varied by community.]\n\nAmong other interests in transportation and immigration policy, Xu researches the effects of bicycling on the environment and human health, and on the ways bike-share systems can play a role by expanding access to cycling.\n\nadvertisement\n\n\"In general, biking is good and healthy, and it means less pollution and traffic, but it can be expensive, and people worry about their bikes being stolen, things like that,\" Xu said. \"Bike share solves some of these problems, because people don't need to worry about the cost and theft.\"\n\nFor this study, Xu sorted through nine years of demographic and commute statistics from the American Community Survey, a detailed, annual report by the Census Bureau. He then examined bike-share company data (through the National Association of City Transportation Officials) from 38 cities with systems, focusing on trips logged during morning and afternoon rush hours. By comparing the number, location and time of work-related bike commutes from Census data against bike-share company records of trips logged, both before and after the launch of bike shares, Xu was able to estimate the use of bike shares for commute trips.\n\nXu found that in both bike-share and non-bike-share cities, the rate of bike commuting increased, while car commuting decreased, from 2008-2016. However, the rate of bike commuting -- and the use of public transportation -- was significantly greater in bike-share cities.\n\nFor example, in bike-share cities in 2008, roughly 66% of commuters drove to work, about 1% biked, and 22% took transit. That compared to non-bike-share cities, where about 88% of commuters drove, fewer than 1% biked, and 4% took transit.\n\nBy 2016 -- after many bike-share systems had launched -- car commuting had fallen to 59% in bike-share cities, while bike commuting had climbed to 1.7% and transit to 26%. Commuting by car in non-bike-share cities had slipped to 83% in 2016, while bike commuting had grown to 1%, and transit to 6%.\n\nadvertisement\n\nNationwide, 0.6% of commuters bike to work, according to an American Community Survey report in 2017.\n\nIn general, cities with larger bike-share systems also experienced sharper increases in bicycle commuting, Xu said.\n\n\"This is not surprising: A large bike-share system means a higher density of public bicycles and is thus more accessible by commuters,\" he said. \"In contrast, sadly, Seattle's Pronto struggled to attract commuters and was finally doomed only after three years of operation partially due to its relatively small size.\"\n\nIn his paper, Xu points to Chicago, which operates a municipally owned bike-share system called Divvy. Prior to Divvy's launch in 2013, 1.5% of commuters biked to work, Xu said, but afterward, that rate grew to 2%.\n\nThe trends held, he said, even when controlling for a city's expansion of protected bike lanes -- another significant factor in whether people choose to bike to work, according to other research.\n\nOverall, the numbers before COVID-19 were promising, Xu said. The numbers could grow, he said, if communities and bike-share companies make changes that can boost the appeal of bike commuting: adding bike lanes to city streets, expanding programs to outlying communities, or increasing the allowable rental time. Many bike shares, for instance, last only up to a half-hour before a user has to pay for a new trip.\n\nXu is also the author of a previous paper analyzed the impact of bike-share systems on obesity rates.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2020/05/200514143510.htm", "published": "2020-05-14T19:35:10", "title": "Surplus antioxidants are pathogenic for hearts and skeletal muscle: This discovery may have clinical importance in management of heart failure", "text": "Many heart diseases are linked to oxidative stress, an overabundance of reactive oxygen species. The body reacts to reduce oxidative stress -- where the redox teeter-totter has gone too far up -- through production of endogenous antioxidants that reduce the reactive oxygen species. This balancing act is called redox homeostasis.\n\nBut what happens if the redox teeter-totter goes too far down, creating antioxidative stress, also known as reductive stress? Rajasekaran Namakkal-Soorappan, Ph.D., associate professor in the University of Alabama at Birmingham Department of Pathology, and colleagues have found that reductive stress, or RS/AS, is also pathological. This discovery, they say, may have clinical importance in management of heart failure.\n\nThey report that RS causes pathological heart enlargement and diastolic dysfunction in a mouse model. This study, published in the journal Antioxidants and Redox Signaling, was led by Namakkal-Soorappan and Pei Ping, Ph.D., David Geffen School of Medicine at the University of California-Los Angeles.\n\n\"Antioxidant-based therapeutic approaches for human heart failure should consider a thorough evaluation of antioxidant levels before the treatment,\" they said. \"Our findings demonstrate that chronic RS is intolerable and adequate to induce heart failure.\"\n\nThe study used transgenic mice that had upregulated genes for antioxidants in the heart, which increased the amounts of antioxidant proteins and reduced glutathione, creating RS. One mouse line had low upregulation, and one had high upregulation, creating chronic low RS and chronic high RS, respectively, in the hearts of the mice.\n\nThe mice with high RS showed pathological heart changes called hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and had an abnormally high heart ejection fraction and diastolic dysfunction at 6 months of age. Sixty percent of the high-RS mice died by 18 months of age.\n\nadvertisement\n\nThe mice with low RS had normal survival rates, but they developed the heart changes at about 15 months of age, suggesting that even moderate RS can lead to irreversible damage in the heart over time.\n\nGiving high-RS mice a chemical that blocked biosynthesis of glutathione, beginning at about 6 weeks of age, prevented RS and rescued the mice from pathological heart changes.\n\nGobinath Shanmugam, Ph.D., postdoctoral fellow in the UAB Department of Pathology, and Namakkal-Soorappan point out that a 2019 survey found about 77 percent of Americans are consuming dietary supplements every day, and within this group, about 58 percent are consuming antioxidants as multivitamins. Thus, a chronic consumption of antioxidant drugs by any individual without knowing their redox state might result in RS, which can induce pathology and slowly damage the heart.\n\nEffect of RS on skeletal muscle\n\nIn a related study, published in the journal Redox Biology, Namakkal-Soorappan looked at the impact of RS on myosatellite cells, which are also known as muscle stem cells. These cells, located near skeletal muscle fibers, are able to regenerate and differentiate into skeletal muscle after acute or chronic muscle injury. The regulation of myosatellite cells is of interest given the loss of skeletal muscle mass during aging or in chronic conditions like diabetes and AIDS.\n\nRecently, Namakkal-Soorappan reported that tilting the redox teeter-totter to oxidative stress impaired regeneration of skeletal muscle. Now, in the Redox Biology paper, he has shown that tilting the redox to RS also causes significant inhibition of muscle satellite cell differentiation.\n\nRather than genetic manipulation to induce RS, as was done in the heart study, the researchers used the chemical sulforaphane or direct augmentation of intracellular glutathione to induce RS in cultured mouse myoblast cells. Both treatments inhibited myoblast differentiation. Finally, authors attempted to withdraw antioxidative stress by growing cells in medium without sulforaphane, which removes the RS and accelerates the differentiation. Namakkal-Soorappan and colleagues found that a pro-oxidative milieu, through a mild generation of reactive oxygen species, was required for myoblast differentiation.\n\nThe researchers also showed that genetic silencing of a negative regulator of the antioxidant genes also inhibited myoblast differentiation.", "author": []}]}, "economist_business": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/business-finance/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/business", "articles": []}, "economist_science_and_tech": {"rss": "https://www.economist.com/sections/science-technology/rss.xml", "link": "https://www.economist.com/topics/science", "articles": []}, "fivethirtyeight_science": {"rss": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/feed/", "link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/science/", "articles": [{"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-close-are-we-to-herd-immunity/", "published": "2020-05-15T15:33:54", "title": "How Close Are We To Herd Immunity?", "text": "This week on FiveThirtyEight\u2019s COVID-19 podcast, PODCAST-19, we hear some good news about COVID-19 antibodies both in humans and \u2026 llamas?!

Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.", "text": "Democrats Say The Worst Of The Coronavirus Is Yet To Come. Republicans Say The Worst Is Over.\n\nWelcome to Pollapalooza, our weekly polling roundup.\n\nPoll(s) of the week\n\nSo far, Americans have largely supported using social distancing to slow the spread of the new coronavirus. According to a Washington Post/University of Maryland poll published this week, most Americans agree that it\u2019s necessary to wear a mask, stay at home when possible, avoid gatherings and keep 6 feet away from others in public. And while Democrats are more likely than Republicans to say these measures are important, sizable majorities in both parties still agree that they are necessary. But while Americans are mostly on the same page about current social distancing measures, there are also signs that they increasingly disagree about where the crisis is headed, with Democrats saying the worst is yet to come and Republicans saying the worst is behind us.\n\nAccording to a CNN poll released this week, nearly three-quarters of Democrats said the worst of the crisis is still ahead of us, while only about a quarter of Republicans said the same. This marked a 15 percentage-point drop among Democrats since CNN last asked the question in April, and a 44-point drop among Republicans. A YouGov/Economist poll also found a similar divide this week; 58 percent of Democrats said the pandemic is going to get worse compared with only 20 percent of Republicans. (The pollster included a third choice, \u201cWe are currently in the worst part of the pandemic,\u201d which just over 20 percent of both Democrats and Republicans chose.) And a daily tracking poll conducted by Navigator Research also found that between mid-April and early May, the share of Americans who thought the worst was yet to come declined sharply. However, that number has been ticking back up again since May 4, which may reflect increased concern that the virus will spread as more states begin to ease restrictions on businesses and public gatherings.\n\nThe polls this week also show that Americans are adjusting their expectations about when the need for social distancing is likely to end. According to the Washington Post/University of Maryland poll, two-thirds of Americans think that it will be at least the end of July before people can safely gather in groups of 10 or more, up from 45 percent who thought so a month ago. This month\u2019s total includes 80 percent of Democrats and 54 of Republicans. And this week\u2019s YouGov/Economist poll found that a 47 percent plurality \u2014 including a third of Republicans and almost two-thirds of Democrats \u2014 believe it will be at least September before it is safe to end social distancing measures.\n\nConcerns about catching the virus have stayed fairly consistent over the month of May so far. According to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s coronavirus poll tracker, the share of Americans who say they are \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d concerned that they or someone they know will get sick stayed mostly steady at about 68 percent.\n\nAnd the share of Americans who say they\u2019re concerned about the virus\u2019s impact on the economy has also stayed about the same \u2014 hovering at around 87 percent \u2014 for the past six weeks.\n\nThe share of Americans who approve of Trump\u2019s handling of the virus response, however, has declined about 4 points over the past month, though in the shorter term his rating remains essentially unchanged, with 43.3 percent approving of the job he\u2019s doing handling the pandemic this week and 43.5 percent approving last week.\n\nAttitudes toward Trump\u2019s handling of the crisis are, expectedly, very partisan, with a majority of Republicans approving and a majority of Democrats opposed. Feelings seem to be more mixed about leaders outside the federal government, however \u2014 according to a new Pew Research poll, state and local officials, on average, continue to enjoy more bipartisan support than Trump. However, Republicans appear to be souring on local and state officials\u2019 work faster than Democrats are. For instance, since March, the share of Republicans who think their local elected officeholders are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job has declined by 12 points, while the share of Democrats who say the same has remained unchanged at 66 percent. Likewise, Republican approval of the job state officials were doing declined by 12 percentage points, while Democratic approval dropped by only 5 points. Additionally, Republicans, who were more likely than Democrats to rate public health officials such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention favorably in March were less likely to do so now. Sixty-eight percent of Republicans said health officials are doing a \u201cgood\u201d or \u201cexcellent\u201d job, down 16 points since March, while about three-quarters of Democrats felt health officials were doing a good job in both polls.\n\nHowever, at this point, the majority of Americans are not yet frequenting public places \u2014 despite growing disagreement on where the coronavirus crisis is headed next. A Morning Consult poll conducted last week asked Americans about whether they\u2019re going to public places and socializing with others, and it didn\u2019t find much of a partisan gap in reported behavior. So for now at least, it seems like many Americans are staying put, although that might change in the coming weeks.\n\nOther polling bites\n\nAccording to a Morning Consult/Politico poll , 71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later).\n\n71 percent of voters \u2014 including 58 percent of Republicans and 82 percent of Democrats \u2014 said that the president and vice president ought to wear face masks in public places when they travel. Trump recently failed to wear a mask during a tour of a mask production facility in Phoenix, and Vice President Mike Pence didn\u2019t wear one when visiting a coronavirus testing site at the Mayo Clinic last month, although he later said he should have (he did wear one when visiting a ventilator factory in Indiana a few days later). A YouGov/CBS News poll found that Americans were evenly split on whether they thought the new coronavirus was \u201csomething from nature\u201d or \u201ccreated by people, on purpose,\u201d with about two-thirds of Republicans saying it was manufactured and over two-thirds of Democrats saying it occurred naturally. Scientists have not found evidence that the virus was created.\n\nHalf of Americans said they would be \u201csomewhat\u201d or \u201cvery\u201d likely to use a cell phone-based contact-tracing system to determine if they had come into contact with someone who was diagnosed with the coronavirus if the system were established by the CDC and public health officials. But the other half of respondents said they wouldn\u2019t use such a system, according to an Ipsos/Axios poll. And if the effort were spearheaded by cell phone or internet providers, major tech companies, or the federal government, only about a third of Americans said they\u2019d be likely to use it.\n\nAn SSRS/CNN poll conducted last week found former Vice President Joe Biden with a 5-point lead over Trump nationally, but in 15 battleground states, Trump led Biden 52 percent to 45 percent. The poll did not break out voter preference by battleground state, however; it sampled people in 15 battleground states and reported the results in aggregate. That makes it hard to know in which states Trump may have an advantage.\n\nAccording to polling from the Levada Center, an independent pollster in Moscow, Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s approval ratings have fallen to 59 percent, the lowest they have been in more than six years.\n\nTrump approval\n\nAccording to FiveThirtyEight\u2019s presidential approval tracker, 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job Trump is doing as president, while 52.0 percent disapprove (a net approval rating of -8.4 points). At this time last week, 43.3 percent approved and 51.4 percent disapproved (for a net approval rating of -8.1 points). One month ago, Trump had an approval rating of 44.3 percent and a disapproval rating of 51.4 percent, for a net approval rating of -7.1 points.\n\nGeneric ballot\n\nIn our average of polls of the generic congressional ballot, Democrats currently lead by 7.7 percentage points (48.9 percent to 41.2 percent). A week ago, Democrats led Republicans by 7.9 points (48.5 percent to 40.6 percent). At this time last month, voters preferred Democrats by 7.8 points (48.6 percent to 40.8 percent).\n\nCheck out all the polls we\u2019ve been collecting ahead of the 2020 elections.\n\nCORRECTION (May 15, 2020, 10:01 a.m.): A previous version of this article reversed President Trump\u2019s job approval numbers: 43.6 percent of Americans approve of the job he\u2019s doing and 52.0 percent disapprove, not the other way around.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: Does The U.S. Have A Coronavirus Recovery Plan?", "author": ["Dhrumil Mehta"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/infectious-disease-experts-think-washington-states-slow-reopening-will-mean-fewer-cases/", "published": "2020-05-14T11:00:20", "title": "Infectious-Disease Experts Think Washington State\u2019s Slow Reopening Will Mean Fewer Cases", "text": "On Wednesday, the total number of COVID-19 cases stood at 1,382,304, with deaths at 78,343. The U.S. is continuing its phased reopening, but states are rolling back restrictions at different rates \u2014 and their residents are out and about to widely varying degrees.\n\nTo investigate the consequences of different approaches, we return to a survey of infectious disease experts organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians from the University of Massachusetts Amherst. For many questions, respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nIn this week\u2019s survey, conducted May 11 and 12, most experts predicted that the total number of positive cases in the U.S. would be more than 1.45 million on May 17. The experts also estimated some measures of the disease in Pennsylvania and Washington, two states with different reopening plans.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported on May 17?\n\nIn recent weeks, the researchers have been given distinct ranges of total confirmed COVID-19 cases and asked to assign a probability to each bin. Last week, the experts nailed their forecast: The expert consensus was that on May 10 there would be between 1.3 million and 1.45 million confirmed positive cases reported by The COVID Tracking Project. The actual number reported on May 10 was 1,322,807.\n\nThis week\u2019s expert consensus puts the most probable range at somewhere between 1.45 and 1.55 million total confirmed cases on May 17. But the expert consensus also assigned a 10 percent probability to a more pessimistic scenario \u2014 one in which there are more than 1.6 million cases.\n\nHow many deaths in Pennsylvania on June 13?\n\nWith the president attempting to pressure Pennsylvania Gov. Tom Wolf into reopening his state more quickly, there is increasing tension between the governor\u2019s three-phase plan and some counties\u2019 desires to open up faster. There have been 58,698 total cases of COVID-19 in Pennsylvania, and the current death toll stands at 3,943. The experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths in the state on June 13. The consensus projection was 7,239 dead, with an 80 percent chance that the actual number will fall between 5,249 and 10,472.\n\nOne expert even believes that the death count could plausibly reach 30,000 in the Keystone State, though that view is not shared by the rest of the panel.\n\nHow many new daily cases in Washington?\n\nEven as it extended its stay-at-home orders through the end of the month, Washington state has begun a four-phase reopening plan that Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s administration is calling \u201cSafe Start.\u201d The state plans to remain in each phase for a minimum of three weeks. The first phase of Safe Start allows for some recreation and construction activity, along with auto sales and commercial pet walking. At the time of the survey, five counties with fewer than 75,000 residents and no new reported cases in the past three weeks were allowed to begin Phase 2, which allows the resumption of activity in restaurants, house cleaning services and hair and nail salons, among other businesses.\n\nThe experts were asked to forecast the average new cases per day in Washington for the first week of June. Their consensus estimate of 332 is in line with case counts near the peak of the outbreak in late March and early April, with an 80 percent chance that the actual daily average will fall between 158 and 644 cases.\n\nExperts were also asked to estimate the average daily case count in the first week of June if all Washington counties were allowed to enter Phase 2 on May 16. They forecast an average of 554 new daily cases under such a plan \u2014 an increase of 67 percent over their estimate of cases under the current plan.\n\nWhat\u2019s interesting about this prediction is that 554 average new daily cases is more than the 441 new cases on March 23, which is thus far the highest number of new cases reported in a single day. Since the experts were asked to predict the average number of new daily cases over the course of a week, they appear quite pessimistic about the effects of an early rollout of Washington\u2019s Phase 2 plan.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/without-a-vaccine-herd-immunity-wont-save-us/", "published": "2020-05-13T10:58:39", "title": "Without A Vaccine, Herd Immunity Won\u2019t Save Us", "text": "Daniel Arlein has already had COVID-19. In March, the 36-year-old small business owner and DJ, who lives in Brooklyn, tested positive for the viral infection and suffered through two weeks of flu-like symptoms.\n\nArlein has since recovered, and while he\u2019s still being careful \u2014 avoiding leaving the house, washing his hands more often and wearing a face mask \u2014 he can\u2019t help feeling a bit relieved to have already had the infection.\n\n\u201cThe only way it\u2019s helping me is psychologically, to be able to go out in the world and still be careful but not be freaked out that I\u2019m going to get sick,\u201d he said. \u201cI have no idea if I will get sick again. I feel like I won\u2019t, but I have no idea if I can get it again.\u201d\n\nMost people understand immunity to mean that once a person has been exposed to a disease, they can\u2019t get it again. It\u2019s an easy concept to grasp, and some people have hoped that widespread immunity could be the way out of this pandemic: If enough of the population becomes immune to the disease, the spread would be stopped, since the virus would run out of new, susceptible targets. The \u201cherd\u201d of immune people would protect everyone.\n\nBut getting to herd immunity without a vaccine isn\u2019t as simple as the idea itself. A number of variables can affect when herd immunity is reached \u2014 and what it costs to get there \u2014 and they vary depending on the disease. How infectious is the disease? How deadly is it? And how long do people stay immune once they\u2019ve gotten it? Adjusting any of these variables can drastically change the outcome of this equation. You can probably sense where this is heading \u2026\n\nWe\u2019ve built a very simplified version of how those variables interact. (You\u2019ll see just how simple in the methodology beneath the simulator.) To be clear, this is not about COVID-19 itself \u2014 instead, our calculator shows how a theoretical disease we\u2019re calling Fictionitis would play out in a population that has never encountered it before and does nothing to try to stop it.\n\nYou\u2019ll notice that each variable plays a role in setting a herd immunity threshold and reaching it.\n\nThe more people a person with Fictionitis infects on average, the higher the herd immunity threshold rises, but the faster spread also means that the threshold is reached more quickly. That, of course, can lead to a huge portion of the population getting ill at once, which would overwhelm hospitals. Unless the death rate is extremely low, that would be a devastating mix. A disease that doesn\u2019t spread as readily will stick around for longer, but it helps maintain a flatter curve.\n\nIf you shortened the immunity duration, you may have also seen that the blue bar showing how much of the population is susceptible rose again even after the herd immunity threshold had been crossed. That\u2019s because if immunity fades while the disease is still active, people who were previously immune once again become at risk for infection. Herd immunity only truly works while the recovered population has immunity to the disease.\n\nFor COVID-19, of course, we can\u2019t change these variables, and we still haven\u2019t nailed down their exact values, anyway. What we do know so far paints a stark picture: This disease is too deadly, too contagious and too new to depend on post-infection immunity (as opposed to immunity via vaccination) as a solution. Naturally acquired herd immunity is not the answer.\n\nWhat is herd immunity?\n\nIf everyone in a population is immune to the infection, it can\u2019t spread. But we can prevent a disease\u2019s spread even without everyone being immune. If enough people are immune, the infection is unlikely to spread to big swaths of vulnerable people because those who are immune, the \u201cherd,\u201d protect them. The more people who are immune, the more likely it is that infectious people will only come into contact with people who cannot be infected, ending the spread. This creates a societal barrier between the infectious and the vulnerable.\n\nThe moment when herd immunity kicks in depends on how contagious the pathogen is, which is measured by what experts call the basic reproduction number, or R0 (pronounced \u201cR naught\u201d). The R0 is simply the average number of people an infectious person will spread the disease to in a population where no one is immune, so an R0 of 3 would mean an infected person spreads the disease to, on average, three other people while they\u2019re contagious.\n\nSubscribe to our coronavirus podcast, PODCAST-19\n\nThe higher the R0, the higher the proportion of the population that needs to be immune to stop its spread. This is known as the herd immunity threshold, and the formula for finding it is actually pretty straightforward: 1 \u2013 1/R0. For a really contagious disease like measles, which has an R0 between 12 and 18, 93 to 95 percent of the population needs to be immune to stop the spread (this is why the U.S. has had recent measles outbreaks when vaccination rates dropped even slightly).\n\n\u201cThe higher the proportion in a population that is infected, the fewer places there are for that virus to go, the fewer people are susceptible to being transmitted,\u201d said Greta Bauer, an epidemiologist and biostatistician at Western University in Ontario, Canada. \u201cThat makes sense, right? If one person, on average, infects two other people but half the population is immune, they\u2019re only going to be able to infect one other person.\u201d\n\nFor COVID-19, we\u2019re still not certain what the R0 is, so we don\u2019t yet know what the herd immunity threshold is. For now, it\u2019s estimated to be anywhere from 70 to 90 percent. But here\u2019s the problem: To reach even the lower end of that range naturally in the U.S. \u2014 imagine giving up on any interventions and just letting the disease run its course \u2014 230 million Americans would eventually become infected and, depending on the fatality rate (more on that later), millions could die.\n\nAnd reaching herd immunity as the outbreak is raging is a completely different scenario than, for example, doing so after a vaccine has been created. With a vaccine, you can immunize people before they\u2019ve encountered the virus, so by the time the virus gets to a vaccinated population, it has nowhere to spread. But in an active outbreak, even once the herd immunity threshold is reached, the infection keeps going. It takes time for the spread of the disease to crest because, for a while at least, many contagious people will each still infect a small number of vulnerable people, which means even more people will get sick and die. It\u2019s a phenomenon known as \u201covershoot.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe disease sort of stops increasing at the point when you reach herd immunity, but there\u2019s still lots and lots of people infected. It only slowly goes down, and on its way down, [it] infects another third of the population,\u201d said Richard Neher, an evolutionary biologist at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \u201cIf you drive a car and suddenly you switch off the engine, it doesn\u2019t stop instantly.\u201d\n\nSo think of crossing the herd immunity threshold as determining the fate of the disease (it\u2019s now bound to die out) rather than its status (it\u2019s dead).\n\nSince the new coronavirus is highly contagious (meaning a large percentage of the population would have to get it to slow its spread), the human toll of reaching herd immunity without a vaccine would be staggering. And that\u2019s assuming that once a person gets sick, they stay immune for a long time. But at this point, we don\u2019t know if that\u2019s the case.\n\nHow long are we immune once we\u2019ve had it?\n\nTo reach that herd immunity threshold we either need a vaccine, or we need a lot of people like Arlein who have had the virus and are now immune. Except we don\u2019t actually know if Arlein, or anyone else, is really immune.\n\nTypically, when we encounter a new pathogen, our immune system mounts a defense that includes producing antibodies to fight off the infection. Afterward, some of those antibodies and immune cells hang around, allowing our body to \u201cremember\u201d the offending microbe and more easily fend it off in the future.\n\nMore men than women are dying from COVID-19. Is it biology or behavior? l FiveThirtyEight\n\n\u201cThe vast majority of anything that you or I have been infected with in our lives, our immune system has developed immunity to and remembers,\u201d said Shane Crotty, an immunologist at the La Jolla Institute for Immunology in California. \u201cThere are definitely exceptions, but that\u2019s the norm.\u201d\n\nThose exceptions are why experts, including the World Health Organization, can\u2019t presume that having had COVID-19 means you can\u2019t get it again, even though antibodies have been detected in recovered patients.\n\n\u201cThe presence of antibodies, everybody thinks that means immunity, but I study HIV and there\u2019s a huge antibody response to HIV, and it\u2019s never able to neutralize that virus,\u201d Bauer said.\n\nResearchers have begun trying to find out how much protection COVID-19 antibodies give people who\u2019ve recovered from the disease. There\u2019s a chance that the immune response from COVID-19 is enough to prevent someone from getting sick again, but not necessarily from getting infected, which means they could still be contagious to others, according to Crotty.\n\nIt\u2019s likely COVID-19 confers at least some immunity, though. For one, there are no confirmed cases of someone getting COVID-19 twice. Early reports from South Korea drew a lot of attention after patients tested positive for the virus again weeks after having recovered, but researchers later said that dead virus fragments from the original infection likely triggered the positive tests, rather than a second infection. One early study from China \u2014 which has not yet been peer reviewed, so take it with an extra grain of salt \u2014 also measured neutralizing antibodies in 94 percent of patients.\n\nPrevious research done on similar coronaviruses, like the ones that cause SARS and MERS, also offers some promising signs. In a mouse study testing a SARS vaccine, for example, researchers stimulated an immune response that staved off a dose of the virus.\n\nBut why would we fail to become immune to a disease? There are a few things that could be happening. Our bodies could stop short of completely killing off the virus in the first place, allowing it to lie dormant and reemerge later (that\u2019s the case with HIV). The virus could evolve enough that our old antibodies won\u2019t work anymore, whether we got them from natural exposure or a vaccine (this is what the seasonal flu does, and it\u2019s part of why we need a new vaccine every year). Or the immune response we produce could just fade too quickly, making us susceptible to reinfection almost immediately.\n\nWith the new coronavirus, there\u2019s not much evidence that either of the first two scenarios is in play, but the third possibility \u2014 that our immunity fades quickly \u2014 remains an open question, and one we won\u2019t be able to answer until more time has passed. Coronaviruses also cause common colds, after all, and humans seem perpetually susceptible to those. In one oft-cited study, for example, people were given a dose of a cold-causing coronavirus, got sick and recovered, then were given another dose a year later. Most of the patients got reinfected, showing how quickly their immunity waned. (And most of them didn\u2019t get sick, which opens up a whole new barrel of fun: If COVID-19 works the same way, some people who had the disease and recovered could wind up picking up \u2014 and spreading \u2014 the novel coronavirus again despite not being symptomatic.)\n\n\u201cOne reason is because your immune system just doesn\u2019t remember all things equally, and to some extent that memory is tied to how severe the initial infection was,\u201d Crotty said.\n\nThat said, for SARS and MERS, both of which were also caused by coronaviruses, immune memory cells were detected in patients several years after infection, though because those outbreaks have ended, we don\u2019t know if those immune cells would protect against reinfection.\n\nThe only way to know if COVID-19 immunity lasts for, say, 10 years is to wait until a decade has passed and see if anyone who was infected once ever got reinfected. (We\u2019re just full of good news, aren\u2019t we?)\n\nWho\u2019s had it?\n\nEven if it turns out that infected people become immune for some period of time, we still aren\u2019t close to herd immunity solving our COVID-19 problem for us. So few people have had the disease that we\u2019re nowhere near herd immunity yet, and the fatality rate is so high that closing that gap would be devastating.\n\nEventually, reliable serological tests, which detect antibodies, can be administered to large samples of the population. That will give us a better sense of how many people actually had the infection, and thus the disease\u2019s true fatality rate. There was some hope that these serological surveys would reveal the disease was much more widespread \u2014 and therefore way less deadly \u2014 than we thought. If, for example, you have 50 deaths in a community and 1,000 recorded cases, the fatality rate is 5 percent (50 out of 1,000). But if a serological survey of that community later revealed that there were actually 3,000 cases, that fatality rate drops to 1.7 percent.\n\nUnfortunately, early serological surveys suggest the fatality rate isn\u2019t low enough to offer us much comfort.\n\nIn the U.S., there have been 81,507 deaths as of May 12. For a fatality rate of 0.1 percent, the same as the seasonal flu, we\u2019d have to find out that 81.5 million Americans, or nearly a quarter of the U.S. population, had already had COVID-19. But based on early serological surveys, the World Health Organization says it\u2019s likely that only about 2 to 3 percent of the population has been exposed so far.\n\nSome serological surveys have reported wildly different estimates of how many people may be immune. A recent survey in California, for example, found that something like 2 to 4 percent of the population had antibodies, while studies in Germany and Massachusetts found antibodies in 15 to 30 percent of those tested.\n\nOne reason for these huge variations could be that rates are genuinely higher in hotspots. Indeed, in New York, the hardest-hit city on the planet, as much as 21 percent of the population may have already been exposed, according to preliminary results from a serological survey. But if even in New York, less than a quarter of the population has antibodies, it\u2019s pretty unlikely that levels are nearly that high in the rest of the country. And New York has also seen a huge number of deaths: at least more than 19,563 as of May 12. Even if this early estimate is correct and 21 percent of New York\u2019s 8.4 million residents have already been infected, that comes out to 1.8 million people, which still puts the current fatality rate at 1.1 percent, or more than 10 times that of the seasonal flu.\n\n\u201cLooking at what percentage of the population might actually have been infected, the numbers of the cases are much higher and the case fatality rate looks like it might be around half a percent,\u201d said Jeremy Rossman, a virologist at the University of Kent. \u201cPeople say, \u2018Oh that\u2019s a trivial number, it\u2019s minuscule.\u2019 But, when you think about, say, the population of the United States, 0.5 percent is a tremendous number, and these are people\u2019s lives.\u201d\n\nThe other potential explanation for why those serology survey results are all over the map is there may be problems with the way they were conducted. None of the papers mentioned above have been published in peer-reviewed journals yet, and many experts have raised concerns about false positives and how people were recruited for studies, suggesting even these low levels might be overestimating the true prevalence of the disease.\n\nSo let\u2019s go back to that 70 percent herd immunity threshold. If the fatality rate is around 0.5 percent and 70 percent of Americans have to get sick before their immunity starts protecting others, that means more than 1.1 million people would die. In New York, even having 21 percent of the population exposed, if that serological survey is accurate, has overrun hospitals and led to the death of one in every 400 New Yorkers, while the vast majority of the population remains susceptible.\n\n\u201cThat\u2019s the cost of getting to 20 percent,\u201d said Emma Hodcroft, a postdoctoral epidemiology researcher at the University of Basel in Switzerland. \u201cIt really illustrates the price you\u2019re going to pay if you want to get up to the 60 percent or 70 percent that you\u2019ll need for herd immunity, and I hope it really illustrates why that just isn\u2019t a feasible plan.\u201d", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers", "Julia Wolfe", "Laura Bronner"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/more-men-than-women-are-dying-from-covid-19-is-it-biology-or-behavior/", "published": "2020-05-11T21:51:51", "title": "More Men Than Women Are Dying From COVID-19.

Blue states, such as Washington and New York, were initially hit hardest by the COVID-19 crisis, and stay-at-home orders went into effect as early as March 19 (California was first out of the gate). A number of red states have refrained from implementing such public-safety orders, and many Republican-leaning states, particularly in the South, didn\u2019t issue orders for weeks afterward \u2014 as late as April 3 in Florida and Georgia. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis waffled over closing the state but eventually did so under pressure from state lawmakers.\n\nBut, at least on the front end of this crisis, Americans weren\u2019t deciding what to do based on politics. Americans living in red states appear to have taken the crisis plenty seriously; data shows that residents there were staying home well before their governors issued stay-at-home orders.\n\nCuebiq, a private data company, assessed the movement of people via GPS-enabled mobile devices across the U.S. If you look at movement data in a cross-section of states President Trump won in the southeast in 2016 \u2014 Tennessee, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, South Carolina and Kentucky \u2014 23 percent of people were staying home on average during the first week of March. That proportion jumped to 47 percent a month later across these six states.\n\nIf defying social distancing orders were really a political statement, you\u2019d think that the southeast would be a hotbed for dissent. Yet people in the six states we examined changed their behavior around mid-March, before the states\u2019 official stay-at-home orders. In fact, about 90 percent of the total change between early March and mid-April had occurred in the week before the stay-at-home orders were passed in each state.\n\nThat\u2019s more or less in line with the country at large, as you can see in the chart below.\n\nAlmost uniformly across these states, people started staying home beginning on March 14. The percentage of people staying home rose rapidly over the following nine days and tended to plateau by March 23.\n\nThe Cuebiq data suggests that behavioral changes were largely driven by people making a voluntary choice to stay home rather than being forced to do so by a state-sanctioned stay-at-home order. One need only look at the behavior of residents in North Carolina and their neighbors in South Carolina: While North Carolina issued a stay-at-home order eight days before South Carolina, a stabilized number of people in both states started staying at home about a week before North Carolina\u2019s order.\n\nWhy did people begin to stay at home so early? In mid-March, the seriousness of the virus had begun to permeate the national and international conversation. On March 9, the Dow dropped to its lowest point since the 2008 financial crisis. Earlier that same day, Italy announced a nationwide lockdown. On March 11, the NBA announced that it would suspend its season indefinitely, a sign to many Americans that the pandemic would indeed change all facets of life, and on March 12, the World Health Organization declared COVID-19 a pandemic. Some of the earliest official actions in the U.S. occurred around that time in the state of Washington, when Gov. Jay Inslee announced on March 11 a ban in three counties on gatherings of more than 250 people and public schools in Seattle also announced they would close. Many other U.S. cities closed schools, restaurants and bars in rapid succession around March 16.\n\nThis sort of mass behavioral change in such a short time is significant. It took over 50 years and hundreds of billions of dollars in prevention efforts to lower the percentage of people who smoke in the U.S. from 42 percent in 1965 to 13 percent in 2018. Americans reacted to the threat of COVID-19 in a relative blink of an eye.\n\nThe question that now looms, of course, is whether Americans\u2019 individual behavioral changes will last as the pandemic wears on and the summer sun beckons. We\u2019ll be watching movement data to get a sense of how quickly we will return to normal \u2014 or at least how quickly we establish a new normal.\n\nWhy does COVID-19 make some people sicker than others? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Clare Malone", "Kyle Bourassa"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-its-not-too-late-for-contact-tracing/", "published": "2020-05-08T15:30:41", "title": "Why It\u2019s Not Too Late For Contact Tracing", "text": "As the U.S. starts to reopen amid the COVID-19 pandemic, experts say we\u2019ll need to track everyone who has come in contact with a COVID-19 patient to stop new chains of infection.

The total count of positive cases now stands at more than 1.2 million, according to numbers from The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nIn our effort to make sense of the range of possible outcomes for the outbreak, we\u2019ve continued to follow the results of a weekly survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the United States. In this week\u2019s survey, conducted May 4 and 5, experts predict that the total number of positive cases in the U.S. will be more than 1.3 million and less than 1.45 million on May 10. The experts also forecast a total of 255,500 deaths attributed to the coronavirus by the end of 2020.\n\nThe survey is organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst. Respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 10?\n\nLast week, the consensus from the experts was that there would be between 1 million and 1.15 million confirmed U.S. cases by May 3. The reported number of 1,152,006 fell just outside that range, according to The COVID Tracking Project. This week, the researchers were asked to predict the number of confirmed cases by May 10. The expert consensus put the most probable range between 1.3 million and 1.45 million cases. (Like last week, the researchers were given five distinct ranges of total confirmed cases and asked to assign a probability to each bin.)\n\nHow many U.S. jurisdictions will report more new cases in September than in June?\n\nIn a new question, the experts were asked to forecast out to September and predict how many states and territories (plus the District of Columbia) would report more new COVID-19 cases in that month than they did in June. Questions like this require two separate predictions, with one largely conditional on the other. This increases the difficulty and uncertainty of the forecasts.\n\nAccordingly, the distribution of answers given by the experts is more uniform across the range of possible outcomes. But in the mass of uncertainty, there is perhaps some good news: As summer stretches into fall, experts assigned the highest probability to fewer than four states reporting more new coronavirus cases than they had in June.\n\nWhat will happen in Texas?\n\nOn May 1, Texas Gov. Greg Abbott allowed his stay-at-home order to expire. In the most recent seven-day period for which the state is reporting data \u2014 April 30 through May 6 \u2014 the average daily new case count is 1,053. The panel of experts were asked to forecast the average number of new daily cases in Texas during the week ending on June 13.\n\nThe experts predict that the new seven-day daily average in Texas is most likely to rise to between 1,350 and 1,800, affirming the widely held belief that social distancing measures have been effective at containing the spread of the disease. Experts placed a slightly smaller probability on the chances of Texas seeing between 900 and 1,350 new daily cases, on average.\n\nMeanwhile, most experts believe that the average new daily case count would have fallen under the stricter stay-at-home guidelines that Texas previously had in place. The experts forecast a 31 percent probability that the average number of new cases would have been between 675 and 900 had the stay-at-home order not been allowed to expire.\n\nHow many deaths will there be by year\u2019s end?\n\nFinally, the experts were asked to forecast the total number of deaths attributable to COVID-19 by the end of 2020. The consensus estimate is that 255,500 die, with a 90 percent chance of the death total falling between 118,750 and 1,211,500 \u2014 a large range.\n\nThe low end of the expert\u2019s range may be optimistic, however. The FiveThirtyEight model roundup shows that most models project 100,000 or more deaths by the end of May. Modeling the virus continues to be incredibly challenging, so it\u2019s difficult to know which set of expectations to weight more heavily. But with uncertainty still high and spring in the air, perhaps some optimism in this moment is warranted \u2014 or at least forgivable.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Josh Hermsmeyer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/why-scientists-think-the-novel-coronavirus-developed-naturally-not-in-a-chinese-lab/", "published": "2020-05-04T19:58:42", "title": "Why Scientists Think The Novel Coronavirus Developed Naturally \u2014 Not In A Chinese Lab", "text": "You could be forgiven for wondering how a disease as fast-moving and deadly as COVID-19 could just appear naturally, out of nowhere, seemingly overnight. President Trump expressed doubt, saying that \u201ca lot of people\u201d were looking at the possibility that a Chinese lab was responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic. Earlier that week, Fox News ran a story in which unnamed sources suggested that the COVID-19 outbreak originated in a Wuhan laboratory \u2014 the Wuhan Institute of Virology, which studies coronaviruses with a number of international collaborators. The New York Times reported that spy agencies are being pressured to find evidence blaming the lab, and at the end of April, the National Institutes of Health withdrew funding from a research consortium that had collaborated with the lab. As recently as this weekend, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, despite saying there was no reason to disbelieve the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that the virus was neither manmade nor genetically modified, claimed there was \u201cenormous evidence\u201d connecting the virus to the WIV.\n\nBut the truth is almost certainly not that salacious. Robert Garry, a professor of microbiology and immunology at the Tulane University School of Medicine, said this dynamic is familiar. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s an outbreak, people say, oh, there\u2019s a lab close by.\u201d He should know: In 2014, during the Ebola epidemic in West Africa, conspiracy theorists alleged his team\u2019s lab in Sierra Leone, not far from the origin of the outbreak, was a George Soros-funded bioweapons site.\n\nAccording to a growing body of research, SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is almost certainly a naturally occurring virus that initially circulated in bats then spilled into humans. But that hasn\u2019t stopped some from trying to find a more sinister origin. \u201cIt seems like such an extreme event that people are looking for an extraordinary explanation for it,\u201d said Stephen Goldstein, a postdoctoral researcher at the University of Utah who studies coronaviruses. No single piece of evidence has yet confirmed the virus\u2019 origin. But according to scientists, the evidence that does exist paints a consistent picture of a wild virus, not one that sprang from a lab.\n\nWhy do scientists think it wasn\u2019t genetically engineered?\n\nTo genetically engineer a new virus, scientists can combine pieces of viruses they\u2019ve seen before. In the case of a genetically engineered coronavirus that was designed to infect humans, the bulk of its genetic material \u2014 its \u201cbackbone\u201d \u2014 would come from SARS or a close relative, while the tools it used to infect cells would be grafted on. But the backbone doesn\u2019t look like any disease-causing virus, and other key parts of the virus are new to science.\n\nIn SARS-CoV-2\u2019s case, scientists thought they knew how to optimize SARS to infect human hosts. Coronaviruses enter host cells using protein \u201cspikes\u201d that cover their outer surface. At the tip of each spike is a cluster of amino acids that can bind to a certain receptor on a host cell, like a pick designed to open a particular cellular lock. In the case of SARS-CoV-2, the spike binds to human ACE2 receptors, which coat lung cells.\n\nThe original SARS coronavirus targeted the same receptors, and after the 2002 SARS epidemic, experiments tinkered with its spike to determine the structure of an \u201coptimized\u201d version of the SARS lock pick. Many factors influence the success of a virus, but its binding ability is thought to be important, so \u201cif you were going to make a new virus, and make it even more infectious than SARS,\u201d said Goldstein, you would give it that optimized tip.\n\nBut, Garry said, the tip of the SARS-CoV-2 spike is unlike anything scientists have seen before, sharing only a single key amino acid with SARS. Modeling suggests that it shouldn\u2019t be able to bind to human lungs well, but the new configuration is about as effective as the optimized SARS.\n\nHow SARS-CoV-2 acquired this unusual tip is still a mystery. But blaming it on genetic engineering overstates the abilities of scientists, Garry said. Guessing that these particular amino acids can bind to ACE2 so effectively is nearly impossible\u2014 there are 20 common types of amino acids, and tens of millions of ways to arrange them into a binding tip. It would be like if you looked out over the proverbial infinite monkeys with their infinite typewriters, guessed that a specific macaque would type out King Lear, and then picked the right animal.\n\n\u201cNobody has that kind of insight into how the viruses evolve or cause disease,\u201d said Garry. \u201cYou could randomly try to make changes, but we\u2019re talking about thousands of years of trying pathogens out. I\u2019ve been really lucky to know a lot of talented virologists, and they\u2019re not clever enough to come up with a virus that\u2019s quite this good at spreading.\u201d\n\nWhat if it was in a petri dish and got out?\n\nAnother theory suggests a researcher at the WIV studying a precursor to SARS-CoV-2 was accidentally infected.\n\nBut the researchers I spoke to threw cold water on that. \u201cI think it\u2019s not unreasonable to ask these questions and examine all sources of the outbreak,\u201d said Gregory Koblentz, a professor at George Mason University who studies biosecurity. \u201cBut based on what we know of the biology of the virus, a natural source of the outbreak is the most likely explanation.\u201d\n\nThe virus\u2019s spike has a hinge-like structure, allowing the spike to change shape as the virus enters the host cell. Like the spike tip, the hinge on SARS-CoV-2 is markedly different from anything seen in its close relatives. New research suggests that the hinge loses its unique characteristics when cultured in a lab, said Garry. The spike also appears to be able to shield itself from antibodies\u2014another hint that it evolved in the presence of host immune systems.\n\nMost importantly, there\u2019s no smoking gun connecting the lab to an ancestor of the virus. There\u2019s \u201cno bat virus that\u2019s close enough to be the progenitor,\u201d said Garry. The closest known relative to SARS-CoV-2 is a cousin that diverged decades ago in bats.\n\nAnd while critics suggest that the WIV might have concealed the ancestral virus, 27 scientists who have collaborated with the WIV, including former U.S. officials, rejected the idea in a letter to The Lancet.\n\nKoblentz agrees there\u2019s not much evidence to suggest a cover-up. \u201cIf the Chinese government suspected that the outbreak was the result of a biosafety breach in Wuhan, I would have expected them to come down very hard on that lab, not letting them talk to foreigners,\u201d he said. But in March, a lead researcher at the WIV talked to Scientific American about her search for the ancestral strain.\n\nThe WIV has released sequences of bat coronavirus in the months since the epidemic started, giving other scientists insight into the origins of the virus that causes COVID-19. Several of the early virus genome sequences in an open-source international database were submitted by the WIV, which allowed other countries to begin developing diagnostic tools. That willingness to release data, Koblentz said, could be evidence that weights \u201cthe scale towards [the WIV] being transparent and cooperative.\u201d\n\nThen how\u2019d it get here at all?\n\nThere\u2019s a simpler, if less flashy, explanation for the emergence of a new SARS. A study, published in 2018, of four rural villages in Yunnan province located near caves containing bats known to carry coronaviruses found that 2.7 percent of those surveyed had antibodies for close relatives of SARS. Thousands, if not millions, of people are exposed to wild coronaviruses every year. Most of them aren\u2019t dangerous, but \u201cif you roll the dice enough times,\u201d Goldstein said, you\u2019ll see a bad one.\n\nCritics have raised concerns over biosafety protocols at the WIV, but Angela Rasmussen, a virologist at Columbia University, said the criticisms are based on evidence taken out of context. The reports of biosafety issues, she said, are \u201clike having the health inspector come to your restaurant. It could just be, \u2018Oh, you need to keep your chemical showers better stocked.\u2019 It doesn\u2019t suggest, however, that there are tremendous problems.\u201d\n\nAnd Garry reiterated that it\u2019s incredibly unlikely SARS-CoV-2 is the result of a \u201cbad\u201d roll of the dice at the WIV. \u201cAll the natural exposures dwarf the possibility that it was some lab guy that was out catching bats and infected himself. That\u2019s one little thing among millions of encounters.\u201d\n\nIt\u2019s impossible to totally rule out a lab accident, Rasmussen said, but she worries that unilateral, politically charged investigations will permanently damage international scientific collaboration.\n\n\u201cWe live in a global world,\u201d said Rasmussen. \u201cIt would hurt us tremendously if we were to stop collaborating with Chinese scientists.\u201d The next pandemic is unlikely to come from a lab, just as Ebola, SARS, Zika and avian flu did not, she said. And the U.S. will be much more vulnerable if our epidemiologists face it alone.", "author": ["Philip Kiefer"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-crises-and-domestic-violence-and-what-that-could-mean-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-04T11:00:10", "title": "What We Know About Crises And Domestic Violence \u2014 And What That Could Mean For COVID-19", "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, in addition to its direct impact on people\u2019s health, has unleashed a perfect storm of conditions that may increase the rate of domestic violence. Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

On Tuesday, the number of Americans who have tested positive for COVID-19 passed 1 million, and on Wednesday, deaths attributed to the disease \u2014 which are probably underestimated \u2014 rose to more than 60,000.\n\nAs the numbers of confirmed cases and deaths continue to grow, we checked back in with a survey of infectious-disease researchers from institutions around the U.S. to help us understand where we might be headed.\n\nFor the week ending April 25, 13,788 deaths were attributed to the coronavirus. In this week\u2019s survey, which was conducted on April 27 and 28, a plurality of experts predicted that weekly death totals would not fall below 5,000 until after June 20. The experts also forecast that between 1 million and 1.15 million total confirmed cases of COVID-19 will be reported on May 3.\n\nFor some questions in the survey \u2014 organized by Thomas McAndrew and Nicholas Reich, both biostatisticians at the University of Massachusetts Amherst \u2014 respondents are asked to provide their best estimate, as well as a best-case and worst-case possibility. Structuring the survey in this way lets the organizers generate probabilistic consensus forecasts, a tool that can answer questions about how likely various scenarios are.\n\nHere\u2019s what the experts had to say this week.\n\nHow many confirmed cases will be reported by May 3?\n\nThe experts have been asked this question in the past, and actual case numbers have fallen within their forecasted ranges. This time, they were given a set of five bins of predefined total confirmed cases and were asked to assign a probability to each. For the week ending May 3, the expert consensus is that between 1.1 and 1.15 million total confirmed cases will be reported by The COVID Tracking Project.\n\nAs has been true throughout the crisis, however, there is still a lot of uncertainty surrounding the predicted confirmed case count. The consensus forecast says that the chance (about 18 percent) that confirmed cases will be between 1.05 and 1.1 million is the same as the chance it will be above 1.2 million.\n\nWhen will new reported deaths per week drop below 5,000?\n\nIn the past two weeks, deaths attributed to the coronavirus have hovered above 13,700 (13,708 and 13,788). A drop to 5,000 weekly deaths would represent a decline of 64 percent \u2014 a substantial decrease. But experts are pessimistic that such a drop will happen in the near future. The expert consensus gives a nearly 40 percent chance of the U.S. hitting the 5,000-death weekly plateau by June 6 and a probability of just over 60 percent of it occurring some time after then.\n\nWhat will happen in Georgia?\n\nOn April 23, Georgia partially reopened for business, and stay-at-home restrictions have continued to be lifted across the state. The seven-day moving average for newly confirmed cases in the Peach State stood at just over 700 per day on April 20. Experts were asked to predict the new daily case average for the week ending on May 16 under the current open regime, along with the daily case average had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home orders.\n\nThe consensus forecast of 1,044 new confirmed cases per day in two weeks suggests that Georgia will see a substantial worsening of the virus\u2019s spread as a result of reopening. The daily number of new confirmed cases is forecast to be somewhere between 579 and 2,292, with six experts indicating that an increase to 2,000 or more new cases a day is plausible.\n\nExperts believe that the spread of COVID-19 could have been reduced had Georgia not relaxed its stay-at-home order. Under this scenario, experts predicted that Georgia would have seen only 487 new cases per day for the week ending on May 16, a reduction of more than 50 percent in new daily cases compared with the estimates in the open regime.\n\nThere was also less uncertainty among experts in their predictions for Georgia\u2019s new daily cases in the world where Georgia did not relax stay-at-home orders. Experts would have expected between 273 and 1,156 new cases per day, representing a spread half as large as the one for the new-case forecast without the stay-at-home orders.\n\nAs Americans slowly prepare to go back to work, the experts\u2019 forecast helps quantify the increased risk Georgia and other states have incurred by beginning to restart their economies in the midst of a still-uncontrolled pandemic.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen.

But experts don\u2019t know what\u2019s causing the gap. Is it biological, some quirk of cells and hormones? Is it the result of gendered behaviors that have more to do with sociology than sex chromosomes? Let\u2019s break down what\u2019s going on, because experts say men\u2019s risk level depends on what risks (and which men) you\u2019re talking about.\n\nWhat we know\n\nWhile men account for the majority of COVID-19 cases in some countries but a minority of cases in others, they consistently make up the majority of deaths. Out of 35 countries that have reported their COVID deaths in ways that break out victims by sex, 33 had a male-female death ratio greater than 1, meaning men who were confirmed to have the disease were more likely to die than women who were confirmed to have it, according to data compiled by Global Health 50/50, an independent health equity research organization based at University College London. \u201cSo far, the mortality disadvantage for men is quite large,\u201d said Jennifer Dowd, a professor of demography and population health at the University of Oxford.\n\nMen are more likely than women to die of COVID-19 Share of COVID-19 patients who died, by gender Deaths among confirmed cases Country male female ratio Dominican Republic 6.5% 2.1% 3.0 Thailand 2.5 0.9 2.7 Greece 7.8 3.1 2.5 Romania 7.9 3.5 2.3 The Netherlands 18.1 8.1 2.2 Italy 17.1 9.3 1.8 Belgium 15.3 8.6 1.8 Northern Ireland 10.4 5.6 1.8 Spain 10.2 5.8 1.8 Ecuador 6.9 3.9 1.8 Denmark 6.6 3.6 1.8 Argentina 6.3 3.5 1.8 Philippines 8.2 4.9 1.7 China 4.7 2.8 1.7 Sweden 15.1 9.4 1.6 Mexico 10.9 6.9 1.6 Switzerland 6.1 3.7 1.6 Ukraine 3.2 2.0 1.6 South Korea 2.9 1.8 1.6 Indonesia 9.3 6.4 1.5 Republic of Ireland 5.8 3.7 1.5 Colombia 5.4 3.5 1.5 Peru 3.1 2.1 1.5 South Africa 1.7 1.1 1.5 Australia 1.5 1.0 1.5 Portugal 4.7 3.3 1.4 Germany 4.5 3.2 1.4 Canada 4.5 3.6 1.3 Austria 4.1 3.1 1.3 Norway 2.9 2.3 1.3 Finland 3.3 2.8 1.2 Luxembourg 2.6 2.1 1.2 Iran 5.9 5.4 1.1 India 2.6 3.1 0.9 Pakistan 2.0 2.8 0.7 Numbers in this table come from different dates, depending on the country and how frequently it updates its publicly available data. Most of the data is dated to April 26-29, though a few countries\u2019 numbers are from earlier in April. China\u2019s data is from Feb. 28 and Iran\u2019s is from March 17. Source: Global Health 50/50\n\nThis dynamic isn\u2019t new to medicine. \u201cWomen have stronger adaptive immune responses and die less of infectious disease their entire lives, starting from infant mortality,\u201d Dowd said. In general, women\u2019s bodies kick out bacterial and viral invaders faster than men\u2019s do, and vaccines work better for women than for men.\n\nTo see why, look to hormones and genetics, said Sabra Klein, professor of microbiology and immunology at Johns Hopkins University. Sex hormones appear to play a role determining how well human bodies can fight off disease. In general, estrogens amp up the immune system, while androgens (like testosterone) and progesterone suppress it. Hormones have to interact with cells to do their jobs, Klein said, so cells have a \u201clock\u201d and hormones have the \u201ckey\u201d to get in. And, turns out, every immune cell in your body has these kinds of lock-and-key receptors.\n\nSex chromosomes also play a role. The X chromosome, for example, has 60 genes associated with immune function. Most biological males are born with one X chromosome, but those immune-boosting genes tend to be expressed more frequently in women, who generally have two X chromosomes, Klein said.\n\nBut if you\u2019re tempted to think those sex differences boil down to \u201cmen are more likely to die from infectious disease,\u201d Klein cautioned that the generalization is not true across the board. Sex differentiation in influenza has been pretty well studied, she told me, and, in that case, women\u2019s more aggressive immune systems don\u2019t give us an advantage. Having too much of an inflammatory immune response to the flu can actually increase your risk of complications \u2014 including acute respiratory distress syndrome, when the lungs\u2019 tiny air sacs, called alveoli, are damaged and fill with fluid. \u201cReproductive-age women do worse, not better,\u201d Klein said.\n\nWhat we know we don\u2019t know\n\nBut while researchers know a decent amount about sex differences in influenza, the novel coronavirus is, yes, novel. Any research on it is a work in progress, proceeding without full data. That starts with basic documentation.\n\nOn April 28, the United States had reported 57,318 deaths from the novel coronavirus, but only 31,586 of those deaths had been reported in ways that allowed Global Health 50/50 to break them down by sex. None of the researchers I spoke with knew why that data isn\u2019t getting reported. But without it, they\u2019re left to a lot of guesswork and speculation. It\u2019s safe to assume that deaths in the U.S. are probably following the patterns seen in many other countries \u2014 but we don\u2019t know for sure that that\u2019s true.\n\nThen there\u2019s the fact that the variations in how this virus affects people probably isn\u2019t just about what\u2019s in their chromosomes or hormones. It\u2019s also about sociological gender \u2014 the attitudes, stereotypes and norms that shape the ways people behave and the choices they make.\n\nFor example, a 2016 meta-analysis showed that women are about 50 percent more likely than men to start using non-pharmaceutical protective behaviors during a pandemic \u2014 things like wearing face masks or avoiding public transit. Men, meanwhile, were about 12 percent more likely than women to sign up for vaccines, take antiviral medication, or use other pharmaceutical interventions. Those differences in behavior aren\u2019t determined by biology, but they could help create variations in how a virus affects men and women.\n\nRosemary Morgan, a scientist at Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health who studies how gender and sex interact with public health, thinks these kinds of effects are happening with COVID-19. But how and to what extent \u2014 that\u2019s unknown. It also probably differs from country to country, thanks to the way gender norms also aren\u2019t consistent everywhere you go.\n\nCase in point: When data on sex disparities in COVID-19 deaths first began to come in from China, it wasn\u2019t clear that the differences in death rates there would mean other counties were going to experience the same thing. That\u2019s because China has particularly gendered smoking habits, Dowd told me. In a 2010 study, 54 percent of Chinese men surveyed were current smokers. In contrast, the same study found that less than 3 percent of Chinese women currently smoked. Although sex differences in COVID-19 death rates have cropped up again in other countries, it\u2019s likely that this gender disparity in smoking plays a role in why 64 percent of China\u2019s COVID-19 deaths have been among men even though men account for right around half of China\u2019s confirmed cases.\n\nGender norms may also influence the niches where women are getting the disease more than men, despite men\u2019s higher death rates. When the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention looked at the characteristics of health care workers who have contracted COVID-19, it found that 73 percent were women. Why are female health care workers getting infected at much higher rates? Part of it likely has to do with their higher odds of exposure.\n\nNurses\u2019 jobs put them in close physical contact with patients who have COVID-19 and other infectious diseases, and more than 70 percent of nurses are women. Meanwhile, the personal protective equipment meant to help keep medical workers safe often isn\u2019t designed with women in mind. Gloves can be too large. Masks don\u2019t always fit women\u2019s faces with a tight seal. Gender dynamics could be putting a largely female workforce in harm\u2019s way.\n\nIn the end, regardless of your sex \u2014 or your gender \u2014 the risks you face from COVID-19 are probably somewhat unique to you. But if we want to figure out just what, exactly, those risks are, we\u2019re going to need more data.\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/do-you-buy-that-the-united-states-has-gotten-over-the-coronavirus-hump/", "published": "2020-04-27T16:49:26", "title": "Do You Buy That \u2026 The United States Has Gotten Over The Coronavirus Hump?", "text": "Do You Buy That \u2026 The United States Has Gotten Over The Coronavirus Hump?", "author": ["Nate Silver"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/videos/should-we-sacrifice-our-data-privacy-to-fight-the-coronavirus/", "published": "2020-04-24T18:36:13", "title": "Should We Sacrifice Our Data Privacy To Fight The Coronavirus?", "text": "Should We Sacrifice Our Data Privacy To Fight The Coronavirus?\n\nSenior writer Neil Paine looks into how personal data is being used to fight COVID-19 and explores when such measures become too invasive.\n\nRead more from Neil Paine.", "author": ["Neil Paine", "Tony Chow"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/one-chart-isnt-going-to-tell-you-when-the-pandemic-peaked/", "published": "2020-04-23T21:19:02", "title": "One Chart Isn\u2019t Going To Tell You When The Pandemic Peaked", "text": "These days it seems like you can\u2019t even scroll through goat videos on Twitter without hitting a COVID-19 chart \u2014 and people trying to use the chart to understand whether the epidemic has \u201cpeaked.\u201d\n\nSome good news: This graph shows diagnosed cases statewide over the last couple of weeks.

That curve sure seems like it\u2019s bending! Or, that new case number seems lower than yesterday\u2019s!\n\nBut it\u2019s not that easy. Each chart you see reflects a host of decisions \u2014 which data to chart, which source to use, how to compare countries or states, how to display the data \u2014 that can drastically change what you see and what you can safely take away from the chart. To truly understand whether a place has reached the peak of its infection curve, you need to be a savvy reader of the charts and the underlying data. And, ideally, you need to look at more than one chart.\n\nSo what should you keep in mind when you\u2019re trying to interpret all these data visualizations?\n\nWhat is the chart showing?\n\nBefore you can know whether the chart is showing you a peak, you need to know what data it\u2019s showing you in the first place. Are you looking at total confirmed cases? Total hospitalizations? Total deaths? Or is the chart showing you day-by-day counts? Each of these numbers provide information \u2014 but each is incomplete. And they\u2019re not interchangeable.\n\nConfirmed cases\n\nIt\u2019s really hard to tell whether someplace has hit a peak using a chart of confirmed cases. Obviously, we\u2019d like to see the number of people who have tested positive for the coronavirus decline. But anytime you see something tracking the number of cases, remember how hugely dependent it is on the number of tests being done. Anyplace that doesn\u2019t test for the coronavirus is not going to find cases. That\u2019s especially true in the U.S., where the number of tests done is reportedly minuscule relative to how many people report symptoms.\n\n\u201cWhen we see a plateau, it may just be because we\u2019ve maxed out our testing capacity rather than a true flattening of incident cases,\u201d said Tara C. Smith, a professor of epidemiology at Kent State University. In other words, a flatter curve might just mean that the number of tests is failing to keep up with the number of infections. And as some states look to resume certain economic activities, they may have an incentive to keep testing levels low so the number of cases doesn\u2019t appear to increase.\n\nSo let\u2019s change our understanding of these kinds of charts off the bat: These aren\u2019t visualizations of the number of cases, they\u2019re visualizations of the number of confirmed cases, a number that, in most countries, drastically underestimates the true number of people who are sick.\n\nEven if testing was sufficient, the tests themselves still need to be accurate. There are reports that some tests might have shockingly high rates of false negatives \u2014 that is, people who have the disease but get a negative test result at least some of the time.\n\nEven if all cases were somehow measured, there would still be a lag between when someone is infected and when they get tested. It takes time to develop symptoms (the incubation period), have those symptoms get bad enough to send someone to the doctor for a test, and for the test to come back. While the lag likely differs by person, the numbers on a chart of confirmed cases are (even in the best case) quite out of date.\n\nThis lag is also one reason why charts showing the daily number of new cases can be somewhat misleading. What looks like a change happening that day might actually be reflecting a change that started a week or two ago. And lots of funky things can happen as data is collected and reported that can artificially depress or inflate a day\u2019s tally.\n\nAll of that could be dealt with \u2014 if all those factors stayed constant. That is, if people were generally getting tested at the same point in the course of their illness \u2026 and how health care professionals administered the tests wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 and the tests themselves weren\u2019t changing \u2026 and the delay in reporting results wasn\u2019t changing \u2026 then the trends in confirmed cases would still be informative about the virus\u2019s spread, even though the number of confirmed cases wouldn\u2019t directly reflect the number of infections. We\u2019re just looking for a change in the trend line on the chart, after all.\n\nBut the problem is that we don\u2019t know if any of that is staying constant. So it\u2019s very difficult to glean a useful signal from a metric as noisy as confirmed case counts.\n\nDeaths\n\nSo counting cases is fraught. What about just counting deaths? Surely that\u2019s less questionable, since every place already tracks how many people die there, so those numbers should be more reliable. This might be true \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to be sure.\n\nTo track coronavirus deaths, you still need to confirm that a person who died had COVID-19 \u2014 and it\u2019s unclear that that\u2019s being done. Some people aren\u2019t being tested before or after they die, and COVID-19 may not appear on someone\u2019s death certificate even if it seemed likely they had the disease. For people who don\u2019t die at a hospital, establishing the cause of death might be even more challenging, especially if coronavirus tests are scarce and being reserved for the living. And some countries have changed how they count deaths outside of hospitals as this pandemic has ground on, making it harder to interpret the trend over time.\n\nHospitals and governments also have an incentive to underreport COVID-19 deaths, since fatalities can make those institutions look bad. For instance, the CIA doesn\u2019t believe the Chinese government\u2019s official infection and death tallies.\n\nHospitalizations\n\nAre hospitalizations the most accurate type of data? New York City, for example, has started releasing the number of people who have been hospitalized. Assuming that this data is collected correctly, we might think that this is the chart that would provide us the most reliable trend. If it peaked, then that would seem to be a good indicator that the infection has as well, even if most people with COVID-19 are never hospitalized.\n\nBut what happens if the criteria for hospitalization change as the outbreak progresses? If hospitals increase the threshold for admission as they run out of beds \u2014 if, for example, any shortness of breath was enough to get someone admitted in the early days of the pandemic, but health care workers start turning away those patients as resources get scarcer \u2014 then a chart that shows a plateau in hospitalizations could be a sign of a system approaching capacity rather than (or in addition to!) a change in the number of infections. (The same is true, for instance, if people are increasingly told to avoid hospitals unless absolutely necessary.)\n\nHow is the data being displayed?\n\nThe kind of chart you\u2019re looking at also matters. Peaks are even harder to see if charts use a logarithmic scale, which many COVID-19 visualizations do. Using a log scale means that the chart\u2019s vertical axis doesn\u2019t increase the way you might expect, with the distance between 0 and 1,000 being the same size as the distance between 10,000 and 11,000. Instead, the number multiplies for each equally sized space on the y-axis \u2014 that is, if one space on the y-axis goes from 100 to 1,000, the next space of the same size will go from 1,000 to 10,000, and the one after that will go from 10,000 and 100,000, but the size of the gap between each set of those numbers stays the same even as the numbers jump up by bigger and bigger margins. This kind of trick has several advantages, including that it lets you compare a location\u2019s curve when it has a relatively low number of cases and when it has a high number of cases. (If you have a linear scale, in contrast, showing the top end of the scale necessarily means that small values will be very hard to see.)\n\nOn the other hand, using a log scale also means that once you get to higher values, small-looking fluctuations in case counts can reflect pretty big differences in raw numbers. This makes it even harder to visually draw inferences about peaks from charts.\n\nOf course, all of these concerns are even more serious when the chart shows data from more than one place, regardless of whether what\u2019s being compared are different countries or different states. These kinds of charts have all the same issues as the ones tracking numbers in a single place, but that set of problems is multiplied by the number of places on the chart.\n\nWhat happens next?\n\nLet\u2019s say that, according to one of the metrics above, the curve does seem to be bending downward. What does that mean? Well, first, you might want to look at the other metrics too. If all three measures \u2014 confirmed cases, hospitalizations and deaths \u2014 are going down, and the total number of tests administered hasn\u2019t dropped, that makes it more likely that there really is good news. And a better metric \u2014 though still one with issues \u2014 is the share of positive tests out of all tests administered, which tries to account for testing in some way (though it doesn\u2019t address whether who is being tested is changing). (Though if the number of cases is still growing, even if it\u2019s at a lower rate, that would continue to increase the strain on an already burdened health care system.)\n\nAnd as Joshua Epstein, the director of the New York University Agent-Based Modeling Lab, said in an online seminar: With any infectious disease, \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of transmission after the peak.\u201d Reaching the peak on a chart doesn\u2019t mean you can go outside again \u2014 it means that the outbreak is at its worst. Even if it is getting better, you might still need to be extremely careful for a while.\n\nAnd even if you are fully convinced that things are truly improving \u2014 new cases are going down, hospitals are nowhere near overcrowding, and the sick are getting better \u2014 what do you do when restrictions ease? Germany, which tested very high rates of people early on in the outbreak and had relatively low case numbers and deaths, has come up with a plan for gradual reopening. But if the peak has been successfully averted and relatively few people have had the disease, that might mean that a second, potentially larger peak is in the offing. Even after the infection peaks, the danger may be on the rise.\n\nCORRECTION (April 23, 2020, 5:41 p.m.): An earlier version of this story misstated how the y-axis on a logarithmic chart would look.

Some, though, have a severe, even deadly, case. Why is it that someone who seems healthy and has no underlying conditions could be killed by this virus when so many of their peers pull through just fine? Let\u2019s break down what we know and what research is needed to answer this COVID-19 mystery.\n\nWhat we know\n\nOur understanding of why some people get mild infections while others wind up hospitalized or killed by COVID-19 is still limited. In the U.S., 34 percent of confirmed COVID-19 cases are in patients under the age of 45, according to Centers for Disease Control and Prevention data from mid-March. Of patients known to be hospitalized, about 20 percent were under 45, and of those known to be admitted to the ICU, 12 percent were under 45. The CDC also reports that the case fatality rate is less than 1 percent for people age 20-54.\n\nBut there isn\u2019t much we know about why some young people are getting extremely sick and others aren\u2019t. We know that age is a risk factor \u2014 the case fatality rate for COVID-19 climbs steeply for patients over 60. This is true for a lot of infections and generally has to do with diminishing immune systems and underlying health conditions.\n\nBut that doesn\u2019t help us figure out what\u2019s going on with these cases where young people get sick and it quickly turns serious. It\u2019s not as simple as pointing to underlying conditions. Many conditions, such as asthma, haven\u2019t been definitively confirmed as risk factors, though many doctors suspect they are.\n\n\u201cWe have guesses, but we don\u2019t know,\u201d said Dr. David Smith, the head of the Division of Infectious Diseases and Global Public Health at the University of California San Diego. \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some time to figure that out.\u201d\n\nWhat we don\u2019t know (and how we figure it out)\n\nSure, there\u2019s plenty scientists don\u2019t know, but that\u2019s what hypotheses are for. Researchers have already begun studies to uncover which factors contribute to a severe or deadly case.\n\nSome are looking into genetic differences. Our genes can affect the way our immune system responds to an infection, which could explain why some people fare worse than others. \u201cThe possibilities, unfortunately, are endless,\u201d said Dr. Jean-Laurent Casanova, an investigator at the Howard Hughes Medical Institute and physician at Rockefeller University Hospital. \u201cBetween the first encounter with the virus and death, you can imagine that there are lots and lots of steps. At any of these steps, a defective immunity in any of the cells encountered by the virus can be responsible for severe disease and therefore death.\u201d\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nCasanova is leading a global study to try to identify what, if any, genetic mutations may cause otherwise healthy young people to have a more severe or deadly infection. The study will look for any shared genetic mutations among otherwise healthy patients under 50 who tested positive for COVID-19 and were admitted to an ICU. From there, they can investigate those mutations further to determine whether they cause a susceptibility to severe COVID-19.\n\nAnother factor being investigated is the infectious dose, or the amount of virus a patient was exposed to when they first became ill. Could it affect how sick someone becomes, regardless of their age or health? This can be determined through epidemiological studies, where researchers compare groups of patients to learn more about how they first became infected and whether higher levels of viral exposure correspond to sicker patients. For example, Smith explained that researchers could track households where at least one member got COVID-19 and measure how much virus the patient is shedding, then observe how other members of the household fare. It can also be studied using animals in a lab to see how immune responses change at different levels of exposure.\n\nThere\u2019s also a chance that whether or not you have already been exposed to COVID-19 can determine how severe your infection is. With the dengue virus, for example, the first time someone is exposed to the virus, they often have only a mild infection, but if they encounter it a second time, it can become deadly. Researchers believe this is due to the antibodies the body creates after first exposure, which start to diminish over time. If they drop to a low enough level, they\u2019re not able to fight off the virus, but instead they inadvertently assist the virus in infecting cells. It\u2019s called antibody-dependent enhancement, and researchers are investigating whether past exposure to this or a similar coronavirus could worsen the symptoms of COVID-19.\n\nOther researchers are looking at whether the microbiome \u2014 the menagerie of bacteria, viruses and fungi that live in and on the human body \u2014 could be playing a role. Microbiomes differ from person to person and some microbes have been known to help or hinder an individual\u2019s ability to fight off infection.\n\nAll of these possibilities will require studies that use control groups to determine whether these variables are actually causing a more severe reaction or if their presence is just a coincidence. It might be true that a high proportion of COVID-19 patients drink coffee, for example, but that doesn\u2019t necessarily mean drinking coffee puts you at a higher risk of COVID-19. (And, god, can you imagine if it did?) The only way to know for sure is by running a trial and comparing a group with one set of factors to a group without those factors to see if there\u2019s a consistent difference between them.\n\nIn the midst of an ongoing crisis, one way to ethically do this (without purposely giving people a potentially deadly infection) is through a case control study, which looks retroactively at infections that have already played out.\n\n\u201cSo you have a case and a control and they look the same, except one progressed and one didn\u2019t,\u201d Smith, of UCSD, said. \u201cThen you sort of work your way backwards and say, \u2018What is really different between these two groups?\u2019 And you need lots of people [in the study] to get that figured out.\u201d\n\nAnother option is called a cohort study, where a sample of the population is enrolled and then followed over time to see who gets sick and how sick they get. Those who got seriously ill can then be compared to those who didn\u2019t get sick or had less severe infections to see what differences stand out.\n\nLuckily, many of the studies needed to determine why some young people get severe infections are already underway, and we could see preliminary results in a matter of months. But it may take years to fully understand why COVID-19 affects people differently.", "author": ["Kaleigh Rogers"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/how-one-high-risk-community-in-rural-south-carolina-is-bracing-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-04-22T18:58:59", "title": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19", "text": "How One High-Risk Community In Rural South Carolina Is Bracing For COVID-19 Hardeeville has one of the country\u2019s highest ratios of vulnerable residents to ICU beds.\n\nJust as some demographic groups are more at risk than others of getting seriously ill from the new coronavirus, some parts of the country are more vulnerable to being hit hard by this pandemic. In places with more sick people, more people over 65 and fewer hospital beds per person, the health care system could easily be swamped, leaving residents who need hospitalization in even greater danger.\n\nTo find the areas at the greatest risk of being overwhelmed by a COVID-19 outbreak, we analyzed the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention\u2019s Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System, a collection of surveys that ask U.S. residents about their health, which allowed us to estimate what percentage of residents in a region were at risk due to their age or underlying health conditions. We then used Kaiser Health News\u2019s data on the number of hospitals and intensive care unit beds in each U.S. county to find the ratio of at-risk residents to beds.\n\nBy that measure, one of the most vulnerable regions for which we have data is the Hilton Head Island metropolitan area, where about 63 percent of adults are at high risk of becoming seriously ill from COVID-19 and there are approximately 3,900 high-risk individuals for every ICU bed.\n\nWhile the percentage of Hilton Head residents who are at risk is on the higher end of our data set, it\u2019s still notably lower than the 70 to 80 percent we saw in several other areas we analyzed. But those regions had more health care facilities to serve those at-risk residents, while the Hilton Head area has only three hospitals and 28 ICU beds.\n\nHow a shortage of sand could delay coronavirus vaccine l FiveThirtyEight\n\nTake Hardeeville, for example. It\u2019s a small city in the Hilton Head metropolitan area, and in many ways it\u2019s like any other rural area. Under normal circumstances, the city\u2019s residents would be looking forward to an Easter egg hunt, golf and pickleball tournaments, proms and graduations. But the people of Hardeeville are particularly vulnerable to the new coronavirus. In the last decade, the city has seen a population boom, and many of those new residents are retirees, according to Hardeeville Mayor Harry Williams. The city\u2019s large older population \u2014 the percentage of residents who\u2019ve hit retirement age is nearly twice as high as the national share of people over 65 \u2014 may be cause for concern, as Jasper County, where Hardeeville is located, has only one hospital and four ICU beds.\n\nWhile regular hospital beds can be converted to serve critically ill patients, it\u2019s not easy to do because ICU beds require more equipment and specialized room layouts. Despite the difficulties, Coastal Carolina Hospital, the only hospital in Jasper County, has added beds for seriously ill patients by turning its observation unit into an ICU patient treatment area, according to hospital CEO Joel Taylor. Other hospitals are adding beds in temporary spaces like tents and trailers.\n\nBut it\u2019s not just a lack of beds that can strain the health care system, noted David Wallace, a critical care doctor and professor at the University of Pittsburgh. Shortages of space, staff, medications and other vital resources are also a concern, and health systems in rural and poorer areas will be stretched the thinnest.\n\n\u201cThere are going to be parts of the country that don\u2019t even have the staffing even if you were able to ramp up your available resources, in terms of places to put these patients,\u201d Wallace said. \u201cIf we were able to create more ICU beds and more ventilators and more [personal protective equipment], who\u2019s going to be staffing those areas?\u201d\n\nCoastal Carolina Hospital is cataloguing what skills workers already have and cross-training them to work in parts of the hospital outside their normal assignments. This gives the hospital more flexibility in staffing, allowing it to do more with a limited number of employees by switching people to cover areas facing staffing shortfalls.\n\nHardeeville\u2019s mayor is also worried about how easy it would be for the area to run out of other types of vital workers, like first responders. \u201cBeing in a rural area, we have a good staff, but it\u2019s not a staff that can afford to have a whole shift wiped out because one person got sick and passed it onto the entire shift,\u201d Williams said. \u201cThat\u2019s a big concern of ours because we don\u2019t have replacement numbers if our first responders get sick.\u201d\n\nWilliams said the city got a shipment of additional masks and other protective gear for its first responders a few weeks ago, just as supplies were running low. So far, the city hasn\u2019t run out, but it also doesn\u2019t have a stockpile that would last through a big surge of cases.\n\nAs of Tuesday, there have only been 15 COVID-19 cases and one death in Jasper County, according to South Carolina\u2019s Department of Health and Environmental Control. COVID-19 data should always be taken with a grain of salt, though, since tests have been so hard to come by. The closest testing site to Hardeeville is a hospital in a neighboring county, about 35 minutes away. Coastal Carolina is working on being able to test patients on site, Taylor said.\n\nThe state is encouraging residents to practice social distancing. But of course, staying at home is easier for some people than others. Williams said that in the gated communities where older residents often live, \u201cAmazon is a way of life,\u201d but that\u2019s not the case for working families.\n\n\u201cDelivery services are not as effective as, let\u2019s say, New York City,\u201d Williams said. \u201cFor the working families that have to go to the grocery stores, go to Walmart for their everyday needs, those people need to go out. Those stores are open and they are taking precautions. The governor has limited the amount of people allowed in them, based on their square footage.\u201d\n\nBut even those who have to go out are doing their best to keep infection rates down, Williams said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s pitching in.\u201d\n\nBut more people may start leaving their homes soon. Shutting down businesses is having devastating effects on the economy, and the Hilton Head area is a popular vacation destination, so losing that influx of tourism dollars is an especially big blow for places like Hardeeville. South Carolina\u2019s governor announced Monday to allow public beaches and some retail stores to reopen.

Last week\u2019s jobs report for the month of April estimated the national unemployment rate at 14.7 percent, and Thursday\u2019s report implies that perhaps another 2.5 percent of the labor force has filed for benefits since the beginning of May.\n\nIt\u2019s a grim situation, though not every area has been hit equally hard. So which parts of the economy have seen the most damage? Using data from the most recent jobs report, I dug into changes in total nonfarm employment by sector from February \u2014 the last full month before the coronavirus-triggered economic crisis truly began \u2014 to April, starting at the \u201dsupersector\u201d level, or the most broadly grouped parts of the economy:\n\nWhich major industries are hit hardest by unemployment?

But it\u2019s clear that the leisure and hospitality industry was hurt far more than any other. In February, nearly 17 million Americans worked in that supersector, which comprises the arts, entertainment and recreation sector \u2014 including spectator sports and gambling \u2014 and the accommodations and food services sector. By April, that number had fallen by nearly 50 percent, to just 8.7 million.\n\nThe leisure and hospitality fields suffered heavy job losses Percent change in seasonally adjusted leisure and hospitality employees from February to April 2020, by supersector, sector and subsector Employees (millions) Industry Feb.

As such, leisure and hospitality businesses were always going to struggle under the pandemic\u2019s terrible constraints. Every subsector of this industry has lost at least 25 percent of its employees since February, and most have lost 40 percent or more. Among all the sectors and subsectors tracked by the Bureau of Labor Statistics for the month of April, only one \u2014 scenic and sightseeing transportation, which falls under the umbrella of trade, transportation and utilities \u2014 saw more job losses than amusements, gambling and recreation, which shed 60 percent of its employees in a two-month period.\n\nAlthough it wasn\u2019t hit as hard as leisure and hospitality, the \u201cother services\u201d supersector also saw a 22 percent reduction in positions from February to April. That area has three subsectors:\n\nServices are struggling (especially hairdressing and laundry) Percent change in seasonally adjusted \u201cother service\u201d supersector employees from February to April 2020, by supersector and subsector Employees (millions) Industry Feb.

The struggles of hairstylists and cosmetologists during this crisis are well-documented, as these professions made up more than half the jobs in this supersector in 2019. And although laundry workers have been deemed essential in some states, many have seen business volume drop significantly \u2014 not only because customers have been avoiding unnecessary trips outside but also because homebound teleworkers aren\u2019t dressing as nicely as they otherwise would. As a result, the number of employees working in that slice of the economy has fallen by 54 percent since February.\n\nFor most other supersectors, jobs have dropped by somewhere between 8 and 13 percent since before the coronavirus crisis started, meaning almost every corner of the economy has been touched by the pandemic. The only areas experiencing more modest (though still significant) losses were in government \u2014 with workers at the federal level faring better than their state or local counterparts \u2014 and financial activities:\n\nFinancial and government jobs are weathering the storm Percent change in seasonally adjusted financial activities and government supersector employees from February to April 2020, by supersector, sector and subsector Employees (millions) Industry Feb.

But even among the supersectors weathering things best, certain areas have seen plenty of job losses: The real estate market is teetering on the edge of a rent crisis, as unemployed tenants struggle to make payments, and rental/leasing jobs are down more than 20 percent from a few months ago. Both state and local government education are also down more than the overall government average over the past few months.\n\nBut those areas are still doing better than some others. If we dig deeper into the subsectors of the economy, the differences between those with the heaviest and lightest job-loss numbers are striking:\n\nWhich subsectors lost jobs \u2014 and which are surviving?

But no matter the size of the industry, only a few areas managed to resist a net decline in employees, compared with their pre-coronavirus norms.\n\nWith even more people filing unemployment claims every day that the coronavirus lockdowns continue, these numbers are likely to get even worse. By definition, recessions always exact a terrible toll on the job market. But this one is unusual in just how many people are out of work \u2014 and how wide-ranging the unemployment has already been.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/many-americans-are-getting-more-money-from-unemployment-than-they-were-from-their-jobs/", "published": "2020-05-15T11:00:49", "title": "Many Americans Are Getting More Money From Unemployment Than They Were From Their Jobs", "text": "The United States is not known for its generosity to the unemployed. But the coronavirus crisis has transformed our system for compensating jobless workers. As tens of millions of workers suddenly became unemployed, Congress passed an expansive relief package with an unprecedented $600-per-week supplement for jobless workers. The goal was to replace their wages so they could survive the economic lockdown.\n\nAs a result, though, many people may now be eligible for substantially more money while unemployed than they made while they were working. A new analysis by Peter Ganong, Pascal Noel and Joseph Vavra, economists at the University of Chicago, uses government data from 2019 to estimate that 68 percent of unemployed workers who can receive benefits are eligible for payments that are greater than their lost earnings. They also found that the estimated median replacement rate \u2014 the share of a worker\u2019s original weekly salary that is being replaced by unemployment benefits \u2014 is 134 percent, or more than one-third above their original wage. A substantial minority of those workers, particularly in low-wage professions like food service and janitorial work, may end up receiving more than 150 percent of their previous weekly salary.\n\nThe research underscores one of the central \u2014 and most politically explosive \u2014 tensions of our economic crisis: What\u2019s the best way for our battered unemployment insurance system to keep jobless workers afloat during a historic downturn with no end in sight?\n\nThe idea behind a $600 payment was simple: In 2019, the national average unemployment payment was $370 per week and the national average salary for unemployment recipients was $970 per week. The additional $600 per week is meant to make up the difference, providing enough money on a weekly basis to fully replace the average unemployment recipient\u2019s salary. Other analyses of estimated average wages and unemployment benefits have already shown, though, that replacement rates likely vary quite a bit by state.\n\nBut looking at average wages doesn\u2019t tell the whole story, because the country\u2019s significant income inequality means that more workers fall into lower-wage categories. To address that problem, the new analysis simulates benefits for the median \u2014 rather than the mean \u2014 unemployment-eligible worker, drawing on Census Bureau labor supply data.\n\nThis data comes with a few important caveats. One is that because government data lags, the sample of workers the researchers drew on for the analysis does not reflect the much larger pool of people who are unemployed right now. If anything, Ganong told me, that means the researchers\u2019 estimates may understate how many unemployed workers will be eligible to receive more than their original salary during the current crisis, since the effects of the economic shutdown have disproportionately hit lower-income workers. Plus, the fact that workers are eligible for unemployment insurance doesn\u2019t mean they have the benefits yet. Delays in applying for and receiving unemployment payments have been widely reported across the country, and some workers are still struggling to get through their state\u2019s system.\n\nThe analysis illustrates how something that seems like a simple proposition \u2014 replacing jobless workers\u2019 salaries while a public health threat persists \u2014 is not something our unemployment insurance system was built to do quickly or easily. Most of the experts I spoke with agreed that back in March, when the unemployment insurance expansion passed, a flat payment was the most feasible solution. Unemployment benefits are always inconsistent across states, though, since each state sets its own rates. And now, those inequalities are even more pronounced. The median unemployment-eligible worker in Massachusetts is eligible for an estimated 125 percent of her former salary, compared to 166 percent in Mississippi.\n\nThe researchers uncovered other kinds of inequality, too. In some professions, like janitorial work, people who are employed by essential businesses are continuing to show up to their jobs under hazardous conditions. But in doing so, they may be eligible for less money than janitors who have been laid off or furloughed by a nonessential business. In an ideal world, Ganong said, the people who have kept working at hospitals or grocery stores would be receiving some kind of hazard pay. \u201cBut that\u2019s generally not the reality, which means there\u2019s a weakness in the current system,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re giving more money to certain workers to stay home than to other workers who are putting themselves at risk by going to work.\u201d\n\nSeveral economists and unemployment insurance experts reviewed a draft of the analysis at FiveThirtyEight\u2019s request. Many were surprised by the number of workers estimated to be eligible for unemployment benefits that exceeded their original wages. \u201cI think we all knew that some workers were going to be getting more than their original earnings,\u201d said Michael Strain, the director of economic policy studies at the right-leaning American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI would not have guessed that it was quite this many workers, but I certainly think that it\u2019s a completely plausible figure.\u201d\n\nThe question is whether this will be a problem as the economy starts to reopen. In addition to the inequality inherent in possibly replacing some workers\u2019 wages at a higher rate, it might not make financial sense for workers to search for other jobs or even return to their original jobs if they\u2019re making substantially more money by staying home. Some experts don\u2019t see that as a bad thing \u2014 in fact, to some, providing an extra incentive to stay home during a pandemic might be a feature, not a bug. \u201cMy bigger worry is that workers will feel pressured to go back to an unsafe job,\u201d said Michele Evermore, a senior policy analyst at the left-leaning National Employment Law Project. But it could also make it more difficult for businesses to convince their workers to return \u2014 at least, at the salaries they were being paid before.\n\nA fight is already brewing on Capitol Hill about whether the $600-per-week payment should be continued after it expires at the end of July. House Democrats have argued that it\u2019s working well, and proposed a straightforward renewal of the existing payment as part of a bigger relief package. Republicans, meanwhile, are pushing for a cap on benefits or a bonus for workers who return to work. Another option, Ganong and his coauthors point out, is for the federal government to provide workers with a percentage of their lost wages that, combined with state unemployment insurance payments, would come close to replacing their original salary.\n\nBut that would require a more complex calculation by state unemployment insurance agencies \u2014 one they might be unwilling or unable to implement. \u201cIn a perfect world, I would prefer to give people a percentage of their income,\u201dsaid Heidi Shierholz, a senior economist at the left-leaning Economic Policy Institute. \u201cBut we might not be set up to do it.\u201d Many state unemployment insurance agencies are still using decades-old computer systems, for example, presenting potential technical challenges if Congress asked them to change the benefits formula. And Daniel Zeitlin, the director of policy at Washington state\u2019s unemployment office, said that while he didn\u2019t think it was impossible, any change would be difficult for a system already under tremendous stress.\n\nAnother route is to simply reduce the fixed bonus payment when the $600-per-week benefit expires, or \u2014 as some Democratic politicians have proposed \u2014 phase out the benefit as social distancing requirements are eased and the unemployment rate starts to go down. Ramping down to a payment as small as $100 or $200 each week would still be generous by historical standards, according to Gabriel Chodorow-Reich, an economist at Harvard University. And it would continue to provide some kind of buffer for workers who have trouble finding jobs.\n\nSimply reducing the payment could end up exaggerating the lopsidedness rather than fixing it, though. According to the University of Chicago team\u2019s analysis, halving the payment to $300 per week would still mean that 42 percent of unemployed workers would be getting more than their original wages \u2014 and some people would be receiving a smaller fraction of their previous salary. A $300 weekly payment would leave one-quarter of unemployed workers with replacement rates below 60 percent. \u201cLots of people who earn more than the average or median wage are still living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d Shierholz said. With a lower replacement rate, some of those people might start to struggle to pay for necessities like rent or groceries.\n\nSo if Congress opts to extend the expanded unemployment insurance program past the end of July, politicians will have to decide how much an unevenly distributed benefit really matters, particularly as public health concerns continue to loom. And the fate of the next phase of relief to jobless workers may hinge in part on what state unemployment insurance agencies can actually do. \u201cIt looks like health concerns are going to prevent a fast recovery, so it makes sense to keep a substantial boost to replacement rates,\u201d Chodorow-Reich said. \u201cIn an ideal world, the next round of funds will probably be more tailored to workers\u2019 individual circumstances. The question is whether our totally antiquated systems will be capable of pulling that off.\u201d", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-part-time-consultant-and-uber-driver-navigated-through-filing-for-unemployment/", "published": "2020-05-11T14:00:08", "title": "This Part-Time Consultant And Uber Driver Navigated Through Filing For Unemployment", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nOver the past two months and change, millions of Americans have found themselves in highly vulnerable employment positions. Among those feeling the most pressure are people with ties to the live entertainment industry, which has been brought to its knees by its inability to generate ticket revenue, and people who rely on in-person interaction.\n\nThen there\u2019s Brandi Davidson, who held multiple jobs and earned a solid income but whose gigs fall right in the center of that unfortunate Venn diagram. She worked in public relations for arts festivals, many of which have been canceled by now, and drove part time for Uber.\n\nThe 46-year-old D.C. resident has stopped her Uber work for now: Bookings have fallen as people stay home, and Davidson doesn\u2019t feel safe driving anyway. And her boyfriend, who also drives for Uber to earn part-time income, has a few underlying health conditions that would put him at greater risk if he were to come down with the highly contagious virus.\n\nOf course, the flipside of that vigilance is that the household of three \u2014 they serve as guardians for their 9-year-old godson \u2014 is generating no income at the moment. \u201cI took most of my cash out of the bank when this thing started,\u201d Davidson said. \u201cPart of it was me being nervous. But that pile of cash is almost gone.\u201d\n\nDavidson first noticed something strange in her routing back in late February or early March. She also works as a driver for HopSkipDrive, an Uber-like transportation service that provides rides for young children. Because she lives in the D.C. area, Davidson often drives the kids of dignitaries \u2014 some of whom were beginning to cancel their pre-scheduled rides. A week and a half into March, \u201cI lost about 50 percent of the rides I\u2019d normally get that week,\u201d she said. That was when she realized that her earlier cancellations may have stemmed from a handful of high-ranking federal workers understanding the extent of the virus sooner \u2014 and pulling their kids out of school accordingly.\n\nEach time Davidson looked at her dwindling pile of cash, she thought about getting back in her car. No, she wouldn\u2019t pick up and drop off people, which she considers too risky. But maybe sign up to deliver food for Uber? Then she considered where she lives \u2014 right near a hospital \u2014 and the fact that she\u2019d likely have to deliver to people who are working on patients who may be infected with the virus.\n\nIt\u2019s a damned-if-you-do, damned-if-you-don\u2019t sort of feeling, she says. Many things have felt that way. Back in March, as the virus spread and it was clear that Davidson would have no money coming in, she took the step of filing for unemployment. She got an almost instant rejection. \u201cI knew that couldn\u2019t be the end of the answer,\u201d said Davidson, who has consistently made from $60,000 to $65,000 a year.\n\nShe then called the unemployment office and waited 6\u00bd hours on hold. As long as the wait was, the advice she ended up getting was helpful. She was told that her rejection was likely related to the unusual filing situations of Davidson and her boyfriend: Their Uber roles are considered non-wage jobs, and their consultant positions are seen as independent contractors. Complicated unemployment filings from people in those positions can\u2019t be greenlighted as easily, and first-time rejections are common. Davidson\u2019s adviser told her that the unemployment office would need more time to implement a better-fitting set of filing options for non-wage employees.\n\n\u201cThe system wasn\u2019t made for people like us,\u201d said Davidson, who files quarterly income statements for her work with Uber, which doesn\u2019t report worker income to the government.\n\nEven in light of the marathon call with the unemployment office, Davidson has kept a level head despite the stressful situation. She\u2019s not unfamiliar with being forced to make a situation more workable, having once negotiated a $700 medical bill down to closer to $100.\n\nHer persistence paid off: Aside from receiving their $1,200 stimulus checks, Davidson and her boyfriend finally qualified for unemployment, which has translated into checks for a little less than $800 a week each. \u201cI don\u2019t know what I\u2019d do without unemployment,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not my salary, and of course I\u2019d need to make more at some point, but I feel completely blessed that it eventually came through.\u201d\n\nDavidson and her family have been able to avoid one key challenge facing many American families: They recently moved into a home her boyfriend inherited from his grandmother, eliminating any concerns about monthly housing payments.\n\nStill, as someone whose livelihood depends heavily on people having to be somewhere \u2014 be it a summer festival, or even just needing a ride-sharing option to make it to that festival \u2014 Davidson looks forward to being able to earn again. But she just doesn\u2019t want the reopening process to happen too soon, which could put people like her boyfriend at risk.\n\nDavidson takes that step seriously, so much so that she told her godson\u2019s mother that, because of the risks involved, they couldn\u2019t continue to shuttle the 9-year-old between their homes anymore \u2014 essentially saying either his mother would have to wait out the pandemic to visit with the child again, or that Davidson and her boyfriend would need to.\n\n\u201cI probably cried for three days after that,\u201d she said, adding that they recently decided to have the boy stay with his mother for the time being. \u201cBut that\u2019s how strongly I feel about it. My thought is, when hospitals say it\u2019s safe to go visit a loved one, then I\u2019ll think it\u2019s safe to go out and have things return to normal again.\u201d\n\nWhy does COVID-19 make some people sicker than others? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-terrible-jobs-report-gets-worse-the-more-you-read-it/", "published": "2020-05-08T15:18:06", "title": "The Terrible Jobs Report Gets Worse The More You Read It", "text": "Remember last month, when the jobs report was bad but not apocalyptic? Those were the days. The most recent jobs report is a stunning picture of how the pandemic has reshaped the country\u2019s labor market. Overall, 20.5 million fewer people were employed last month than in March. And the unemployment rate has skyrocketed to 14.7 percent \u2014 by far the worst we\u2019ve seen in more than seven decades of economic data.\n\nBut the speed of the crisis also means that these numbers are already out of date. The jobs report is based on surveys of businesses and households taken during the middle of April, but the economic situation likely worsened as the month went on. And key metrics, like the unemployment rate, aren\u2019t capturing all the people who are actually out of work right now. According to this month\u2019s report, millions of workers were counted as employed even though they were absent from work for an unspecified reason \u2014 and if they had been counted as unemployed on a temporary layoff, the unemployment rate would have been 5 percentage points higher. In other words, as catastrophic as this report might seem, it almost certainly understates the pandemic\u2019s full economic devastation.\n\nTo be clear, that\u2019s not the fault of the researchers at the Bureau of Labor Statistics who put the report together. Our economic data just wasn\u2019t designed for a moment where entire sectors of the economy shut down pretty much overnight, leaving millions of people without jobs. \u201cI think of our economic indicators as being a kind of a finely tuned speedometer that says, \u2018Are we a little over the speed limit or a little under?\u2019\u201d said Matt McDonald, a partner at the consulting firm Hamilton Place Strategies who writes a monthly analysis of the jobs report. \u201cAnd right now it\u2019s like we just pulled the emergency brake on the highway.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the report is useless or wrong. But making sense of the numbers \u2014 and what they mean for our ability to recover from this mess \u2014 is going to take a little more work than usual. Here\u2019s what to bear in mind as you read coverage of the jobs report (or dive into the nitty-gritty yourself) that can help you understand just how bad these numbers are, and what they mean for how the recession could play out.\n\nHeadline numbers may understate the damage\n\nThis month, there are good reasons to dig deeper into the report. There\u2019s always a significant amount of uncertainty in one of the topline numbers \u2014 the 20.5 million jobs that were lost \u2014 but the scale of the damage this month means that this month\u2019s estimate could be off by tens or even hundreds of thousands of jobs. Take the initial revision for payroll losses in March. Last month, the BLS reported that 701,000 jobs were lost. In this month\u2019s report, though, it\u2019s adjusted that to 870,000. And the April job losses are much, much larger, which means this month\u2019s report could be underestimating the magnitude of the damage by a significant amount.\n\nThe one thing we know for sure is that the unemployment rate is historically high. The government has been tracking this number for more than 70 years, and up till now, the peaks were 10.8 percent in 1982 and 10.0 percent in 2009. For context, economic historians estimate that during the Great Depression, the unemployment rate hit a peak of about 25 percent.\n\nThe real number may actually be closer to that Great Depression peak, because by this metric, only people without jobs who have been actively looking for one are considered unemployed. In normal times, that\u2019s already a bit of an issue because it means frustrated job seekers who have given up on finding something aren\u2019t counted. Now, the problem is even bigger because so many workers are being encouraged to stay home to combat the coronavirus. Others might not be job-hunting because they believe there\u2019s no work to be had.\n\n\u201cJob search is going to be tough when it\u2019s a public health risk to be in contact with people and whole sectors of the economy is effectively shut down,\u201d said Nick Bunker, a labor economist at the hiring site Indeed. \u201cSo lots of people who are out of work are probably not going to be included in the unemployment rate.\u201d\n\nThen there\u2019s the possibility that some people may have been counted as employed even though it might be more accurate to say they\u2019re temporarily out of work. The misclassification may have happened because of the way workers are surveyed \u2014 if they say they were absent from work during the entire week that\u2019s referenced in the survey, interviewers follow up and ask why. Usually, the reasons fall into a standard set of buckets \u2014 vacation, childcare responsibilities, illness. But the number of workers who said they were absent from work for \u201cother reasons\u201d skyrocketed once the pandemic started, indicating that some people who had actually been furloughed may have misunderstood the question and answered in a way that indicated they were still employed.\n\nThis was a problem the BLS ran into in March, and again in April. In March, the researchers estimated that about 1.4 million people may have been misclassified as employed when they were actually temporarily out of work due to the pandemic; this month, it\u2019s a whopping 7.5 million people. According to the BLS, the April unemployment rate would have been almost 5 percentage points higher if these people were included.\n\nTo get a clearer picture of just how many people are out of a job, there\u2019s another metric in the report that might be more useful \u2014 the share of the adult population who are employed. This number is particularly helpful in recessions, because that\u2019s when more people are likely to become discouraged and stop looking for work. This month, 51.3 percent of the adult population has a job, down from 60 percent in March. That\u2019s also a historic drop \u2014 and yet that number may also underestimate the damage because of the people who may have been mistakenly classified as employed.\n\nThe damage is widespread\n\nIt\u2019s important, too, to look not just at how many people are out of work, but which sectors of the economy have been hit hardest and which are continuing to do well. \u201cThere\u2019s a real question about how many industries can weather this moment,\u201d said Martha Gimbel, an economist at Schmidt Futures, a philanthropic initiative. In March, the job losses were overwhelmingly concentrated in the leisure and hospitality industry, which includes bars and restaurants. This month, those industries were hit hardest again: leisure and hospitality lost 7.7 million jobs, a decline of 47 percent.\n\nBut the overall job losses were more spread out than they were last month, signaling that the effects of the shutdown are already rippling into other industries. For instance, there were sharp declines in the health care sector, mainly concentrated in dentists\u2019 and private doctors\u2019 offices, many of which were forced to close or lost a significant amount of business due to the pandemic. Retail, professional and business services \u2014 including temporary help services and services to businesses and dwellings \u2014 and manufacturing also lost hundreds of thousands of jobs.\n\nThere were also some noteworthy disparities in who was more likely to be unemployed. The April unemployment rate was highest for Hispanic workers, at 18.9 percent, but black workers (16.7 percent) were also more likely to be unemployed than Asian (14.5 percent) or white (14.2 percent) workers. Racial disparities in the unemployment rate aren\u2019t that unusual \u2014 black workers, for example, generally have a higher unemployment rate than other groups. But the unemployment rate for Hispanic workers in particular was historically high, underscoring a running theme of this pandemic: workers of color are disproportionately bearing the brunt of the economic havoc.\n\nWomen (15.5 percent) also had a higher unemployment rate than men (13 percent) \u2014 which is atypical, since women usually have a lower unemployment rate than men. And in recessions, men are usually the first to feel the impact. But women are more likely to hold jobs in the industries that have been pummeled since the pandemic began, like health care and child care services, which may explain why they\u2019re experiencing more of the job losses this time around.\n\nGimbel told us she\u2019ll also be looking at the diffusion index, which is a measure that shows how many industries are gaining or losing jobs. That number, she said, can tell us at a glance \u201chow widespread the carnage is.\u201d This month, the diffusion index is 4.8, which is shockingly low, and signals that job losses were extremely widespread across industries. In February, for example, the diffusion index was 53.7.\n\nAnother important tidbit that\u2019s not captured in the employment figures but reflects how widespread the damage has been: the number of people who were working part-time because they couldn\u2019t find full-time work or their hours were reduced doubled in April, landing at 10.9 million.\n\nAnd if you\u2019re interested in trying to figure out how painful the recovery might be, you can learn a lot by looking at the share of people who were temporarily laid off in April, rather than permanently fired. This may be the least catastrophic part of the report. As in March, the vast majority of jobs lost in April were temporary: 18.1 million of the newly unemployed said they had lost their jobs temporarily, while 2.0 million said the loss was permanent. To be clear \u2014 in a more normal moment, 2.0 million lost jobs would be an eye-popping number. But the fact that the job losses are mostly temporary is important because it will be much easier for people who have been furloughed to return to work when businesses start to reopen \u2014 assuming, of course, that those businesses haven\u2019t shuttered in the meantime.\n\nRead the fine print\n\nThe jobs report is based on two surveys: one of businesses, and one of ordinary households. Normally, that\u2019s barely worth remarking on. But this is not an ideal time to be doing surveys of businesses or people. Last month, the call centers where the surveys are conducted were shut down, and in-person follow-up interviews aren\u2019t happening either. That increases the uncertainty around the numbers in ways that BLS researchers explained in a 14-page note that accompanied the jobs report.\n\nTake the response rate. Julie Hatch Maxfield, an associate commissioner at the BLS, told us some variation in the share of participants who respond is normal, particularly because the survey of businesses is sometimes conducted on a more truncated timeline. In April, the response rate for the survey of businesses was actually much higher than it was in March. But the response rate for the survey of households was 70 percent, compared to 73 percent in March. That lower response rate introduces more uncertainty \u2014 but it\u2019s hard to know how that uncertainty influenced the data. For example, Gimbel pointed out it\u2019s possible that unemployed people may actually be overrepresented in the household survey, because they have more time to talk with a government interviewer.\n\nAlthough it\u2019s hard to predict what next month\u2019s jobs report will show, it is likely to offer more detail about how the COVID-19 crisis is affecting Americans economically. A series of questions are being added to next month\u2019s survey of households that will capture how the pandemic has changed our work lives \u2014 for instance, whether people are teleworking, or if the crisis has kept them from searching for work. That might not solve all of the problems with the unemployment rate, but it will make the economic picture a little clearer \u2014 although probably not more uplifting.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: COVID-19 broke the jobless claims chart", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-essential-worker-is-busier-than-ever-without-leaving-her-house/", "published": "2020-05-04T14:00:46", "title": "This Essential Worker Is Busier Than Ever Without Leaving Her House", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nThe nation\u2019s unemployment statistics are staggering, and the stories of the workers who constitute those numbers are humbling, including those who suddenly had job offers rescinded and those who have seen their hours cut as a result of the coronavirus\u2019s spread.\n\nBut another reality of this downturn is that some have seen an increase in work the past two months. Many of them hold the kind of essential jobs that wouldn\u2019t immediately come to mind.\n\nRomie Faienza, a 39-year-old Massachusetts resident, is one such person. Faienza works as a closed captioner and specializes in live voice writing \u2014 she listens to what is said during an event and carefully repeats that wording into a microphone connected to her computer, where her speech is transcribed into written words.\n\nShe has had her hands full since the pandemic emerged in the United States. Along with the daily briefings that President Trump had been doing, governors from states across the country started holding news conferences on the fallout from COVID-19. The process of transcribing what is said at them, given their importance and that more people who are hard of hearing would be at home watching the news, is both a busy and critical task for the time being.\n\nBefore all this, Faienza was working 40-hour weeks but was plotting out how she would use the time off she had accumulated. \u201cI actually spoke with my supervisor and said I intended to work a lot less\u201d this year, Faienza said, adding that she uses spare time to edit magazine pieces and write screenplays.\n\nBut then the pandemic happened, totally altering that plan. Now, she\u2019s working 50-hour weeks to keep up.\n\nThe demand for her work appears to go beyond just the additional hours. Faienza said another captioning company reached out to her recently, in the hopes of convincing her to consider a job with them. \u201cI said, \u2018Look, I\u2019m flattered, but I can\u2019t entertain the idea of making a big change right now,\u2019\u201d she said.\n\nThe notion of stability has always been meaningful for Faienza. Her voice has to remain consistently level \u2014 both in terms of volume and intonation \u2014 to ensure her captioning will come across clearly and accurately. And from a financial standpoint, she and her husband had made a point to save pretty aggressively in case something unforeseen came up.\n\nThings seem solid for now for Faienza, who made just less than $50,000 last year and is the family\u2019s breadwinner. With overtime, she\u2019s earning about $200 more per paycheck, and her stimulus money is still on the way as well. Lately, she\u2019s used some of her overtime pay to purchase gift cards at suburban Boston-area restaurants. \u201cI want these places to still be there when all of this is over,\u201d she said.\n\nFaienza\u2019s real challenge has been in areas that others throughout the country can likely relate to: the emotional toll the news can take on those who, like Faienza, have no choice but to immerse themselves in it.\n\nWhile her work itself hasn\u2019t fundamentally changed \u2014 \u201cMy life was already pretty socially distanced, because I work from home in a studio with the door closed,\u201d she said \u2014 it\u2019s challenging for her to put in a few extra hours each day because she has two young sons, 6 and 8 years old. The older child has said he misses being in school \u2014 and not just because he doesn\u2019t get to see his friends and teacher. He told Faienza that he genuinely misses the sense of achievement that accompanies doing a good job on a test or an assignment.\n\nFortunately, the kids are positioned well from a schooling standpoint: Ciro, Faienza\u2019s husband, is serving as their teacher for now. And the transition is likely smoother for him than for other parents, since he already has teaching experience, having previously taught English to people looking to acquire it as a foreign language.\n\nFaienza\u2019s parents, who are about 70 years old, live with the rest of the family, so the concept of leaving the house for an outing of some sort hasn\u2019t been entertained. But the kids seem to have adapted to that part of the deal OK so far.\n\n\u201cWe\u2019re all pretty nerdy anyway. Because we\u2019re in Massachusetts, we\u2019ve had snowstorms before, where we\u2019ve been stuck inside for a long time,\u201d she said. \u201cSo there\u2019s lots of playing board games, watching movies, playing video games, listening to each other. There\u2019s always been a lot of that. And we do have a backyard, which isn\u2019t huge, but it\u2019s enough to go outside to do chalk drawings or toss the ball around.\u201d\n\nPerhaps the strangest element of all this for Faienza was the timing; it felt as if she were seeing the country through a time machine of sorts. She knew pretty early, for instance, that the coronavirus situation in China had gotten serious because an increasing amount of the news conferences she had to caption here in the states were on that subject. That led her, around the first week of March, to urge her parents to avoid taking communion at church and avoid shaking anyone\u2019s hands there. At that same time, she also told a family friend to place an order for CPAP equipment, since the parts figured to become more difficult to get as the virus continued to spread \u2014 and might possibly shut entire industries down.\n\nThat feeling of time travel grew more surreal as Faienza captioned news conferences in New York, where the virus was ravaging the state. Seeing all the steps that officials were taking there as several other states delayed or opted against implementing stay-at-home orders prompted her to worry the nation didn\u2019t grasp the seriousness of the virus, and that its transmission might not slow down in a timely fashion.\n\nFaienza\u2019s hope now is that, soon enough, we\u2019ll be able to go back in time. Then she will be able to make use of those gift cards she bought to patronize the local restaurants as we get back a semblance of what everyday American life was like before the coronavirus erased that notion for millions of people.\n\nFiveThirtyEight Politics Podcast: The US is starting to reopen. Is it ready?", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/what-we-know-about-crises-and-domestic-violence-and-what-that-could-mean-for-covid-19/", "published": "2020-05-04T11:00:10", "title": "What We Know About Crises And Domestic Violence \u2014 And What That Could Mean For COVID-19", "text": "The novel coronavirus pandemic, in addition to its direct impact on people\u2019s health, has unleashed a perfect storm of conditions that may increase the rate of domestic violence. Social isolation, for example, is one of the most common tactics used by abusers to distance survivors from their support networks, and now physical isolation is government-sanctioned. Unemployment claims are hitting historic highs, as are levels of economic anxiety; both of these circumstances are linked to a higher incidence of domestic violence. Firearm ownership is tied to a greater chance of domestic homicide, and gun sales in the U.S. rocketed in March, with reports that many of those sales were to first-time gun buyers. National hotlines even have to devise strategies to combat abusers\u2019 weaponizing COVID-19 itself to terrorize survivors \u2014 e.g., threatening to infect someone with COVID-19 or hiding cleaning supplies so the survivor cannot access them.\n\nThe relationship between these factors and domestic violence is well researched and well documented, as many other articles have discussed. But tracking the pandemic\u2019s actual effects on domestic violence is nearly impossible. Many people who experience abuse don\u2019t report it through official channels. Stigma and fear of retribution are just a few of the reasons someone wouldn\u2019t contact the police. Because of that, we don\u2019t have good data showing domestic violence incidence in normal times, let alone now. In fact, we\u2019re getting conflicting signals at the moment \u2014 while the National Domestic Violence Hotline continued to see its average of 1,800 to 2,000 contacts a day through March and April, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo announced on Friday that reports of domestic violence rose in the state during that same time.\n\nSo while we have solid, empirically derived reasons to believe that COVID-19 might increase the rate of domestic violence across the country, we don\u2019t have the numbers to back that claim. That can make the issue feel less real to the public and to policymakers, even though, due to the impact of COVID-19, the increase in intimate partner violence (IPV) \u2014 i.e., physical, psychological or sexual harm in an intimate relationship \u2014 may be significant.\n\nHow significant? There\u2019s no perfect case study to draw from, but we can make some reasonable conclusions by looking at research on IPV and past disasters with some similarities to the COVID-19 crisis.\n\nEconomic anxiety and joblessness\n\nEconomic hardship, employment instability, unemployment and perceptions of economic strain have all been linked to IPV, according to Jennifer Copp, a professor at Florida State University\u2019s College of Criminology and Criminal Justice. Domestic violence is about power and control, and when your job, finances and livelihood are all up in the air, abuse becomes a place where people seek to regain that sense of control.\n\nIndeed, a 2001 research report from the National Institute of Justice found that rates of violence in couples experiencing high levels of financial stress were 3 1/2 times the rates in couples with low levels of stress \u2014 rising to 9.5 percent from 2.7 percent. According to a working paper by the Center for Global Development, the effects of unemployment on IPV vary across populations due to cultural differences, but in the U.S., the NIJ found in 2009 that periods of unemployment by a man in a heterosexual relationship are correlated with significantly elevated rates of abuse. That paper didn\u2019t show a causal link but found that couples in which the man was employed had a 4.7 percent prevalence of abuse, while that figure was 7.5 percent for couples in which the man experienced one period of unemployment and 12.3 percent for couples in which the man experienced two or more periods of unemployment.\n\nEconomically, the most recent circumstances analogous to the current pandemic may be those caused by the Great Recession, when the overall unemployment rate doubled from 5 percent in December 2007 to 10 percent in October 2009 and the net worth of households and nonprofits fell over 20 percent, a loss of some $14 trillion, in a year and a half. A 2016 study published in \u201cDemography\u201d on economic indicators and IPV during the Great Recession found that an increase in the unemployment rate was correlated with a small but significant change in IPV \u2014 a 50 percent increase in the unemployment rate over the prior 12-month period, for example, was associated with a 10 to 12 percent increase in the prevalence of physically violent or controlling behavior in intimate relationships.\n\nOf course, a correlation between economic hardship and IPV may be due to other factors that are linked to greater hardship or job loss and IPV \u2014 such as mental illness, stress or substance abuse. Establishing a causal relationship is much more difficult since economic hardship typically goes hand in hand with many other variables. Yet coupled with what we know about the interplay of economic precarity and domestic violence, the economic fallout of COVID-19 presents perhaps one of the greatest risks in terms of increasing abuse.\n\nNatural disasters\n\nIt\u2019s more difficult to draw comparisons between behavior after natural disasters and the current COVID-19 pandemic. Generally, though, women have a much more precarious social and economic standing than men, and that vulnerability only increases during a disaster. Normal resources and social support that usually curb abuse can disappear entirely depending on the type of disaster \u2014 hotlines, access to legal help and shelter availability can all be disrupted. On top of that, IPV increases in the aftermath of disasters, but many factors are at play that don\u2019t apply as much to COVID-19 \u2014 most notably displacement, which is not yet a major effect of the pandemic.\n\nWhile research has shown that economic downturns are accompanied by physical, mental and emotional violence, the intersection of gender-based violence and disasters is only a recent area of focus. It\u2019s unclear whether increased violence is a simple matter of proximity or of stress or some other unknown variable.\n\nStill, it\u2019s worth looking at some examples that may hold lessons for dealing with the current pandemic, as long as we keep in mind that the circumstances of the COVID-19 crisis are quite different. In 2011, a 6.2 magnitude earthquake hit Christchurch, New Zealand, causing 185 deaths and thousands of injuries in addition to severe structural damage. Two weeks after the earthquake, area police said that reports of domestic violence had risen by a fifth. Afterward, police cited business closures as a reason why more people were drinking at home, aggravating the risk of domestic violence. Sexual violence rose after Hurricane Katrina, as many people were forced into temporary shelters. In the first six months after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, nearly 40 percent of sexual assaults were committed by strangers (versus the 19.5 percent committed by strangers in all reported cases of sexual assault in the U.S.); 31 percent of these assaults took place in shelters or evacuation sites. For people whose lives were highly disrupted by the 1989 Exxon Valdez oil spill in Alaska, there was a nearly threefold increase in the likelihood of experiencing domestic violence afterward compared with people who experienced no disruption.\n\nOne of the most striking findings to come out of research on domestic violence in the wake of a natural disaster is that, separate from the rate of abuse changing, the severity of abuse can increase as well. In the aforementioned study of sexual assaults after Hurricanes Katrina and Rita, researchers found that in the early aftermath of the disaster, \u201crapes appeared to be more brutal, often involving multiple offenders,\u201d and then returned to a more typical pattern a year later. After the 1997 Red River Valley flood, which displaced over 50,000 people in Grand Forks, North Dakota, and East Grand Forks, Minnesota, and damaged nearly all homes in the area, referrals to domestic violence shelters from emergency rooms increased, possibly pointing to a rise in severity of physical abuse. Even now, Katie Ray-Jones, CEO of the National Domestic Violence Hotline, said that survivors contacting them have seen an escalation in abuse tactics \u2014 including one person who said her partner pulled out a gun to prevent her from leaving the house, something that had never happened before.\n\nIn some ways at least, the COVID-19 pandemic is less problematic regarding IPV than other disasters: Most hotlines are still operational, and while shelter availability varies depending on locale, there hasn\u2019t been a natural event that wipes out the structures. Many domestic violence services are still operating and are able to offer support, although survivors may be less willing to go to one for fear of catching COVID-19. Nathaniel Fields, CEO of Urban Resource Institute in New York, an organization that provides resources and shelter for survivors of domestic violence, said that their priority right now is communication \u2014 when everyone, including your friends, neighbors and the government, is telling you to stay home, it can be hard to leave an abusive situation. Survivors find themselves doing the mental calculus of whether it\u2019s safer to stay home with the devil you know or risk the COVID-19 you don\u2019t.\n\nBut those silver linings aside, the COVID-19 pandemic is still likely meaningfully increasing the rate of domestic violence. Past downturns and disasters doubled or even tripled those rates. Those were each unique circumstances, making it hard to say if something similar will happen now. Indeed, Claire Renzetti, a professor of sociology at the University of Kentucky, didn\u2019t offer any speculation as to the scale of an increase. But she said that knowing what we know from previous experiences that haven\u2019t been as bad as this one, our current economic climate will likely increase IPV.\n\nMoreover, in normal times, domestic violence doesn\u2019t affect all populations equally, and these inequities are likely to be exacerbated during the pandemic. Some studies have found that low-income, black and Hispanic populations are more likely to experience IPV than white populations or those with post-secondary education. Those are the same groups bearing a disproportionate share of the direct health and economic effects of the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWe probably won\u2019t have the data to show much of this for years, if ever. Data collection during disasters suffers from logistical difficulties, and quantitative insights on domestic violence are chronically underreported. But that doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s not happening.\n\nLaura Bronner contributed research.\n\nHelp is available.

According to Thursday\u2019s data release from the Department of Labor, 3.8 million more Americans filed for unemployment insurance during the week ending April 25. Although that represents the fourth consecutive week of decline in seasonally adjusted initial claims, the number remains historic. (Remember, no single week prior to March 21 had ever seen even 1 million initial claims since 1967, the earliest year that data is available from the Federal Reserve.) If we add up all of the initial claims filed since the coronavirus recession began, more than 30 million people \u2014 or nearly 19 percent of the total U.S. labor force \u2014 have filed for unemployment claims over the past month and a half.\n\nExperts have all had their eyes trained on initial unemployment claims, both because they tell us about the ongoing scale of the crisis and because they\u2019re one of the rare weekly indicators of the economy at large. Some economists think this weekly trend of massive unemployment numbers includes industries that weren\u2019t hit hard at first but are now beginning to feel the ripple effects of the recession as it spreads through the economy. \u201cJob separations will likely remain high for a while, as softer demand spills over into industries not initially directly affected by shutdowns,\u201d Citigroup economist Andrew Hollenhorst told Reuters. (This is corroborated by sources such as the hiring site Indeed, which has consistently seen 30 to 40 percent fewer jobs posted than the norm since late March.)\n\nOf course, this week\u2019s data still includes many unemployment claims that overwhelmed state agencies were not able to process immediately after they were filed. And there are still many workers struggling week by week in industries directly affected by coronavirus shutdowns, such as in restaurants or other parts of the service sector. Several weeks ago, we pointed to research by St. Louis Fed economist Miguel Faria-e-Castro, who estimated that nearly 50 million jobs were at risk as the country tried to mitigate the virus\u2019s spread. If our current slight downward pattern of initial claims continues each week, we would reach that mark by July.\n\nBut will the numbers continue in that same pattern? One of the hallmarks of this crisis is the high number of furloughs \u2014 people who are out of work now (and therefore able to file initial claims) but who could potentially return to their jobs when the economy restarts. A recent analysis from the California Policy Lab found that 90 percent of that state\u2019s workers who filed for unemployment in early April expected to go back to their previous jobs, a much higher share than the 40 percent who gave that response in February. With many states moving toward reopening at least some businesses by next week, a large number of those who filed claims earlier in the crisis could potentially be returning to work.\n\nThat\u2019s why another important indicator will be what\u2019s called continued claims, or insured unemployment \u2014 the number of people actually receiving unemployment benefits in any given week. (According to the Department of Labor, that number was 17,992,000 for the week ending April 18.) It lags a week behind initial claims, since not all initial claimants are actually eligible to receive payments, but it gives us a faster-moving measure of where the crisis might be headed than the traditional unemployment rate, which is released each month. The decline of continued claims tends to go in lockstep with the end of recessions, and it will be important to watch how that metric changes as the restarting economy begins to go through another phase of incredible upheaval over the next month.\n\n\u2018We have a ways to go until data\u2019 allows states to reopen: Nate Silver", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-americans-who-suffered-when-the-economy-shut-down-are-also-in-more-danger-as-it-reopens/", "published": "2020-04-28T17:33:33", "title": "The Americans Who Suffered When The Economy Shut Down Are Also In More Danger As It Reopens", "text": "It\u2019s been more than six weeks since Daniel last rode his bike to his office, where he works on the business operations team at a beverage company in the Pacific Northwest.

Even when restrictions are lifted on companies like his, he doesn\u2019t expect to be spending a lot of time at the office. \u201cI\u2019ll go back for certain meetings if things start to reopen, but for the most part I think we\u2019re going to be remote for the foreseeable future,\u201d he said.\n\nDaniel knows not everyone has that luxury. \u201cI just keep saying to myself \u2014 I\u2019m one of the lucky ones, because I\u2019ve basically been able to continue working unaffected,\u201d he said.\n\nAs the COVID-19 crisis continues, the ability to work from home could turn into one of the most important markers of privilege for American workers.\n\nAccording to a survey of 25,000 respondents fielded online April 1\u20135, more than 34 percent of people who were employed four weeks earlier reported that they used to commute to work, but were now working from home. Add that to the nearly 15 percent of respondents who said they were already working from home, and nearly half the country is teleworking.\n\nBut the ability to work remotely isn\u2019t randomly distributed \u2014 it\u2019s concentrated among people who are already more likely to have higher incomes and more stable employment.\n\nIn a recent working paper, economists Simon Mongey, Laura Pilossoph and Alex Weinberg created two metrics to understand which workers will be hit especially hard by the coronavirus crisis, using data from the Labor Department. The first measures the extent to which a given occupation can be performed from home, and the other measures the amount of close proximity to other people that the job requires. Sure enough, the jobs that are likely harder to do from home or are more likely to involve close physical proximity tend to be filled by people who are more economically vulnerable. For instance, jobs that are more difficult to work from home are disproportionately held by lower-income workers.\n\nThis research generally aligns with other recent studies that have found that the COVID-19 crisis has had a bigger economic impact on people with lower incomes and levels of education. That dynamic is now going to force many poorer Americans to choose between their safety and a paycheck as the economy starts to reopen.\n\nOne of those workers who could soon be facing that unpleasant calculus is Erica Harrison, who lost her job setting up displays at a department store in Louisiana last month. She was already struggling to live on $12 per hour, and spent the last few weeks scrambling to get her unemployment insurance payments set up so she could buy groceries and make her car payments. Now she finally has enough money to support herself \u2014 but a few days after her benefits started to arrive, her supervisor called to ask how she\u2019d feel about coming back to her job if the store was able to reopen.\n\nThe idea of returning to work knocked her back on her heels. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrifying thought because the risk of getting sick is so high,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cIt\u2019s literally my job to touch everything in the store \u2014 the fixtures, the mannequins, the plexiglass.\u201d She lives with her mother, who recently recovered from heart surgery, so Harrison is especially concerned about spreading the virus to family members. But she had to take her supervisor\u2019s question seriously. She lost her health insurance along with her job, and she\u2019s wary of turning down work in the midst of a recession. And she would probably no longer qualify for unemployment benefits if she was offered her job back and chose not to return. \u201cIn my mind it pretty much comes down to: do you care more about your money or your health?\u201d she said. \u201cI wish there was a way for me to stay indoors and keep getting my paycheck. But that option is not available to me.\u201d\n\nThe problem for Harrison isn\u2019t simply that it\u2019s impossible to do her job from home. Her job also involves close contact with other people, putting her at higher risk for contracting or spreading the virus if she did come back to work. She isn\u2019t alone. The economists\u2019 research shows that jobs that require close physical proximity are disproportionately occupied by poorer Americans.\n\nAnd the workers who are disproportionately represented in both kinds of jobs are also more economically vulnerable. Many of the jobs where working from home is more difficult are held by workers without a college degree, and those workers are also overrepresented in jobs that require more face-to-face interaction. The same is true of lower-income workers, who make up more than half of workers in jobs where working from home is unlikely to be feasible and of jobs that involve closer proximity to other people.\n\nThis means that workers who were hit hardest by the economic shutdown are also disproportionately likely to suffer as the recovery unfolds. In places where the economy is being reopened more quickly, they\u2019ll have to confront the prospect of returning to dangerous work before the virus is fully contained. In places where economic activity is remaining frozen for longer \u2014 or only only partially resuming \u2014 they may face longer-term unemployment if their employers can\u2019t reopen quickly or fully. Unemployment benefits can be a salve, especially since the federal government temporarily boosted the amounts by $600 per week. But many Americans\u2019 benefits have not been processed. And that extra money is currently scheduled to stop at the end of July. But the economy probably won\u2019t be back to normal by then. \u201cIf the recovery begins by bringing back workers who are in jobs where they don\u2019t have a lot of contact with other people, that will mean people in high physical proximity jobs will be hurting economically for longer,\u201d Mongey said.\n\nOf course, not everyone who has transitioned to teleworking is leading a charmed life. Daniel was almost apologetic about his good fortune \u2014 he\u2019s young, with no kids and a well-paying job, leaving him plenty of time for Zoom catch-ups with friends and road biking. In some ways, his financial situation has actually improved. He and his partner are rarely ordering out for food, and he got a flood of refunds as races he\u2019d signed up to run over the next few months were canceled.\n\nBut other workers, like Kyrie Martin, a high school math teacher in California, told us they can\u2019t wait to get back to their old, analog workplace. \u201cIt\u2019s maddening enough to try to teach AP Statistics remotely without my first-grade daughter coming in and playing hangman with the students on the whiteboard behind me,\u201d Martin said. But she was quick to add how lucky she felt to still be working.\n\nAnd Martin\u2019s job as a public school teacher probably isn\u2019t in danger of disappearing. As Harrison weighed her options, she was alarmed to see reports that big department stores like Neiman Marcus have been among the first economic casualties of the economic crisis. She wonders if her employer might be next, even if it manages to reopen. \u201cIf I\u2019m questioning if it\u2019s safe to come to work for a paycheck, who\u2019s going to want to come in of their own free will to shop?\u201d she said.\n\nIt\u2019s not an irrational fear. After past recessions, some of the lost jobs didn\u2019t come back when the recovery began \u2014 particularly lower-paying positions that don\u2019t require specialized skills.\n\nIn the meantime, Harrison\u2019s days are full of anxiety and boredom. \u201cWhen this quarantine started, I tried to get up early, keep up a routine, stay productive, but that\u2019s kind of fallen apart,\u201d she said. \u201cPretty much my only regular activity these days is going to the store to see if they\u2019ve restocked on Lysol.\u201d When her unemployment benefits started to hit her bank account, she could at least stop worrying about covering next month\u2019s car payment. But she\u2019s not optimistic about what will happen when the economy begins to open up again. \u201cWhen things start going back to normal, I think I\u2019m going to end up sick or unemployed.\u201d\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux", "Julia Wolfe"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-moved-to-the-city-and-started-a-thriving-business-then-he-needed-a-loan-to-make-rent/", "published": "2020-04-27T14:00:37", "title": "He Moved To The City And Started A Thriving Business.

Please share your experience with us.\n\nAs 40-year-old Adam Bee approached his one-year anniversary as a New York City resident, he felt more and more confident that his decision to move there was a good one.\n\nBee had recently moved to the big city to start work as a sort of consultant, and business was taking off. He had just led a successful work retreat, and his client bookings were reaching new heights both in number and frequency. The uptick allowed the Tennessee native to rent a bigger two-bedroom apartment \u2014 which meant he could see clients from a home office \u2014 and gave him the money to finally purchase a monthly health care plan in March.\n\nBut as the novel coronavirus started to spread early that month, businesses shut down rapidly, perhaps none more rapidly than Bee\u2019s. As a sex coach \u2014 he works with individuals and couples to be more in sync sexually and spiritually \u2014 Bee saw his income dry up all at once, even before stay-at-home orders were issued for New York state.\n\nShould we sacrifice our data privacy to fight the coronavirus?\n\n\u201cIt was my decision to shut things down and cancel the remaining classes I had scheduled,\u201d said Bee, whose coaching sessions were held in person. \u201cIt just felt like the ethical thing to do.\u201d\n\nBut the hit was significant. At the peak of his success, he was bringing in between $8,000 and $12,000 a month, charging clients $3,500 for a set of five sessions. (In a global city like New York, the demand for his \u201csacred-intimacy\u201d services \u2014 and clients\u2019 ability to pay for them \u2014 was a key part of Bee\u2019s calculation to move there.) In his mind, there wasn\u2019t an immediate way to still do his work safely and in person while justifying that kind of cost, especially with other people finding themselves out of work by the millions because of the pandemic.\n\n\u201cI was in a complete place of fear,\u201d Bee said. \u201cFor the first two weeks of this, I just kind of stared at the wall.\u201d He gave some thought to looking for work in his previous fields \u2014 politics and marketing \u2014 before realizing that those options, too, had likely thinned considerably as a result of the cratering economy. Between the wails of ambulance sirens, he\u2019d break down in tears at times, thinking about just how dire his situation was: \u201cI was going to be homeless in a matter of days.\u201d\n\nIneligible for unemployment, Bee has done what he could do to eliminate spending. The bronze health care plan he\u2019d gotten days earlier for $476 a month with a $5,000 deductible? He scrapped it entirely and followed that up by applying for Medicaid (his application has been approved). The virus has made Bee more or less terrified of walking into a grocery store, so he limits himself to one trip every three weeks now. That has also helped him save money, though his diet these days has gotten pretty mundane, consisting mostly of grains and beans.\n\nThe biggest financial help for Bee was a $10,000 loan from a friend to cover his Upper East Side rent until his lease expires. \u201cThat was pretty fucking special,\u201d he said of his friend\u2019s generosity. Bee plans to hunt for a cheaper living situation once the lease runs out this summer.\n\nThe other bright spot has been the slight rebound in Bee\u2019s business. After those initial despondent weeks, he eventually concluded that it might be possible to do his coaching virtually, as opposed to in-person only. With that in mind, Bee spruced up his website, and by the third week of March, he began holding virtual sessions. That first week alone, he coached more than 100 people. \u201cMy web traffic is more than double what it used to be,\u201d he said.\n\nThis isn\u2019t to say that things are back to how they were before. Bee is charging a mere fraction of his old rate \u2014 $750 for five sessions \u2014 so it takes him five times as many virtual bookings to make what he earned for in-person meetings. \u201cI\u2019m having to work more now than I ever have in my life,\u201d he said.\n\nBee is cautiously optimistic that his in-person clients will return once society is closer to normal again, adding to his burgeoning online business. \u201cI\u2019ve got clients in five states and a couple different countries now,\u201d he said.

After spiking to 6.9 million for the week ending on March 28, the number of new seasonally adjusted claims has gone down each successive week, though the numbers are still astronomical. About 26.5 million Americans have filed for unemployment over the past five weeks, the same number you would get if you added up the initial-claims numbers from March 14 going back to Nov. 25 \u2026 of 2017.\n\nJust to put all of this further in perspective: If the total U.S. labor force is 163 million strong, at least 16 percent of it has now lost a job since mid-March. (And that\u2019s without even accounting for the previous unemployment rate of around 3.5 percent that existed before the coronavirus really hit the U.S.) COVID-19 is creating an unemployment crisis unlike anything America has seen in a very, very long time.\n\nPerhaps that explains some of why we\u2019re beginning to see backlash against the full stay-at-home orders that have been enacted in 42 states and the District of Columbia as a means of slowing the coronavirus\u2019s spread. A number of states have seen protesters descend on their capitols to decry the lockdowns, and the governors of several states, including Georgia and South Carolina, have announced plans to reopen their economies.\n\nPublic outcry is not exactly unexpected when frustrations mount over lost wages in the middle of a national disaster. But are the protests really about unemployment and economic hardship? In some states, it would make sense \u2014 if you add up the advance unemployment claims filed in Michigan since March 15, they account for 24 percent of the state\u2019s labor force. That\u2019s a massive amount of unemployment, the likes of which would seem to be driving the anger we saw in Lansing last week. However, the relationship isn\u2019t nearly as clear-cut when you look at every state.\n\nOverall, according to news reports, there were 28 states over the past week with gatherings of at least 100 people protesting stay-at-home orders and six with at least 1,000 people, out of a possible 42 states (plus Washington, D.C.) with shelter-in-place orders. When looking at what would predict whether a locked-down state would have a protest of at least 100 people, we broke down each state based on the share of the labor force that has filed advance claims since March 15; the state\u2019s number of confirmed coronavirus cases; the number of days since the state enacted the lockdown; and the party affiliation of the governor. Here are the averages in each of those categories, depending on whether the state saw a protest:\n\nProtest states have had less COVID-19 \u2014 and unemployment Economic, public-health and political averages among states (and the District of Columbia) with lockdown orders, by whether the state had an anti-lockdown protest of at least 100 people States with\u2026 Protests No Protest Count 28 15 Advance claims as share of labor force 15.0% 16.3% COVID-19 cases per million 1,933.3 2,685.0 Days since lockdown 26.5 26.9 Share w/ Democratic governors* 57.1% 60.0% *Including the mayor of Washington, D.C. Sources: Department of Labor, The New York Times\n\nNone of the differences above are statistically significant, but they do show a few interesting trends about which states have protests \u2014 and why. On average, states with protests have 28 percent fewer confirmed coronavirus cases than states without protests, which might play into a mindset that places the economic fallout of the crisis ahead of the virus\u2019s health implications. But states with protests have also seen smaller shares of their workforce file advance unemployment claims than their counterparts, which suggests that the protests are not purely economic in nature. (Although 15 percent of the labor force filing for unemployment in a five-week span is certainly not nothing.) Protest states have also been under lockdown for slightly fewer days, on average, than states without protests.\n\nPerhaps most surprising in this breakdown is that a larger share of protest states had Republican governors than the states without protests, given the perception (from states like Michigan and California) that protesters \u2014 often organized by conservative interest groups \u2014 were trying to undermine Democratic governors\u2019 stay-at-home orders. (Then again, maybe this simply speaks to a more right-leaning tendency for the populations of states that saw protests.)\n\nAs the job-loss numbers continue to pile up over the coming weeks, we may see even more people pile out of their houses to argue against the coronavirus stay-at-home orders. But the numbers above show that there\u2019s more than just economics at work behind the protests.\n\nSara Ziegler contributed research.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/this-is-hard-for-everyone-its-even-harder-for-parents-who-dont-make-much-money/", "published": "2020-04-23T19:59:29", "title": "This Is Hard For Everyone. It\u2019s Even Harder For Parents Who Don\u2019t Make Much Money.", "text": "The COVID-19 crisis has turned parents\u2019 lives upside down. Kids are home from school and daycare, and parents of all economic means are struggling to care for them. But while parents who are still working might be teetering between madness and exhaustion, workers who have suddenly lost jobs and income are facing a different kind of balancing act. That\u2019s particularly the case for low-wage workers. Even when the economy was good, many were already struggling with stress and financial insecurity. Now they\u2019re in an even more precarious position.\n\nA recent survey of low-wage parents gives us an unusually detailed window into the stressful new reality that some of the country\u2019s most vulnerable families are facing. Elizabeth Ananat, an economics professor at Barnard College and Anna Gassman-Pines, a public policy professor at Duke University, started the study last summer. The plan was to periodically survey the same pool of almost 700 parents who work for hourly wages in the service industry in a large U.S. city, recording the everyday pressures and anxieties that shaped low-income families\u2019 lives. Then the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and their project took on new meaning.\n\nBy chance, one of their surveys was conducted between late February and late March, and captured the impact of last month\u2019s economic trainwreck in real time. The first inkling that something profound had changed in the survey participants\u2019 lives came in mid-March. That was right around the time that the city where they lived issued a sweeping lockdown order, closing schools and nonessential businesses. (The researchers are keeping the city anonymous to protect participants\u2019 privacy.) Two things happened almost immediately: According to a series of short daily surveys, respondents\u2019 mental health took a sudden nosedive, and so did the hours they reported having worked that day. \u201cThis is a group that\u2019s already experiencing a lot of stress, so any increase is noteworthy,\u201d Gassman-Pines said. \u201cAnd their stress and anxiety went way, way up after the nonessential businesses closed and their work hours fell.\u201d\n\nIt also exposed how quickly their financial situation could turn from precarious to untenable. In addition to their monthlong survey, Ananat and Gassman-Pines sent out a separate, one-time survey in late March to gauge in more detail how respondents were doing. Less than half of the parents surveyed said that they would get any pay for lost work, including sick leave. And more than one-third reported that their income had fallen by more than half since the crisis began. Almost half of the parents in their sample had already lost their jobs.\n\nThe research gives a rare glimpse into what happened to this group of people during the devastating two-week window in March when millions of low-wage workers abruptly lost their jobs. Most of the surveys you\u2019re used to reading about on FiveThirtyEight are designed to give a broad, comprehensive snapshot of how Americans of all stripes feel about a particular issue. But in pursuit of a result that is actually representative of the country, pollsters and researchers often sacrifice the ability to zero in on the experiences of small, highly specific slices of the population, such as the low-wage parents in Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey. Their findings are, in turn, limited in important ways \u2014 their respondents live in the same city, work in the same types of jobs (like retail, hospitality or house cleaning), and are all parents of young children. But when I talked to parents across the country who lost jobs and income as a result of the COVID-19 crisis \u2014 many of whom were already struggling financially \u2014 their stress and anxiety was palpable, and most were struggling to find any kind of support.\n\nMuch of the impact is falling on mothers like Chelsey Johnson, 27, who lives in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, with her 10-year-old daughter. (Johnson was not part of the survey.) Right after she lost her job as a server and bartender at a local Creole restaurant, she tried to apply for unemployment insurance and was told she wasn\u2019t eligible because a previous employer hadn\u2019t paid into the program. She found another job, bagging and delivering lunches to local kids, but it pays less and puts her in contact with other people all day.\n\nFor women like Johnson, the COVID-19 crisis is magnifying the inequalities they already grapple with on a daily basis. According to research by the National Women\u2019s Law Center, 74 percent of parents in the country\u2019s 40 lowest-paying jobs are mothers. A survey by Lean In conducted in April found that women \u2014 particularly black women \u2014 were more worried than men about paying for basic necessities. It\u2019s no wonder that the pandemic took a greater immediate emotional toll on mothers of children under the age of 18, who were substantially more likely than fathers to say the coronavirus crisis has had a negative impact on their mental health, according to a survey conducted by the Kaiser Family Foundation in March.\n\n\u201cI just have to keep praying I don\u2019t get the virus because how else am I going to make money for my baby and me?\u201d Johnson said. Everything, she said, felt like it was falling apart \u2014 even her ability to access government resources, like food stamps, that she had gotten before. At work, while she put together lunches, she was on hold with the food stamp office for hours, trying to figure out why she hadn\u2019t received a key piece of paperwork to finish her application. \u201cI\u2019m a pretty positive person and I already knew how to shuffle my money around to make it all work \u2014 pay a little bit on my rent, my car note, try to catch up when I can,\u201d she said. \u201cBut my income is taking a hit and I\u2019m worried about getting sick. This is a whole new level of stress.\u201d\n\nIn theory, Johnson\u2019s predicament should be unusual \u2014 many states loosened restrictions on unemployment insurance to make it easier for the newly jobless to apply, and governments rushed to make other emergency services, like food pickups for kids, available to people who had suddenly lost their income. But Ananat and Gassman-Pines\u2019s survey found that most people who needed these benefits weren\u2019t receiving them quickly. By the end of last month, less than half of the survey respondents who had been laid off had applied for unemployment insurance, and a tiny fraction of applicants (8 percent) had received it. And most of the parents also weren\u2019t getting the government resources that were supposed to help them feed and educate the kids who were suddenly home from school. Only about half of the parents surveyed said that their children were receiving school lessons online, and very small shares said they had accessed emergency benefits like emergency child care or grab-and-go meals.\n\nIn the weeks that have passed since the survey closed, more parents in the survey have undoubtedly started to receive other benefits. But their precarious financial position meant that every day of delay made paying bills or buying food even more difficult. In late March, some parents in the survey were already struggling to pay for essentials: About one-fifth of respondents said they would be unable to pay rent in the next month if the crisis continued. And the creaky machinery of government bureaucracy has delayed unemployment insurance payments, snarled food stamp applications and held up relief checks.\n\nEven the prospect of applying for unemployment insurance was difficult for Israel Torres, 35, a father of two who works as a culinary specialist at a university in Los Angeles. When we spoke, the university was planning to furlough its workers in a few days. (They ended up extending the deadline by a month after pressure from the workers and the union.)\n\n\u201cI\u2019m trying to stay calm and not make this situation stressful for the kids, but it\u2019s really hard when I\u2019m thinking all the time about what happens if I stop getting paid, how I\u2019ll cover my bills,\u201d he said. Torres and his family live paycheck to paycheck, he said, and they were already struggling because he lost his second job at a theater that closed down early in the crisis. His children were chafing at the order to stay indoors, asking their dad if they were in prison. It was difficult enough, he said, to try to keep the children entertained and engaged with their schoolwork, and avoid falling into a depression. \u201cI know I can apply for unemployment insurance if I get furloughed but I don\u2019t know how much money I\u2019d get or when it would come in,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m afraid it would be too late for us.\u201d\n\nThen there are the parents who won\u2019t get any government aid at all \u2014 in particular, people who are living in the country illegally and aren\u2019t eligible for benefits. Ananat and Gassman-Pines didn\u2019t ask about immigration status in their survey, but since some estimates indicate that people living in the country illegally make up a significant chunk of the service industry, they\u2019re among the workers who have been especially hard hit.\n\nAmelia Rojas, who lives with her husband and four children in Connecticut, stopped going to her job as a housekeeper because she was worried about catching the virus and passing it to her children. Her husband doesn\u2019t have the same luxury, though \u2014 after losing his job at a restaurant, their sudden loss of income meant he had to pick up a few hours working at a landscaping firm. \u201cI\u2019m afraid that my husband will become infected, but we have no other choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe don\u2019t qualify for government help.\u201d\n\nThose twin anxieties \u2014 what would happen if her husband went to work, and what would happen if he didn\u2019t \u2014 were in Rojas\u2019s mind all the time.

Economists at big investment banks have warned more or less the same: Goldman Sachs recently predicted that U.S. GDP would shrink by 34 percent in the second quarter of 2020, compared to the first quarter of the year, and Morgan Stanley forecasts that this year, we could see the steepest drop in annual GDP growth since 1946.\n\nBut here\u2019s the thing: Economists aren\u2019t especially good at predicting recessions. In this instance, with at least 20 million people out of work in the U.S. and pretty much every country suffering from the pandemic, it seems almost certain that we\u2019re in one. But forecasting the path of a recession isn\u2019t an easy task under the best of circumstances. And we are not living through the best of circumstances right now. \u201cThis is not a situation where you can push a button on the computer and out comes a number,\u201d said Jonathan Wright, a professor of economics at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt\u2019s detective work. And it will mostly be wildly wrong.\u201d\n\nAnd we also don\u2019t know how it will be wrong. The forecasters are pretty much in agreement that the next months are going to be full of economic pain \u2014 but there\u2019s a lot less consensus about how quickly the economy will bounce back. Goldman Sachs, for example, is predicting an \u201cunprecedented\u201d recovery in the second half of the year, once businesses start to reopen. The chief of the San Francisco Federal Reserve Bank, meanwhile, says she\u2019s expecting a much more gradual return to positive economic growth. If anything, a recent study suggests that forecasters tend to be too optimistic about when recession recoveries will begin, which means the return to a normal economy could be slower and bumpier than many economists are currently predicting.\n\nLook at recession predictions for the past year, and you\u2019ll start to understand why some economists raise an eyebrow at some of their colleagues\u2019 efforts to play Cassandra. After a flurry of ominous warnings about an impending recession last summer, most forecasters were predicting a strong year for the U.S. economy. Gregory Daco, the chief U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, told me a story about a presentation he gave at a conference on the global economic outlook back in February. At that moment, the novel coronavirus mostly hadn\u2019t reached U.S. shores, but Daco had been keeping an eye on the virus in China and told the assembled crowd of economists that in a worst-case scenario, U.S. GDP growth could fall as low as 0 percent in 2020. Some people in the audience were not pleased. \u201cIt got back to me that they thought my estimate was way too pessimistic \u2014 there was no way we would be in an environment where the U.S. economy wouldn\u2019t grow because of the virus,\u201d Daco said.\n\n\u2018We shouldn\u2019t criticize early (COVID-19) models for seeming too pessimistic\u2019: Silver\n\nIt\u2019s amazing what two months can do. Now, with much of the global economy on lockdown, that prediction feels outlandishly optimistic. Daco\u2019s latest estimate is that the economy will contract by 4 percent over the course of 2020 \u2014 assuming a healthy rebound in the last few months of the year.\n\nLargely failing to predict the economic impact of the COVID-19 crisis, even when it was already wreaking havoc on one of the world\u2019s most populous countries, might seem like a huge mistake. But it\u2019s actually very normal for recessions to catch forecasters by surprise. Forecasters didn\u2019t just fail to predict the global financial crisis of 2008 \u2014 the recession had been rolling along for almost a year before it officially got the label. One study published in 2018 looked at more than 150 recessions across the globe and found that only a handful were successfully predicted by economists. Apparently, professional economic forecasters are an unusually sunny folk \u2014 or at least their predictions are. Research has found that economists consistently overestimate economic growth.\n\nAll of these challenges make sense, when you think about it. \u201cIt\u2019s not as if recessions are black swan events and we should never be prepared for them, but it\u2019s true that they are unexpected and hard to predict,\u201d said Prakash Loungani, an economist at the IMF who studies recession predictions. Forecasting models also rely heavily on historical data, and recessions are rare. Since 1970, the U.S. has only seen seven. And the very nature of recessions make them hard to predict based on the past. \u201cNo model that\u2019s used in normal times will forecast a recession because by definition, it\u2019s a break from normal times,\u201d said Claudia Sahm, the director of macroeconomic policy at the left-leaning Washington Center for Equitable Growth and a former economist with the Federal Reserve. \u201cSo you have to use your judgment and look at indicators, like the unemployment rate, for clues about what\u2019s going on.\u201d\n\nTo complicate matters further, each recession is unique, starting with the economic conditions that triggered it. That makes relying on history an even trickier business. \u201cThe last recession was connected to a financial crisis and this one is a public health crisis,\u201d said Tara Sinclair, a professor of economics and international affairs at George Washington University. \u201cThis is one of the problems in forecasting recessions \u2014 the people who are experts on the issues underlying the recession this time are not necessarily the same people who were experts last time.\u201d\n\nOnce a recession begins, similar dynamics usually start to emerge \u2014 consumer confidence falls, the stock market tumbles, the unemployment rate goes up. But assumptions about how recessions will unfold or how long they\u2019ll last may not hold up from one crisis to the next, and it can be dangerous to rely on them. A recent study by Loungani found that in 436 recessions since 1990, IMF forecasters mostly predicted a rapid recovery. (Consensus forecasters had a similar track record, but Loungani had a smaller number of predictions to analyze.) In many of those recessions, to be fair, the bounce back was pretty quick. But overall, Loungani found that forecasters did not do a good job of predicting which recessions would drag on for more than a year \u2014 including the global financial crisis of 2008, where economists predicted that a recovery was coming long before indicators like the unemployment rate returned to their pre-recession levels. That misplaced optimism about a quick return to normal may have actually prolonged the recession, according to research by Loungani and others, by spurring politicians to end fiscal stimulus measures before the recovery was fully in swing.\n\nThe COVID-19 pandemic is making economists\u2019 jobs even harder by taking some of the usual sources of uncertainty and turning them upside down. Unlike in past economic downturns, there is pretty much no debate about whether we\u2019re in a recession. That\u2019s in part because the recession was triggered by the government as it sought to respond to the pandemic. \u201cWe\u2019re aware of the economic problem almost immediately because the public health measures we\u2019re taking created it,\u201d Wright said. That\u2019s helpful in one sense, because it allows policymakers to respond quickly. \u201cBut it seems odd to say it\u2019s a good thing,\u201d he added. \u201cThe only reason we know we\u2019re in a recession so quickly is because the shock is just enormous.\u201d\n\nKnowing that we\u2019re in a recession also doesn\u2019t make forecasters\u2019 job easier. In fact, the trajectory of this crisis is even harder to predict because it\u2019s so dependent on external factors, like when shelter-in-place orders will be lifted. Wright said it\u2019s possible to get a reasonably accurate estimate of the short-term economic damage from indicators that update quickly, like weekly unemployment claims, electricity consumption or output from other sectors of the economy, such as industrial production or retail sales. But there\u2019s a lot we just don\u2019t know \u2014 for instance, how many small businesses will be able to reopen when the lockdowns end. Their ability to start rehiring workers will have a big impact on how quickly the economy can recover. And even rapidly updating statistics, like those unemployment claims, can\u2019t keep up with the breakneck pace of the economic crisis.\n\nDaco, whose company has started issuing biweekly forecasts for its clients, told me that he\u2019s simply expecting to be wrong a lot. \u201cAs forecasters, we have to approach this with a heavy dose of humility, because we just don\u2019t know how this will evolve,\u201d he said. \u201cOne day we could be assuming a 10-12 week lockdown, but the next day we could be looking at a lockdown that lasts through September and you\u2019ve got to throw yesterday\u2019s assumptions out the window.\u201d\n\nThat doesn\u2019t mean the forecasts are useless. But Sinclair told me it\u2019s better to think of them as a range of possible futures, rather than a reliable vision of what will come to be. Right now, she said, there are too many unknowns, starting with the question that\u2019s at the top of everyone\u2019s mind: When will it be safe to leave our homes again?", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/he-works-in-a-grocery-store-but-hes-still-losing-hours/", "published": "2020-04-20T13:40:46", "title": "He Works In A Grocery Store, But He\u2019s Still Losing Hours", "text": "As the coronavirus crisis stresses almost every facet of American life, we\u2019re featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nOvernight stockers at supermarkets were among the first Americans to see how the novel coronavirus might change people\u2019s habits.\n\nCharles Rodriguez, a 26-year-old employee of a supermarket chain in the Greater San Antonio area, had an early indication. Just over a month ago, he walked out of the store to help unload the delivery truck that brought in the next day\u2019s shipment. The sight stopped him dead in his tracks. \u201cIt looked like a holiday truck,\u201d he said, filled to the brim. But it was March 12 \u2014 not Thanksgiving or Christmas.\n\nThe store was preparing for the high volume of shoppers that would flood its aisles as the virus began to shut down many aspects of American life. Still, Rodriguez and his co-workers had no clue how quickly their workload would ramp up to meet the increased demand.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight\n\nHe went from working 32 hours a week to eclipsing 40 hours, even earning some overtime pay. \u201cWe\u2019d normally unload two pallets of low-velocity items [like canned foods and peanut butter]. But then we started getting 17 pallets,\u201d Rodriguez said. \u201cWhat was usually an eight-hour shift started becoming nine or 10 hours because of all the extra stuff.\u201d\n\nThat phenomenally busy streak for Rodriguez, who makes just over $15 an hour, went on for two weeks. But then it ended with a thud.\n\nThe supermarket chain started shifting other workers into overnight stocking, both to cut down on paying overtime and to make better use of employees in less essential departments. For instance, it\u2019s neither necessary nor safe for store employees to hand out food samples right now, so instead of laying those people off, the store has them refilling the shelves after closing. Since then, Rodriguez and many others in his department have actually lost hours.\n\nRodriguez said he appreciates his employer finding a way to avoid letting employees go, even if it means that he gets fewer hours and less pay. But it\u2019s been tough for his department. \u201cNow my shifts are closer to six hours per day, and I\u2019m losing about eight hours per week,\u201d he said. \u201cMy co-workers are hurting, and some of the original overnight stockers are kind of upset to have the extra help, because they want to hit their hours.\u201d\n\nNow that he\u2019s only working around 24 hours per week, Rodriguez said he\u2019s been far more conscious about his spending. His lawn mower stopped working \u2014 \u201cThe grass in our yard is really starting to grow,\u201d he said \u2014 but he\u2019s holding off on buying another one as long as he can. Similarly, his 2005 Kia Optima is on its last legs and has required a few trips to the mechanic. Rodriguez and his wife, Hilary, had been saving for a more environmentally friendly vehicle, but they have decided to put off that purchase for the time being.\n\nRodriguez is fully aware of the risks involved in continuing to work as the virus spreads, and his mother is worried about him. But he\u2019s more concerned about what would happen if he lost his job: He would lose his health care coverage, which helps him pay for the medication that treats his hypothyroidism.\n\nBut Rodriguez and his wife are grateful that their situation isn\u2019t worse. They are living at the house of his father \u2014 who is in the military and is stationed elsewhere \u2014 so they aren\u2019t facing the pressure of paying a mortgage or monthly rent. And as Charles\u2019s income has decreased during the pandemic, Hilary\u2019s has increased because of it.\n\nHilary works for a grocery-delivery service, and with people increasingly reluctant to leave their homes, she is fielding almost more orders than she can handle. \u201cBefore, she was happily working 28 hours a week. Now she\u2019s at 40,\u201d and making about $17 an hour, Charles said. \u201cWe basically switched places: She\u2019s making what I got on my old paycheck, and I\u2019m now making what she did before.\u201d\n\nIf there\u2019s an upside to working inside a grocery store these days, it\u2019s that the couple have been able to shop for themselves before or after their shifts, rather than making separate trips to pick over whatever might be left at busier shopping times. Workers can shop before the store opens each morning by showing their employee badges. (There are still strict item limitations, though, to prevent hoarding.)\n\nRodriguez and his wife have a storage bin of essentials in their home, just in case of emergency situations like this. \u201cWe still haven\u2019t touched it yet,\u201d he said.\n\nSimilarly, he hopes that his already-diminished hours at work won\u2019t drop any further. Grocery stores are among the most bustling businesses in the country at the moment, but even the workers who saw that boom coming are worried about the future.", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/at-least-22-million-americans-are-out-of-a-job-and-we-havent-hit-bottom/", "published": "2020-04-16T16:07:44", "title": "At Least 22 Million Americans Are Out Of A Job \u2014 And We Haven\u2019t Hit Bottom", "text": "It says something about the astonishing recent run of job losses in the U.S. that Thursday\u2019s number from the Department of Labor \u2014 5.2 million seasonally adjusted initial unemployment claims filed from April 5 through 11 \u2014 counts as a two-week decrease. In the prior week, 6.6 million Americans had filed for unemployment insurance; the week before that, it was nearly 6.9 million. But today\u2019s number still means that a previously unthinkable 22 million unemployment claims have been filed since March 15.\n\nThis decline might signal that the biggest single-week job-loss numbers are behind us, between the initial wave of layoffs and the backlog of people who were unable to file claims earlier because of overloaded state unemployment agencies. But as we noted several weeks ago, economists think there may be 25 million more Americans at risk for layoffs, based on the industries hit hardest by the COVID-19 pandemic. So even if the peak for weekly unemployment claims is over, the chart above could end up having a long tail, depending on how long Americans have to stay inside to combat the coronavirus.\n\nSome states are at different points in that progression than others. If we look at advance claims \u2014 which are reported weekly by state but are not identical to initial claims \u2014 we find that Maine saw the biggest decline week-over-week, with 57 percent fewer claims last week than the previous week. Claims in Michigan, which had seen huge total unemployment numbers, declined by 43 percent last week, more than twice as much as the national average (-19.9 percent). A similar story can be told in some other large states, including Ohio (-30 percent), Illinois (-30 percent) and California (-29 percent).\n\nOverall, only nine states or territories saw an increase in people seeking unemployment benefits last week, including North Carolina (+0.3 percent), Florida (+7 percent) and New York (+15 percent).

Using a combination of social distancing, tight travel restrictions and contact tracing, the country has kept its death toll under 100 people and seems to be leveling off its new cases. It\u2019s even managed to avoid closing schools. But despite the relatively minor impact the novel coronavirus has had on life in Australia, medical workers are still running low on masks, gloves and gowns.\n\n\u201cSuddenly it feels like a house of cards,\u201d said Simon Quilty, senior staff specialist at Alice Springs Hospital in Australia\u2019s Northern Territory. \u201cWe haven\u2019t quite [run out of personal protective equipment], but we\u2019ve come very close to it. We don\u2019t even have the pandemic. If we do get a pandemic, we\u2019re fucked.\u201d\n\nAll around the world, whether hard-hit by the virus or not, countries are running low on crucial supplies. And while shortages are largely confined to disposable medical items for now \u2014 personal protective equipment (PPE), swabs, chemicals used for COVID-19 testing \u2014 experts say other shortages are likely. The spread of SARS-CoV-2 (the virus that causes COVID-19) is affecting the way we manufacture all sorts of products, and the way we get those products to where they\u2019re needed. People who study these supply chains have seen problems coming for years. Now they\u2019re scrambling to get ahead of the pandemic, before it ends up affecting even our ability to produce the vaccines we hope will stop the disease in its tracks.\n\n\u201cUp until a few weeks ago, I knew very little about the supply chain,\u201d said Megan Ranney, a professor of emergency medicine at Brown University. \u201cIt always just worked. But I\u2019ve learned a bunch, and it\u2019s more fragile than we ever thought possible.\u201d COVID-19 has forced her \u2014 and lots of other hospitalists around the country \u2014 to become supply chain experts on the fly.\n\nA supply chain is a fancy term to describe how products get made and moved all around the globe. It\u2019s a simple concept, but not a simple process. Supply chains aren\u2019t a conveyor belt \u2014 they\u2019re a ballet. And there are many, many ways this spectacular show can fall flat on its face. The production of a single item often involves multiple factories in several different countries and depends on speedy, reliable international shipping to get each piece to the right place at the right time \u2014 and then to the buyers exactly when they need it.\n\nIn fact, experts in both manufacturing and medicine have spent years warning of the risks a pandemic \u2014 or another major disaster \u2014 could cause to supply chains. In 2011, for instance, Quilty documented that the hospital where he worked at the time had less than a 30 days\u2019 supply of penicillin and many other crucial pharmaceutical drugs. A 2017 paper by scientists with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention pointed out that PPE supplies had run into problems during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the 2014 Ebola virus epidemic, and warned that the system wasn\u2019t prepared to handle a sudden increase in demand. Multiple reports have been published on how avian flu pandemics could disrupt everything from computer manufacturing to the global food supply.\n\n\u201cPPE is the canary in the coal mine,\u201d Ranney said. She, and other experts, told me that right now, that\u2019s the main place we\u2019re seeing supply chains break down. But those same issues apply to damn near everything else we make and sell. The longer the pandemic goes on, the more products will be affected.\n\nThere are three big problems with the global supply chains, experts told me. First, the push toward lowest-cost production means a lot of cheap goods and cheap components of more valuable goods are made in places with low-cost labor. When those countries experience a pandemic outbreak \u2014 or when a pandemic interrupts transport from those countries \u2014 it creates a bottleneck.\n\nAround half the world\u2019s face masks came from China before the novel coronavirus pandemic began. The virus interrupted manufacturing there early on, Ranney said. Now, China can make masks again, but demand has jumped all over the world, and there are shipping delays. Several companies have told her to expect deliveries to take three or four weeks. In the meantime, she\u2019s been left to sort through sketchy, back-alley PPE dealers, some of whom produce low-quality masks that either fall apart or don\u2019t filter properly on testing. Other would-be suppliers have turned out to be basically the high-stakes equivalent of one of those \u201cyou\u2019ve inherited $3,000,000!\u201d email scams.\n\nAmerican manufacturing companies are starting to switch over production lines to make masks and other protective equipment here \u2014 but that\u2019s not a quick process and presents its own complications. For example, the nonwoven textiles that N95 respirator masks use to filter out viruses have to be made on special machines. There are only a few of those machines in the whole world, said Julie Swann, professor of industrial and systems engineering at North Carolina State University. And you can\u2019t just go buy a new one off the shelf. Her university is producing some of this material now. \u201cBut not at the volume you\u2019d make at a large manufacturer,\u201d she said.\n\nThe second problem is that a global pandemic causes sudden spikes in demand for certain products. Production is designed for steady demand with predictable increases and decreases. A big, unforeseen event, like a pandemic, throws everything out of whack, said Adegoke Oke, professor of supply chain management at Arizona State University\u2019s school of business. Take our toilet paper woes. That supply chain didn\u2019t account for sudden, nationwide increases in having to pee at home. It also didn\u2019t anticipate every office in the nation suddenly holding it, indefinitely. You might think that the demand in one sector could be met by the excess from the other, but it doesn\u2019t work that way. \u201cThe type of toilet paper you use in the office \u2014 the big rolls \u2014 are totally different from what you use at home,\u201d Oke said. \u201cThey require different supply chains and different manufacturing lines.\u201d\n\nAnd when manufacturing capacity can\u2019t keep up with a sudden surge in demand, there are no emergency backup supply closets to raid. That\u2019s because of a popular and widespread business practice called \u201cjust in time\u201d supply. Essentially, it means that businesses from hospitals to grocery stores keep only a small amount of supplies on hand at any given time \u2014 enough to get through a couple of weeks or a month. Just-in-time saves money on warehouse storage, energy and staffing, but it works only if the supplies can be produced and delivered when you need them. \u201cIt\u2019s been very successful,\u201d Oke said. \u201cBut at a time like this, the last thing you want is just-in-time.\u201d\n\nFinally, supply chains are also getting disrupted in some truly surprising ways \u2014 ripple effects that spread from one industry to another. Take the transportation of goods. Turns out, it\u2019s pretty dependent on European tourism \u2014 80 percent of the air cargo capacity across the Atlantic comes aboard passenger flights. When those all but stopped, it created a transportation bottleneck for manufacturing, said James Robinson, an independent consultant who spent 30 years working in vaccine manufacturing for companies like Merck. Airlines are turning their empty passenger jets into cargo flights, but that takes retrofitting and time and money \u2014 and it\u2019s going to increase the cost of shipping, Robinson said.\n\nThen there\u2019s all the food being trashed in response to a pandemic that\u2019s cleared grocery shelves nationwide. The same parallel but separate home and business supply chains that affect the toilet paper supply also affect food. What people eat in a restaurant or at school \u2014 and how much of it they eat \u2014 isn\u2019t the same as what they eat at home. And the farmers who have typically supplied commercial kitchens don\u2019t have the sales, marketing, packaging and transport networks in place to get their food where it\u2019s needed. Fresh vegetables and milk have simply been thrown out. And that\u2019s not to mention facilities\u2019 closing when food industry workers are taken out by illness or migrant farm workers\u2019 not being able to cross borders at future harvest times \u2014 things that researchers have long predicted could cause food shortages in the U.S. during a time of pandemic. \u201cThe food supply could be vulnerable,\u201d Swann said. \u201cAs much as I don\u2019t want to scare people.\u201d\n\nThese supply chain issues can also create a weird sort of feedback loop: The virus increases demand for certain products, which jumbles supply chains for those products, which in turn hampers efforts to use those products to keep the virus in check. And that gives the virus time to beat up the economy even more.\n\nWhich is all to say that problems with the PPE supply could be only the beginning. As people like Robinson try to coordinate what will become an international effort to manufacture a COVID-19 vaccine in the months ahead, for example, they\u2019re looking at what\u2019s going on with products like PPE \u2014 knowing that the same things could happen to vaccines.\n\n\u201cA vaccine manufacturer like Sanofi might source several thousand ingredients to make a vaccine,\u201d Robinson told me. \u201cBut each material is coming from factories with hundreds of sources, and those sources have sources.\u201d Like the connection between holiday travel and international shipping, supply chains for vaccines can end in unexpected places \u2014 like a Chilean tree farm.\n\nRobinson is vice chair of the scientific advisory committee for the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations, an international organization that helps coordinate funding and research for vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. CEPI is involved in the development of 10 different coronavirus vaccines, and Robinson expects at least three of those will eventually make it to widespread use. One of these vaccines, though, uses an adjuvant \u2014 a substance to help strengthen the body\u2019s immune response to a vaccine \u2014 that contains an oil extracted from the Quillaja saponaria Molina tree, common to Peru, Chile and Bolivia. The bark is harvested only between November and January each year, so this year\u2019s harvest didn\u2019t take the new coronavirus into account. There\u2019s only so much of that adjuvant available until next year, Robinson said.\n\nOther expected supply chain issues with vaccines are shaped by years of international trade patterns. For example, doses of vaccines are delivered in glass vials, and there\u2019s been a global shortage of glass stretching back to at least 2015. The medical glass industry was just beginning to catch up with increased demand, Robinson said, and now, novel coronavirus vaccines will create additional pressure. Even if the vaccine is loaded into 10-dose vials, that\u2019s still hundreds of millions of vials that will be needed, he told me. Janssen, a division of Johnson & Johnson, is developing a novel coronavirus vaccine that Robinson regards as one of the most promising. \u201c[Janssen has] already preordered 250 million vials, and that might be all that\u2019s out there,\u201d he told me. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to procure another 200 million.\u201d\n\nWhat it boils down to is that even the vaccine industry isn\u2019t prepared for a sudden increase in demand on this scale \u2014 which would likely far outpace even the spikes associated with a bad flu season. \u201cIn 2009, H1N1 rapidly increased manufacturing and got up to 400 million doses in a year. But for a pandemic, we might need billions,\u201d Robinson said.\n\nThe biggest thing experts are taking away from all this is the weakness of that just-in-time supply chain. \u201cIn lean terminology, inventory is waste because it\u2019s supply you aren\u2019t using,\u201d Robinson said. But now, when demand is sharply rising, that inventory would be helpful \u2014 and so many industries are tied together that when one runs out of supply it affects the ability of other industries to keep functioning.\n\nProduction can be ramped up, and it is. But it takes time and investment \u2014 and it\u2019s important to remember that those investments are a risk. We might need American-made masks now, but will we keep buying them after the threat of COVID-19 has passed? Or will we revert to just-in-time supply from cheaper factories overseas? History suggests the latter. During previous epidemics of influenza, Texas-based company Prestige Ameritech saw demand soar, Swann told me. But it proved to be a boom and bust. The company invested in new machines to meet demand during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, Swann said. \u201cAnd then they almost went out of business later because [the Texas company\u2019s product] was a little more expensive than the ones from China,\u201d she said. \u201cWe need to be willing to pay a little more during times of peace without crisis so we have supply available during crisis.\u201d", "author": ["Maggie Koerth"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/she-was-about-to-start-a-new-job-then-the-economy-collapsed/", "published": "2020-04-13T14:00:33", "title": "She Was About To Start A New Job.

To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience with us.\n\nJust over a month ago, things were looking pretty rosy for Laura Buda. After an eight-year run at a midsize arts company, the 32-year-old marketing and communications specialist from Virginia was offered \u2014 and had accepted \u2014 a new job with a much larger organization.\n\nThe new gig would provide not only greater upward mobility for the future but also a higher salary for the present. To celebrate the change, Buda and her husband went on a brief getaway to the Blue Ridge Mountains during the 10-day gap between the final day of her previous job and the first day of her new one.\n\nBut during that hiatus in mid-March, the new coronavirus began spreading aggressively throughout America. Like everyone else, Buda saw schools and businesses shutting their doors in response. And like many other Americans, she began wondering how COVID-19 might affect her new job. Perhaps they\u2019ll push back my start date by a week, she thought, or if things get really bad, maybe a month.\n\nThen, late in the afternoon on Friday, March 20 \u2014 three days before she was slated to begin her new position \u2014 she got a phone call. A member of the company\u2019s human resources department apologized profusely but said that the organization was being forced to rescind Buda\u2019s offer because of the economic fallout from the coronavirus.\n\nBuda is part of a gray area within the nation\u2019s reeling economy: those who left one job voluntarily for another \u2014 before COVID-19 spread and altered nearly everything in its path \u2014 but who never technically started working at the second gig. People like her are left in the lurch, not knowing whether they\u2019ll ultimately be eligible for unemployment insurance benefits.\n\nBuda\u2019s husband, who works as an attorney for the federal government, read through the unemployment stipulations carefully and told her he wasn\u2019t sure that her unique circumstances would qualify. \u201cThey ask you to list your last job, and I had to say that I left voluntarily,\u201d said Buda, still waiting to hear back about her filing. \u201cThere\u2019s a small area there to explain your circumstances a little more. But with how many people are filing for unemployment, I\u2019m not even totally sure that part will be read through closely.\u201d\n\nIf she ends up qualifying for unemployment, she estimates that it would amount to about $1,600 per month \u2014 a little bit less than what she and her husband had been paying in child care costs for their 16-month-old son, Dominic.\n\nThere have been some silver linings for Buda and her family, however. Her son\u2019s child care facility \u2014 which has continued to operate during the pandemic \u2014 has allowed parents to pull their children out of day care without having to pay during the crisis. (Some don\u2019t allow that.) And the recent coronavirus relief legislation lets some people with federal student loans temporarily halt their payments, which will save Buda about $450 a month. Perhaps most important: Buda\u2019s husband earns enough to support the family single-handedly. But they will still need to tighten their belts to get through this period.\n\nThe past four weeks have been a whirlwind for Buda. Not long ago, she had planned to buy clothes for the new job \u2014 something her bump in pay would have comfortably allowed. But now she counts it as a blessing that she never took that step. Instead of learning the ropes at her new gig, she spends her spare time \u2014 the time her toddler allows her to have \u2014 sifting through emails notifying her of openings she might be a match for.\n\n\u201cAnytime I\u2019m on the computer, [Dominic] wants to push all the buttons,\u201d she said.\n\nBuda vacillates between looking for jobs and thinking it\u2019s a fool\u2019s errand, given the state of the economy. She would love to find something in theater, a field she\u2019d worked in for a long time. But she\u2019s also looking for jobs at nonprofits; she thinks positions with organizations that are untethered to the marketplace seem far more stable now and over the long haul.\n\n\u201cThere are so many people who work in industries that, when things reopen, things aren\u2019t going to go back to normal,\u201d Buda said. \u201cIn theater, people aren\u2019t going to want to engage right away, even if it\u2019s deemed safe. I just think the recovery is going to be so much harder for something like that.\u201d\n\nCheck out all the latest coronavirus polling we\u2019ve collected.\n\nHow close are we to a COVID-19 vaccine? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Chris Herring"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/more-than-16-million-americans-have-lost-their-jobs-in-the-past-three-weeks/", "published": "2020-04-09T15:17:54", "title": "More Than 16 Million Americans Have Lost Their Jobs In The Past Three Weeks", "text": "The coronavirus\u2019s record-breaking run of bad economic news continues unabated. Thursday\u2019s numbers from the Department of Labor reported that 6.6 million Americans filed initial claims for unemployment insurance, roughly the same as last week (which was revised to 6.9 million) and about double the previous week\u2019s tally of 3.3 million.\n\nAdd it up, and over the course of three weeks, a total of 16.8 million seasonally adjusted unemployment claims have been filed. If we borrow the math from this Justin Wolfers piece in The New York Times last week, that means somewhere around 15 to 17 percent of the workforce might currently be without a job. (For comparison\u2019s sake, that number was 25 percent at the height of the Great Depression.)\n\nThe U.S. has had eight recessions since 1967, including the one we are almost certainly in right now. Of those, four (1969-70, 1980, 1990-91 and 2001) never reached our current level, over 16 million unemployment claims. For the others, it took a tremendous amount of time to reach that level: between 33 weeks (1981-82) and 51 (1973-75). Even in the Great Recession a decade ago, it took 42 weeks to get 16 million total initial claims. This time around, it has taken three.\n\nThis recession is moving at hyperspeed For U.S. recessions since 1967, number of weeks before reaching each benchmark for total initial unemployment insurance claims Weeks before no. of total initial claims Recession of \u2026 3,000,000 9,000,000 16,000,000 1969-70 13 33 Never 1973-75 11 31 51 1980 8 19 Never 1981-82 7 20 33 1990-91 8 22 Never 2001 8 23 Never 2007-09 9 26 42 2020* 1 2 3 *The current economic downturn hasn\u2019t yet met the traditional definition of a recession. Previous recessions were considered to have started midway through the month they officially began and ended midway through the month they finished. Sources: Department of Labor, St. Louis Federal Reserve, National Bureau of Economic Research\n\nNow, it\u2019s important to remember that the U.S. population has also increased by 66 percent since 1967, meaning there are more workers to potentially file claims now. Furthermore, total initial claims are not equivalent to the number of people who are actually receiving unemployment benefits. And, of course, economists look at much more than just unemployment when determining whether a recession has happened.\n\nThat said, the sheer job-loss numbers for this recession \u2014 and the velocity at which they were amassed \u2014 are difficult to comprehend.\n\nGoing back to previous recessions, some analysts see parallels to the 1981-82 downturn. That recession is considered to have been triggered by changes in monetary policy, when former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker aggressively raised interest rates to combat inflation. By comparison, this recession was triggered by widespread stay-at-home orders that effectively shuttered countless businesses and put millions out of work. (We should note that economists almost unanimously agree that this was the best decision not only for public health reasons but also for the long-term economy.) Many jobs were lost in the early 1980s, but the unemployment rate quickly dropped after the initial shock, which may provide a model for people to return to work swiftly after the coronavirus crisis lifts.\n\nAgain, though, that early 1980s recession took much longer to reach present levels of jobless claims, so in many ways our current recession represents an unprecedented situation. That\u2019s particularly true when you consider the underlying reason why people can\u2019t go back to work \u2014 a novel virus for which a vaccine is still quite far off \u2014 and the uncertainty around what its eventual timeline will end up being. One thing is for sure, however: Most of us have never seen a recession produce such extreme economic hardship, so quickly, as what the U.S. is going through right now.", "author": ["Neil Paine"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/media-coverage-doesnt-actually-determine-public-opinion-on-the-economy/", "published": "2020-04-08T12:00:15", "title": "Media Coverage Doesn\u2019t Actually Determine Public Opinion On The Economy", "text": "In mid-February, Wall Street was celebrating the stock market reaching record highs. But the stock market has since lost roughly 20 percent of its value in the wake of the coronavirus, and the broader economy is in freefall as well. A record number of Americans have filed for unemployment benefits, and the March jobs report found the economy had lost 700,000 jobs \u2014 the first time that number has declined in a decade.\n\nBut even though large swaths of the economy have shuttered with extraordinary speed, this economic downturn is likely to hit some people and places much harder than others. Those disparate effects, in turn, raise a question that is critical for politics as well as economics: In a country as large and diverse as the U.S., how do citizens know whether the economy is doing better or worse?\n\nOne obvious source of information is the news media. In fact, some political scientists have found that negative news coverage of the economy can shape public opinion, especially in an election year. Marc Hetherington, for instance, found that media coverage in the run-up to the 1992 presidential election was more negative than the economy warranted and cost incumbent President George H.W. Bush support. That could be particularly telling now, considering this is all happening just months ahead of a presidential election, and a strong economy has historically boosted the incumbent president\u2019s chances of winning reelection.\n\nBut in a 2017 \u201cResearch & Politics\u201d article, Eunji Kim, Soojong Kim and I found that the news media\u2019s ability to influence Americans\u2019 perceptions of the economy may be overstated. Our analysis found that major media outlets\u2019 coverage of the economy is much more likely to lag public perceptions than to lead them. That means that the media coverage of an economic recession, like the one we seem to be headed toward, isn\u2019t independently reshaping how Americans think the economy is doing. Instead, we found that media coverage often follows public opinion.\n\nWe used nearly 40 years of data from the University of Michigan\u2019s surveys of consumers, a long-running survey that asks Americans their views of the economy, to create a monthly index of Americans\u2019 level of concern about the economy. We then compared that index to a measure of how 24 different media outlets covered the economy during that same time period, including big national newspapers like The New York Times and The Washington Post as well as regional papers like the Houston Chronicle. Systematically measuring media outlets\u2019 coverage in nearly half a million newspaper articles and television transcripts proved a bit more challenging. But similar to our approach with the economic survey data, we created an index, this time using words associated with positive or negative economies \u2014 words like \u201cbear,\u201d \u201cdrop,\u201d \u201cjobless,\u201d and \u201clayoff,\u201d as well as \u201cbull,\u201d \u201cgrowth,\u201d and \u201cinvest\u201d \u2014 to score the tone of economic stories published by these outlets.\n\nAnd if we drill down into one of the most prominent media outlets we analyzed, The New York Times, we find no indication that media coverage is shaping public opinion. A telltale sign of media influence would have been if the tone of the Times\u2019s economic coverage shifted before public perception does. But as you can see in the chart below, that didn\u2019t really happen. Instead, the public\u2019s perceptions of the economy more often seemed to lead news coverage rather than lag behind it. For instance, during key moments such as in the run-up to the Great Recession in 2008, the public grew more pessimistic well before the Times\u2019s tone shifted.\n\nIn fact, this was the case across the 24 media outlets we analyzed. There were some outlets for which we found that the tone of media coverage consistently led public perceptions of the economy, but overall, we found no strong evidence that media coverage pushed Americans as a whole to perceive the economy in one way or the other.\n\nGiven how much attention politicians devote to the tone of media coverage, these results may seem surprising. But we\u2019re actually not the only researchers to conclude that public perceptions aren\u2019t heavily influenced by how the media frames the economy. H. Brandon Haller and Helmut Norpoth, for instance, found that citizens\u2019 perceptions of the economy didn\u2019t vary much based on their news consumption habits.\n\nStill, other studies find evidence that the influence can run in both directions, with the tone of media coverage sometimes anticipating public perceptions. For example, Stuart Soroka, Dominik Stecula and Christopher Wlezien found that public perceptions can anticipate media coverage, but also that media coverage can actually lead public perceptions of how the economy has performed but not perceptions of how it will perform. After examining the tone of economic coverage in the four highest-circulation national newspapers, though, Amber Boydstun, Benjamin Highton, and Suzanna Linn conclude that media coverage can predict how Americans view the economy even after accounting for the state of the economy itself.\n\nOn two key points, then, academic research has been consistent: Public perceptions of the economy can get out ahead of media coverage, and public perceptions are also closely connected to actual economic conditions. This suggests that there are critical limits to the media\u2019s influence on public perceptions, which is consistent with other research that shows the impact of elite opinion is often overstated.\n\nIn other words, when the economy shifts directions, the news media\u2019s capacity to reshape public perceptions of the economy is limited at best. It\u2019s easy to pick up a newspaper and assume that its writers and editors can shape public opinion, but that doesn\u2019t seem to be true of the economy. Rather, the public reacts to real-world economic conditions, not media spin.\n\nWould it hurt the economy to let people die from coronavirus? l FiveThirtyEight", "author": ["Dan Hopkins"]}, {"link": "https://fivethirtyeight.com/features/americas-social-safety-net-wasnt-ready-for-the-coronavirus-crisis/", "published": "2020-04-08T11:00:03", "title": "America\u2019s Social Safety Net Wasn\u2019t Ready For The Coronavirus Crisis", "text": "The coronavirus crisis is testing almost every facet of American life, including the country\u2019s social safety net. For generations politicians have proposed (and haggled over) ways to help people during a garden-variety recession. And in the past few weeks, Congress has tried to strengthen the safeguards that already exist, passing a series of bills to get government assistance and other protections to more people, including a $2 trillion relief package with several provisions that directly affect workers and small businesses.\n\nBut most of these benefits haven\u2019t reached Americans yet, even as more and more have been forced to rely on the preexisting safety net. Since the coronavirus crisis began to intensify, FiveThirtyEight has been reporting on which workers are most economically vulnerable, and what the government can do to help. We\u2019d like to continue that by featuring the stories of people who are struggling to stay afloat, finding unexpected financial opportunities or simply changing the way they\u2019re thinking about money, the economy and our country\u2019s social safety net. To do that, we need your help \u2014 we want to hear how the coronavirus crisis is affecting you economically. Please share your experience by filling out this form.\n\nToday, we\u2019re bringing you three stories that illustrate a fact of American life that has become abundantly clear over the past few weeks: Our unemployment support systems are woefully underprepared for this crisis. That has caused delays in how quickly help can get to the people who need it most, and threatens to deplete states\u2019 financial reserves. Congress just injected $260 billion into the state unemployment insurance system, and most Americans will eventually receive $1,200 relief payments. Because of the way our unemployment insurance system is set up, many Americans are still struggling to file unemployment claims, and the amount of government assistance they\u2019ll receive will also depend on where they live. In the meantime, jobless workers are scrambling to pay their bills and discovering other cracks in the makeshift social safety net that\u2019s been created to catch them.\n\nWe talked to three young women whose stories show how the response has varied so far.\n\n\u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof.\u201d\n\nThe prospect of an economic downturn never really worried Lee Meach, 29, of Tampa, because there\u2019s always demand for her work as a pediatric occupational therapist, even in a sour economy. She thought it was her husband, Josh Frank, an urban designer who co-owns a landscape architecture and urban design firm, who had the unstable job. But soon after Florida public schools began to close and their county rolled out social-distancing ordinances, Meach\u2019s boss announced that the clinic where she works would be closing its doors for the foreseeable future. She and all her co-workers were laid off indefinitely.\n\nMeach was stunned \u2014 and unprepared. \u201cI always thought my job was recession-proof,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I went from being extraordinarily busy to unemployed in less than a week.\u201d She and Frank had bought a house three months earlier, so she was immediately concerned about how they would pay the mortgage \u2014 much less their student debt. That concern morphed into panic when she began to investigate Florida\u2019s unemployment insurance system and found that the state would pay only up to $275 per week in benefits, just a fraction of what she had been making at her job.\n\nThe coronavirus crisis is putting a lot of pressure on the unemployment system and exposing the dramatic variations in states\u2019 relative generosity or stinginess with benefits. The federal government is attempting to standardize how much money people like Meach will receive by tacking an additional $600 per week onto every unemployed person\u2019s benefits for the next four months. But because of steps that some states like Florida have taken to restrict their unemployment insurance program, government aid to jobless workers will still be distributed unevenly.\n\nIn the wake of the Great Recession, Florida was among the states that created a complex patchwork of requirements for jobless workers. The state also capped benefits at 12 weeks \u2014 far below the national standard of 26 weeks. As a result, the share of unemployed workers receiving benefits in Florida and several other states with similar restrictions fell precipitously. In 2019, only 11.3 percent of the out-of-work population in Florida was receiving benefits, down from 30 percent in 2007. That recipiency rate \u2014 the share of unemployed people who actually receive benefits \u2014 is far below the 50 percent experts told us is typical during normal times, although that share usually rises during recessions.\n\nMany of the most burdensome restrictions have now been lifted in response to the coronavirus crisis, which means it should be easier for workers to receive benefits. And in fairness to Florida, states that were distributing benefits to a bigger share of unemployed workers were also unprepared for the recent influx of claims. But even with the additional $600 per week, jobless Floridians will still be getting far smaller payouts than workers in other states, where the maximum payments can be two or three times higher. And that\u2019s assuming the money makes it into their wallets anytime soon. Hours after Meach was laid off, she went online to submit her application to get unemployment benefits, only to be confronted by an antiquated and labyrinthine system online. \u201cYou can\u2019t refresh or you\u2019ll lose all your progress,\u201d she said. \u201cIt took me about three hours to figure out where to upload my resume.\u201d\n\nIn the meantime, she and Frank have scrambled to find other sources of income. He picked up some shifts taking calls and doing administrative work at his father\u2019s small business, while Meach grabbed a few extra hours as a remote lecturer. They also took advantage of their bank\u2019s offer to defer their mortgage payments. Meach finally got her unemployment application submitted by logging onto the website in the early morning, more than a week after she lost her job. By some measures, she was lucky \u2014 Florida\u2019s online system has been functioning so poorly that the state director of unemployment announced last week that his office will start issuing paper applications for jobless workers to mail in.\n\nBut Meach doesn\u2019t feel especially victorious, because she still has no idea when she\u2019ll actually get the money. \u201cWe\u2019re doing a lot to try to make things work financially,\u201d she said. \u201cBut the unemployment benefits are a big piece of the puzzle for us, so it\u2019s very stressful to wonder when and if that\u2019s going to come through.\u201d\n\n\u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nThe bad news started for Chloe Carter-Daves, 21, when she lost her part-time job at a restaurant in New York City in mid-March. It continued when \u2014 after weeks of daily attempts \u2014 she still wasn\u2019t able to submit a claim for unemployment insurance. And it culminated in the discovery that because she\u2019s a student, she won\u2019t be receiving a $1,200 relief check from the federal government like most Americans, even though she\u2019s been supporting herself without help from her parents over the past few years.\n\nThe vast majority of Americans will receive a payment from the federal government over the coming weeks. But college students (and some high school students) fall into a kind of no man\u2019s land: They often don\u2019t file their own tax returns, even if they\u2019re basically self-sufficient, which means they won\u2019t qualify for the relief checks. And their families won\u2019t receive a child payment for them either since they\u2019re over the age of 16.\n\nFor some students who are living at home, that might not be such a burden. But Carter-Daves, a senior at Hunter College, stayed in her off-campus apartment, which means she\u2019s still paying for her own rent and groceries. \u201cI\u2019ll be real \u2014 even when I was working, I was living paycheck to paycheck,\u201d she said. \u201cThat $1,200 would have given me another month of breathing room.\u201d\n\nCutting most college students out of the relief payments could turn out to be a particularly big oversight because young workers are at an especially high risk of losing their jobs right now. As Ryan Best and I wrote on March 18, workers under age 25 are disproportionately more likely to lack both paid sick leave and the ability to work from home. Younger workers are also especially likely to work in the service and retail sales industries \u2014 which have both been among the hardest-hit sectors of the economy.\n\nIf Carter-Daves can get her unemployment insurance claim through, she says she should be OK financially, at least for a while. Her home state of New York has fairly generous benefits for jobless workers. But it was unprepared for the recent tsunami of unemployment claims in a different way. A Department of Labor report from February named New York among six states whose unemployment systems don\u2019t have enough money in their reserves to handle a normal recession. And, so far, the federal government hasn\u2019t taken steps to bail out cash-strapped state and local governments, which means that big states like New York and California are at risk of quickly burning through their unemployment insurance funds.\n\nBut more than two weeks after Carter-Daves lost her job, the website seemed to have become even less functional. \u201cFor a while, the issue was that I would start my application, get halfway through, and then the website would crash,\u201d she said. \u201cNow when I log in, there\u2019s no more option to file a claim.\u201d She\u2019s far from the only New Yorker for whom wrestling with the unemployment insurance website has become a full-time job \u2014 last week, Gov. Andrew Cuomo apologized for the site\u2019s frequent crashes and said the state was working on fixing the problems.\n\nIn the meantime, Carter-Daves applied for an emergency assistance grant from her school and got enough money to cover her April rent. But she\u2019s already worried about future bills \u2014 particularly since, as a college senior, she\u2019s facing the dismal prospect of graduating into a frozen economy. \u201cI was planning on leaving the service industry once I graduated,\u201d she said. \u201cNow I think I\u2019m going to be grateful if I have any income at all.\u201d\n\n\u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time.\u201d\n\nBefore the coronavirus crisis hit, Rebekah Guerra, 26, was already living on a shoestring budget in Los Angeles County. Faced with a mountain of student and medical debt, she moved back in with her parents last year while she tried to jump-start her business as a freelance marketing professional. But over the course of a few weeks in March, any semblance of financial stability evaporated. \u201cI work with a lot of smaller businesses, and they\u2019ve either closed their doors entirely or marketing is not their focus,\u201d she said. \u201cI can\u2019t really blame them \u2014 what is there to market if they have no business? But it means my work has completely gone away too.\u201d\n\nUp until recently, freelancers and independent contractors like Guerra were left out of the social safety net for jobless workers, since they don\u2019t usually qualify for unemployment insurance. That changed with the new bill passed by Congress, which created a new emergency unemployment program to cover them. But it could be complicated for states that are already swamped with claims to set up a new infrastructure to funnel funds to freelancers, whose incomes will be harder to verify. There are also questions about which freelancers will qualify, since according to new guidance from the federal government, people who can telework with pay are ineligible \u2014 and it\u2019s not clear what that will mean for people like Guerra, who are theoretically able to work from home but have lost all their business. Experts estimate that it could be weeks before the payments are actually distributed.\n\nAnd for Guerra, any delay could bring her closer to financial catastrophe. She has a chronic health condition that requires her to spend hundreds of dollars a month on medication. And she struggled to pay for her health insurance premium at the beginning of the month. \u201cI\u2019m reassessing my budget \u2014 giving up subscriptions, thinking about things like whether I can go to a lower level of coverage on my car insurance,\u201d she said.\n\nAll of this means that, to Guerra, the prospect of receiving government benefits \u2014 through unemployment insurance or a stimulus check \u2014 feels tantalizing but remote. \u201cThe help is great, but I don\u2019t know if it will get to me in time,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I had a financial buffer before this. I understand the system is overloaded and I want to be patient, but my bills are coming due now.\u201d\n\nWhy it\u2019s so hard to make a good COVID-19 model", "author": ["Amelia Thomson-Deveaux"]}]}, "nbpostgazette": {"rss": "http://nbpostgazette.com/feed/", "link": "http://http://nbpostgazette.com/", "articles": [{"link": "https://nbpostgazette.com/games-like-corruption-of-champions/?utm_source=rss&utm_medium=rss&utm_campaign=games-like-corruption-of-champions", "published": "2020-05-14T04:46:06", "title": "Best Games Like Corruption Of Champions (COC) You Must Play!", "text": "Best Games Like Corruption Of Champions: Corruption of Champions is basically an erotic text-based as well as a browser-based flash game.

At the time, the nation was in economic devastation after years of internal conflict, and the new president was forced to evasion on debt expenditures to European governments.\n\nIn response to that, France, Britain, and Spain sent the naval forces to Veracruz, Mexico, challenging recompense. Britain and Spain discussed with Mexico and removed their forces.\n\nFrance, on the other hand, ruled by Napoleon III, decided to use this chance to shape a territory out of the Mexican region. Late in the year 1861, a well-armed French navy captured Veracruz, landing a great force of troops and driving President Ju\u00e1rez and his government into departure.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla\n\nCertain that accomplishment would come quickly, 6,000 French troops under General Charles Latrille de Lorencez set out to outbreak Puebla de Los Angeles which was a small town in east-central Mexico. From his new head office in the north, Ju\u00e1rez curved up a disparate force of 2,000 loyal men\u2014a lot of them either native Mexicans or else of mixed heritage and were then sent to Puebla.\n\nThe massively outstripped and below-par supplied Mexicans, headed by Texas-born General Ignacio Zaragoza, encouraged the town and equipped for the French attack. On May 5, 1862, Lorencez assembled his army\u2014maintained by hefty weapons, before the city of Puebla and headed an attack.\n\nFacts about Cinco de Mayo\n\nCinco de Mayo celebrates the victory of the Mexican army over France at the Battle of Puebla on 5th May 1862.\n\nCinco de Mayo is sometimes mistaken for Mexico\u2019s Independence Day. The Independence Day of Mexico is celebrated every year on September 16 which is the most significant national holiday in Mexico, honouring the Cry of Dolores, which started the war of Mexican independence from Spain.\n\nNot all the Mexican celebrates the Cinco de Mayo, as the people in Puebla only celebrate the day. The reason behind it is that Puebla is the place where the unlikely victory was taken place, because of which the celebrations aren\u2019t countrywide. Cinco de Mayo is also not a federal holiday because of which the day is just like any other day for most people in Mexico.\n\nThe Battle of Puebla was a part of the Franco-Mexican War. One of the whys and wherefores it\u2019s so important is for the reason that the French army was much grander and more equipped than the Mexican army. They had more weapons and men at their disposal, but still after having all that the French lost the battle to Mexico.", "author": ["Prabhat Singh", "About The Author", "Prabhat Is A Consistent", "Hard Working Content Creator With Specialization In Tech", "Finance Niche.

Then, the lawmakers did not hesitate to question the move that the Trump\u2019s government made. They had their reasons, but that is a matter of another day. Is that possible to paralyze the operations of the space agency? If that becomes a reality, what is the future of NASA? How will they get past that? It is what our piece is all about. For projections, you should keep reading.\n\nDuring the hearings before the panels of Senate and House, two NASA officials came before them. First, there was the manager of NASA who is in charge of the human spaceflight activities. The other one was the inspector general of the same space agency. In addition to that, there were opinions of other experts. The topic of discussion was the fate of the ISS if the White House plan succeeds.\n\nThe proposal begged one question. Can a private company manage all that including the research facilities and the astronauts in them? As the people tried answering that, it became a debate. Points of concern are in the discussion that follows.\n\nThe demand for an orbiting laboratory for a successful commercial venture was of concern. If it was an essential facility, it was unclear as to whether it would operate without receiving any support from the government. There are other questions yet unanswered. They include the necessity of the research of Mars and Moon, whether China will benefit from the step and the feelings of other ISS\u2019s partners regarding the matter. What the cost of flights come in the 2020s is also unknown.\n\nAccording to Paul Martin, he has an answer for one of the questions. The inspector general of NASA said that there a low chance of a commercial operator to entirely manage to operate the ISS come 2025. That does not come as a surprise because the budget as of 2024 will be about $1.2 billion.\n\nTwo senators oppose that move. They are Ted Cruz as well as Bill Nelson. Supposedly, it is not the first time such a thing is happening. In the past, such an incident cost the state billions of dollars and its citizens a lot of jobs. If that lesson will hold waters or not, remain a mystery as of now.\n\nAs we wait to see what unfolds, there are things hard to ignore. For the last thirty years, NASA has invested hugely into the venture. Through design, construction, and operation, the agency has spent $100. Annually, its budget is between 3 and 4 billion dollars. There is so much at stake for a cost that little. The fate will unveil soon.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/there-could-be-a-sixth-military-branch-hints-trump-space-force/", "published": "2020-05-12T11:10:10", "title": "There could be a Sixth Military Branch Hints Trump \u2013 \u2018Space Force\u2019 \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "If Trump\u2019s words see the light of the day, the United States\u2019 security will be tighter than ever. The deduction of a possibility was after a speech. Last month, while addressing the West Point football team, he remarked a space force military branch. During that speech at the White House, he went further to express its function. Once a war would be beyond the atmosphere of the earth, the branch would be in charge of the same.\n\nBack in March while in California, the president highlighted the idea to the members of the military. It has for a long time had support from the Congress. However, the headquarters of the United States Department of Defense by the name Pentagon are not for the idea. The milestone would be remarkable. Why not when that would be the first new sector since 1947 when the establishment of the Air Force took place?\n\nAccording to Trump, he was floating the idea. He said that he wasn\u2019t serious about the matter, but it was not a bad idea altogether. The need of the force is because of the enormous amount of work carried out in the space. He acknowledged that he warmly welcomes a possibility of having space corps.\n\nTerry Virts had something to comment on the matter. He said that it wouldn\u2019t mark the beginning of space operations by the military. The source is reliable because Terry once served as a commander of the International Space Station. Equally important, he was a veteran of the U.S. Air Force for three decades. What did he tell Peter O\u2019Dowd of Here & Now? Read on to find out the opinion of this legend.\n\nHis thoughts were as follows. The space department in the force is not a new thing. It is common to countries and states with a stable military, and the United States is not an exception. In the case of the United States, that happened half a century ago. Therefore, it is not about creating a military branch in space. It should be about making the existing one better and productive. In addition to that, military\u2019s organization should be in a more efficient manner.\n\nSince the Pentagon is against it, the chances of its existence are low. The Air Force is already complicated according to its secretary, Heather Wilson. This idea will only make the matter worse. On the other hand, war is taking a different shape. The next one would be in space as far as Rogers is concerned. What happens next is something that all we can do is wait for eagerly.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/spacexs-cost-reduction-is-a-bitter-pill-for-the-ariane-group-why/", "published": "2020-05-12T10:10:10", "title": "SpaceX\u2019s Cost Reduction is a Bitter Pill for the Ariane Group \u2013 Why? \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "SpaceX is very excited and is working tirelessly to make their boosters reusable. That will consequently reduce the cost of the launches. That is good news but not for the camp of the Ariane Group. What is the group about in the first place? The French-based team is a leading contractor for the Ariane 5 launch spacecraft. Equally important, it is working on the Ariane 6 as of now. Why is it not happy with the new development then? Read on to find out more about the situation in hand.\n\nFor years, the Ariane Group has been one of the few favorites that NASA runs to when in need. Did you know that it is the firm whose booster propelled the James Webb Space Telescope? That being a multi-billion dollar project speaks volumes. However, they are afraid that the current state would change. SpaceX is making the launch market extremely competitive, and that poses uncertainty of whether the Ariane Group will survive.\n\nIt is not alone in this. There is also Russia as well as the United Launch Alliance. Nevertheless, they are in a worse position. The reason is that they created the Ariane 6 rocket for one purpose only. They wanted an equal counterpart for the Falcon 9 rocket of SpaceX. The problem is that it is competing with a firm that has reduced the prices of the launch to about $62 million.\n\nWhy can\u2019t they go for that cost then? That is because as much as they would like to, they need to offer a price that will be 25% higher than that of SpaceX when Ariane 6 is ready. In addition to that, they will be prepared in 2020 and not earlier than that. While waiting to do so, SpaceX is through with their Falcon 9 boosters. If they were to offer relatively low prices, where would that leave the Ariane Group? The cost once they have used a Falcon 9 booster could get even less than the first one. That is much to handle.\n\nAlain Charmeau, Ariane Group\u2019s chief executive, made it clear about the frustrations are real. Now there is the United States and Europe competing for the commercial space jobs. According to Charmeau, SpaceX is already at an advantage. Therefore, it will be in a position to offer low prices. Will the Ariane Group survive with such a price margin?

JAXA is one of the accomplices in the NASA drove International Space station (ISS) and saw ISS as a testbed that can lead to the Moon and in the long run too, Mars. Onishi, who is a resigned business carrier pilot, joined the JAXA space explorer corps in the year 2009 and spent right around four months on board iss IN 2016.\n\nHe is among the nine Japanese space travelers, another of whom, Norishige Kanai, is installed ISS at this moment. Japan, Canada and 11 European nations working under the aegis of the European Space Agency(ESA) have come together with the United States in what is known as ISS since the program started. President Ronald Reagan guided NASA to create a space station in collaboration with different nations in his 1984 State of the Union Address. Japan, Canada, and Europe immediately showed their enthusiasm for joining. In 1988, with the consenting to of an Intergovernmental Arrangement (IGA), they formally moved toward becoming accomplices with the United States in building Space Station Freedom. In 1993, after the crumple of the Soviet Union, Russia additionally joined. The plan was changed for that, and different reasons and the program ended up known as ISS. A changed IGA was marked by every one of the nations in 1998.\n\nAmong research modules on ISS was made by Japan. (The others were given by the United States and Europe.) The Japanese Experiment Module (JEM), named Kibo (Hope), is the greatest and the special case that has both a pressurized volume and an unpressurized \u201cback patio\u201d where examine that necessities to introduction to space can be set. JEM likewise is notable as the ISS module from which CubeSats are conveyed into space. Additionally, Japan fabricates and dispatches HTV (or Kounotori) spacecraft that convey freight to the ISS roughly once per year. It is right now building up an enhanced, less expensive adaptation, HTV-X.\n\nTalking at H2M and a workshop sorted out by JAXA\u2019s Washington office, Onishi laid out Japan\u2019s present arrangement for utilizing its involvement with Kibo and the ISS in extending human investigation of room in participation with NASA.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/cygnus-cargo-spacecraft-launched-by-antares-to-iss/", "published": "2020-05-12T08:10:10", "title": "Cygnus cargo spacecraft launched by Antares to ISS \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "On 21st May, a Cygnus cargo spacecraft was launched by an Orbital ATK Antares rocket to the International Space Station (ISS) with an objective, which might be the swan song for the organization as an independent team.\n\nThe launch program takes five minutes and gets completed when Antares get lifted from the Mid-Atlantic Regional Spaceport, Wallops Islands at 4.44 am Eastern. Controllers shifted the launch from the starting to the finish of the window due to weather conditions that make the countdown progression easier.\n\nThe Cygnus spacecraft will be placed into the orbit by the rocket only in nine minutes after liftoff. Also, the twin solar arrays of this spacecraft will deploy after 60 minutes. As per the official information, the spacecraft will reach the ISS on the early morning of 24th May.\n\nAs per NASA ISS program Manager Kirk Shireman, the launch was simply excellent & amazing. He was at the post-launch briefing and also said that I am very happy with the beginning & progression of this mission.\n\nThe spacecraft carried around 7385 pounds of cargo for the International Space Station that consist of crew supplies, scientific payloads, and hardware for ISS.\n\nWhen it comes to scientific payloads, there is the Cold Atom Lab on the spacecraft. It is an experiment that utilizes lasers for slowing down the atoms before they become completely motionless. It further cooling the atoms to the temperature that will be quite low when compared to the temperature of our planet. Also, it has the Biomolecule Extraction and Sequencing Technology Experiment whose main purpose is to test the tool that makes the sequencing of DNA quite easily.\n\nAdditionally, the Cygnus will be used by NASA for testing their power to boost the orbit of the station.

This exceedingly circular circle will augment the measure of sky the shuttle can picture, enabling it to screen substantial swaths of the sky constantly\n\nTESS will perform one final engine burn on May 30 to achieve this circle, they added. The rocket is relied upon to start its two-year science mission in mid-June, in the wake of wrapping up adjustment and authorizing work with its four installed cameras. Such work is as of now in progress. TESS has snapped its first test picture with one of those cameras. The photograph, which was taken on April 26, is focused on the southern heavenly body Centaurus and shows in excess of 200,000 stars.\n\nThe edge of the Coalsack Nebula is in the correct upper corner, and the brilliant star Beta Centauri is unmistakable at the lower left edge. TESS is relied upon to cover in excess of 400 fold the amount of sky as appeared in this picture with its four cameras amid its underlying two-year scan for exoplanets. A science-quality picture likewise alluded to as a \u2018first light\u2019 picture, is required to be discharged in June. TESS will correctly screen stars\u2019 shine, searching for little plunges that could be caused by outsider planets crossing the star\u2019s appearances. This travel technique has been utilized by NASA\u2019s Kepler space telescope, which has found around 70 percent of the 3,700 known exoplanets to date. TESS is relied upon to coordinate or surpass Kepler\u2019s pull in absolute numbers, mission colleagues have said. Also, on the grounds that TESS will center around stars in the sun\u2019s neighborhood, space experts will have the capacity to think about a portion of these recently discovered universes top to bottom utilizing different instruments.\n\nFor instance, the NASA\u2019s $8.8 billion James Webb Space Telescope, which is planned to move in 2020. Should test the climates of no less than a couple of TESS planets, searching for water vapor, oxygen, methane and different gases that can be an indication of livable condition. The Cost of TESS mission is assessed to cost around $200 million, despite the fact that, the dispatch administrations added another $87 million to that aggregate.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/china-launches-the-first-private-space-rocket/", "published": "2020-05-12T04:10:10", "title": "China Launches the First Private Space Rocket \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "OneSpace Technologies conducted the main private rocket dispatch in Chinese history this week, shooting the 9 meter OS-X from a stage in northwest China on Thursday, as per CNN. The rocket is accounted for to have achieved an elevation of 40 kilometers and traveled about 273 kilometers from the platform. The ultimate objective is to charge under $10,000 a kilogram for freight, some portion of a general push from Beijing to help rouse the development of private space firms that can work independently from the aggressive China National Space Administration yet will likewise facilitate on some innovative work ventures if the need emerges.\n\nThe OS-X rocket will gather information for an examination venture the startup is dealing with the Aviation Industry Corporation of China, a state-claimed organization. This is what was written by CNN. The organization said that it created OS-X over a time of one year. However, Hong Kong University of Science and Technology advanced plane design lecturer Xin Zhang told the news network he had questions if the rocket was unique outline work and OneSpace\u2019s $78 million spending drove him to speculate they used a couple of traps.\n\nContender SpaceX needs to cut down the cost of space dispatches with reusable rockets and is by all accounts quickly realizing that objective with a progression of fruitful tests. OneSpace may cost essentially not as much as SpaceX, and it has yearnings of turning into the biggest little satellite dispatch organizations on the planet, yet as indicated by the Verge, OS-X is just equipped for conveying 220 pounds into space\u2014a drop in the ocean contrasted with the Falcon 9\u2019s 50,000+ pound limit. It likewise utilizes strong rocket fuel, which means parts can\u2019t be reused after dispatch.\n\nVerge went ahead to state that the dispatch was an exceptionally real development however the organization has huge contenders including a portion of the individuals who are in China and level out of China. It\u2019s as yet vague if OneSpace can have a major effect with regards to little satellite markets. There are a lot of contenders who are focusing on the dispatch of little satellites from huge organizations like Virgin to little new companies like Rocket Lab to backbones like the Orbital ATK, which are all endeavoring to grasp the about a large portion of a trillion dollar worldwide business. It isn\u2019t yet certain whether the United States of America or some other western satellite organizations would purchase a ride on a OneSpace rocket. The United States of America government do put strict controls on the export of satellites, until a couple of years prior, they were named weapons.", "author": []}, {"link": "https://satprnews.com/2020/05/12/weird-asteroid-discovered-in-jupiters-orbit/", "published": "2020-05-12T03:10:15", "title": "Weird Asteroid discovered in Jupiter\u2019s orbit \u2013 satPRnews", "text": "Again an interstellar asteroid has been found. This time it is within Jupiter\u2019s Orbit. As per the latest report, it is going to stay for a long-term rather than moving away from its position. In the previous year during October, astronomers with the help of Pan-STARRS telescope which is kept in Hawaii declared that they have found out a new kind of abnormal-shaped rock that just whipped past the Earth to a far longer distance. This particular asteroid which was later on named as Oumuamua and was the first interstellar object ever to be discovered in the solar system.\n\nBut it is now found out that Oumuamua is just moving past. The other interstellar asteroid which is known as the 2015 BZ509 is believed to have positioned itself in the Jupiter\u2019s orbit since the inception of the solar system and that was around 4.5 billion years ago. The scientists have just released this data. This asteroid was believed to be identified in the year of 2014 and in November. The shape is in the form of an oddball. One of the most striking features of this space rock is that it revolves around the Sun in the opposite direction to which the Earth, Jupiter and even some other objects move.\n\nIt is still a mystery which is yet to be unlocked that how an asteroid which is orbiting Jupiter can move in a direction opposite to that of the movement of the Jupiter. According to a scientist, if this particular asteroid was supposed to be a native of this solar system, it should have moved in the same direction as that of Jupiter and other objects in our solar system. These space objects are believed to have been formed from the cloud of gas and dust.\n\nHelena Morais who is a study co-author and based out of Sao Paulo State University in Brazil have performed various computer examinations that tried to find out the reason as to why this asteroid is making such reverse movements.\n\nAccording to the researchers, the Sun was formed among dense clusters of stars and came out of the same giant gas cloud. Scientists believe that at such an extended period, there would have been much more friction among these sibling stars and their small planets than the solar systems which are situated far away experience in today\u2019s date.\n\nSo 2015 BZ509 may not be the single interstellar object that is moving in such a peculiar manner in the space.", "author": []}]}, "insidertradings": {"rss": "https://www.insidertradings.org/feed/", "link": "https://www.insidertradings.org/", "articles": []}, "truthfulreporter": {"rss": "https://truthfulreporter.com/feed/", "link": "https://truthfulreporter.com/", "articles": []}, "highlandmirror": {"rss": "http://www.highlandmirror.com/feed/", "link": "http://www.highlandmirror.com/", "articles": []}, "thefinancialanalyst": {"rss": "https://theanalystfinancial.com/feed/", "link": "https://theanalystfinancial.com/", "articles": []}, "reportagestuff": {"rss": "http://reportagestuff.com/feed/", "link": "http://reportagestuff.com/", "articles": []}, "tokenfolks": {"rss": "https://tokenfolks.com/feed/", "link": "https://tokenfolks.com/", "articles": []}, "heraldanalyst": {"rss": "https://heraldanalyst.com/feed/", "link": "https://heraldanalyst.com/", "articles": []}, "findmarketresearch": {"rss": "https://heraldanalyst.com/feed/", "link": "https://www.findmarketresearch.org/", "articles": []}}}
